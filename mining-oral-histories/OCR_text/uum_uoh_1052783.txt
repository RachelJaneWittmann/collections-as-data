 THIS INTERVIEW WITH DR. D. F. BEYELER, VETERINARIAN AND COUNTY COMMISSIONER, TOOK PLACE ON AUGUST 5, 1970 AS A PART OF THE URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH AND CALIFORNIA STATE COLLEGE AT FULLERTON. THE INTERVIEWERS ARE STEVEN GUTTMAN AND JOHN DONNELY.
SG: Would you give us some background on yourself, about when you first came to Moab, and why you came here.
DB: Well, I first came here on June 23, 1962. I had lived out West here before in western Colorado, and like this area. I hadn't really planned on Moab specifically, but when I was in Grand Junction, I was talking to another
practitioner there who said that he had been coming over here. He and some of his colleagues expressed the need for a veterinarian in this area. Consequently, I came over here in the forepart of June and looked around a little. I liked the area and came back then to stay the 23rd day of June, 1962. Apparently there was a need here because I drove in about 3 o'clock and by 5 o'clock word had gotten around that there was a veterinarian in town and someone was knocking on the door wanting some work done. I've been here ever since.
SG: Had this town had any full-time veterinarian in the past? DB: Oh, no, no. They had flown in for clinics, inoculation clinics. They had come down from Salt Lake, Grand
Junction, and Cortez. Occasionally, I guess ' Dr . Blackburn came down from Price, too. Of course, he's no longer up there, but that would have been the closest. Moab, geographically, sits about 120 miles in every

SG: DB: SG: DB:
D. F . BEYELER
direction from the next practitioner.
You say you had been in the area before?
In western Colorado, yes.
Had you traveled through this area at any time?
No, I'd never been to Moab. My family moved to western Colorado, Fruita, in 1945, and I lived there. I finished high school there, graduated from high school, and I worked there a year or two right after high school. Then I went back East. I was born in upstate New York. I went back to work there for a few years after high school for
my brother-in-law. I went in the army, the service, and then I came back out, and I rodeoed professionally for one year full-time for a rodeo producer back East, traveling up and down the east coast. Then I went to Mesa College for two years at Grand Junction, Colorado, took my veterinary training at New York State Veterinary College. Then I was in practice in Maryland two years and came back out here.
JD: Between your practice here and your practice in Maryland, what are the main differences?
DG: Well, of course the biggest thing you encounter right away are the distances you have to travel, and, of course, the fact that here it's all-inclusive; you have no specialization. Everything within this area presumably
goes through my clinic here. Of course the drawing area
2

 DR. D. F . BEYELER
is not what you have in the eastern areas; a town with a fixed population of six thousand in your eastern areas will have your adjacent drawing areas, which will justify possibly two, three maybe more practitioners, which you don't have here. You have your populations that's here in
the valley, and that's it. Well, we do draw some from Paradox, Green River, and Monticello. I guess you could consider these a drawing area, but I guess it's usually a matter of preference: whether it's closer to here, closer to Grand Junction, Price, or Cortez. This would be the population to draw from. Outside of that, roughly, the practice will be equivalent. It's a much more leisurely practice here, at least mine is.
SG: Does the isolation around the area cause you any special problems as you practice?
DB: The biggest problem we have is shipping in vaccines and other biologies that have to be refrigerated. This did cause a great problem until now. We've got the transportation problem pretty well solved. One way we do this, of course, is bulk purchase and special shipments
maybe buy a whole year's supply of vaccine at once. In other areas, rather than keep your money tied up in your inventory, you just rotate your stock. Statistically,
you're supposed to rotate your inventory every 90 days; here you can't do that, especially with your refrigerated
3

 DR. D. F . BEYELER
products. This is the big things; it's a problem.
JD: Outside of that there aren't any other problems caused by the isolation?
DB: Not really, no--except, minor irritations, the laboratory work and preparing of specimens for autopsy, you know, pathological specimens, things like this. Here again it's the distance. You just learn to live with it, accept it. It doesn't really create any problems, maybe minor inconveniences.
SG: I understand that you've become involved in a lot of the local political affairs and civic affairs since you've been here.
DG: (Laugh) Yes, I always considered that up to probably 1964, the reason I was a Republican was because my father was. After that time, I kind of got involved in politics
on my own.
SG: What offices have you held?
DB: The one I have now; I'm on the county commission. I've
worked locally in the Republican Party, of course. I'm the precinct chairman now, this year, and I have been a state delegate, county delegate, this type of thing.
These are the only political offices I've held.
JD: Of course, this area here is pretty heavily Republican. I
guess that makes the job a little bit easier then.
DB: Yeah. It has been predominately Republican, I think
4

 DR. D. F . BEYELER
there's probably quite a bit of cross-over. I think you get this in these small towns. You're more apt to get a cross-over in small towns for local candidates. When you get on the state and national levels, predominately your party vote will hold. If you can check this out statistically, I think you'll find this.
JD: People tend to vote personality more than party then, locally?
DB: I think so. It has an advantage. There's no question, however, when you are registered. If the area is predominantly Republican, and you register Republican, you have a certain advantage. I don't know what this would be. But there's no question you would have an advantage.
JD: Do you have any trouble with people, say, like the miners, who aren't active and kind of come and go, being apathetic in the elections and not voting at all?
DB: We have here probably one of the highest turnouts of qualified voters of any county in the state.
JD: So that everyone participates?
DB: I think so. Here, again, it's hard not to in a small
community if you're here any length of time. Well, if you're here long enough to become a qualified voter, it's hard not to get involved in something in town. Immediately when you become involved in something, you
5

 DR. D. F . BEYELER
automatically become involved in politics. You know, it's
just inevitable that you do. We have at this time, I think, something like forty-seven service clubs in town. So assuming that they meet only once a month for the five-day week, you've got just about two meeting a night that you can attend. You're bound to be approached by one of these service organizations. When you get into a service organization and make contacts there, you immediately come under a sphere of influence. Dr. William spoke to us here a while ago. He says that everyone has a sphere of political influence, whether they realize it or not. Many become involved this way. Virtually of necessity, you become involved because our adult entertainment here is movies, TV, or a service club and any special events. Your day-to-day entertainment boils down to these events. So unless you want to sit at home and watch the boob tube, you usually attend one of these
meetings. I think this probably has a lot to do with it. JD: What year did you come to Moab?
DB: In 1962.
JD: Did you notice anything that was left over from the
uranium rush?
DB: No, I was here after the boom, so
hit here even on the decline of believe that particular summer
to speak. In fact, I the potash boom. I and fall they were
6

 DR.
JD:
DB:
D. F . BEYELER
building a railroad, and I think Morrison Knudson (MK) started moving out.
Texas Gulf?
Yes. The prime contractors that dug the shaft had started cutting back. I mean they were virtually completed, and they were gradually turning the work over to Texas Gulf at that time. They were phasing out the prime contractor
for the shaft. The contractor had virtually completed the railroad, so I came here on the decline of the potash boom.
Did you even try to isolate what your impressions are of the miners? Did you ever notice anything different? Like,
maybe they worked a little harder and played a little hard, or they're kind of their own type of group set apart from the rest of the citizens?
An independent breed? Oh, yeah. This, I think, is true of not only miners, but you get this in any transient population, the transient construction workers, and the pipeline workers. Yeah, I'd say definitely.
JD:
DB:
JD: Were a lot of them active in there different civic clubs that you were in?
DB: Well, some. This is a little hard for me to answer. I never looked at it that way. Some of them were. At that time, of course, a lot of these people were the rugged outdoor type of individual. I was active in a wildlife
7

 DR.
JD:
DB: JD: DB:
D. F . BEYELER
club, and I knew quite a few of them who were active this way. So possibly this type of organization, yes.
How about when people cam for the different mining operations? When Atlas and other large organizations brought a lot of people in, did these people join civic clubs, or did they pretty much stay to themselves?
You're talking about the administrative personnel?
Right.
I think of necessity they were active. I don't know if this is company policy for the large corporations, but I
would think it would be advantageous to them. They're a large segment of our financial support, via county taxes, encourage people to be active in civic organizations. I'm sure large corporations do, not only as a public relations bit, but as a practical matter, watch especially in politics to see where their money's going.
I think they would. Now I don't know that this is a policy of Texas Gulf, but I'm sure they wouldn't discourage persons where they didn't bring disfavor on the corporation itself. Under a hot controversial issue, I imagine they would tell the guys to soft-pedal it, but this is just from a practical standpoint. From Texas Gulf we had a member serve on the school board. These people had worked for them in management, say, as opposed to the labor force. We've had them active in the political
8

 DR. D. F . BEYELER
campaigns, not as employees of Texas Gulf, but as citizens.
JD: In the same regard, you are on the county commission and just as an individual, have you noticed that miners have any trouble with alcoholism high than the rest of the
citizenry?
DB: Probably not with alcoholism. Maybe they make a little
more noise and they play a little rougher, but as far as alcoholism, I don't think so. Now you're talking about the hardcore alcoholic. I don't think so. I don't think in mining, as a profession or as an occupation, you could tolerate alcoholism. If you're out there in that mine, you don't want somebody operating the equipment when your life's depending on it. You know, this will pretty well take care of itself.
JD: How was the atmosphere when you came here after the boom versus before the boom?
DB: Pretty much the same. These people and even the people that were here a short time, I think were real friendly,
and it wasn't long before you knew them by their first names. Granted, it was for a short time, but the feeling is still there; it's pretty much on a first name basis. Here again, I don't think you'd differentiate between the citizens that were here, the old-timers or the native population, as opposed to the miners. It is about the
9

 DR. D. F. BEYELER same.
SG: What clubs were you and are you a member of?
DB: When I first came here, I was very active in most of them. I was in the Jaycee's and the Lion's Club. I belonged to the chamber of commerce; I was a director at
various times and vice-president on year. The VFW, Eagles, Elks, Masons, Utah V eterinarian Medical Association, American Legion, Wildlife Club, and of course the Republican Party.
SG: Have you noticed that there are any certain clubs that lead people to become active in politics, not counting, of course, the political parties themselves? Have the activists come from certain clubs?
DB: Well, I think you'11 find this here. The same people, essentially, probably 80 percent of your active member in the clubs are the same people. Because they are active, they're in these clubs; and thereby they make the clubs active. The Rotary and the Lion's Club are your two most active service clubs, and the chamber of commerce which, I guess, you could call a service club. Of course, you don't have the same membership in the Rotary and the
Lion's. I guess now their rules are stringent enough that they don't allow dual membership. But probably 90 percent of your businessmen in town who are active either in politics or in civie affairs belong to one or the other
10

 DR. D. F . BEYELER
of these two clubs. Maybe even a higher percentage than that.
JD: Do they become active through the clubs, or are these the type of people who would be active regardless?
DB: Yeah, I think probably they would be active people regardless, but these active people form these clubs, and so it's a self-propagating thing. These are the two clubs in town that have the membership, the backbone of the citizenry. Consequently, the more active people that are really out there, that are going to do something, drift this way.
SG: What year was it that you became a county commissioner? DB: I was elected in 1966. My term expires this year.
SG: Are you running for reelection?
DB: Oh yes.
JD: What has been the main problem that you've come across, or the main areas that you've had to spend most of your time on as a county commissioner?
DB: Well, we've had a problem with our airport out here, for one thing. Another is this dissension that started about a year after I was on the commission, a constant dissension between the city police department and the
sheriff's department. I understand they had this before; maybe it's just that I'm more aware of it now because I'm on the commission. I'm sure they had some before. I was
11

 DR. D. F . BEYELER
pretty active locally, you know, in politics, and I was pretty active locally, you know, in politics, and it didn't seem so bad to me then. Also we had a change in sheriff. We've had this dissension that has created a lot of problems. We've had a narcotics problem here. I think that this friction between the two departments has impeded solving some of these problems. Probably our big crime problem right now is narcotics. And I'm sure that this dissension has impeded the progress of some of our investigations have lead to interdepartmental friction. That and other basic policy differences that I have with the Democrats would be essentially the problems encountered.
SG: Is County Commissioner a non-partisan office?
DB: Very partisan.
SG: Very partisan? This problem with the police department is
it jurisdictional or strictly a personality conflict? Are there some areas they both think they have authority over?
DB: No, I think it's gotten to the point where it's a personality thing. I think there was probably some question in previous administrations as to where the power lies. There's no question in my mind about the jurisdictional matter, but I think it has gotten to a
point where personality has become involved. I don't
12

 DR. D. F . BEYELER
know. I think it's in personalities.
JD: In what way has this dispute hampered solving the drug problem?
DB: This will go back to what basically causes the drug problem. My philosophy about law enforcement is that you w ill have wha t the public demands. Eventually, this is what you will have, one way or another. So I think it's a laxity on the public's part, maybe a failure to recognize
it, a failure to be able to cope with it. The failure to cope with it is the fact that they don't recognize it. Up until lately, there's been a stigma. You know, it was sort of like a venereal disease. You don't want to talk about it because it's not nice and you just kind of, you know kept it under wraps. So maybe this is why we've slowed down our progress. Of course, we could go into a discussion of court procedures and court philosophy starting with the supreme court down I think interdepartmental jealousy possibly has, in cases, isolated cases, caused one department to jump the gun when the other department is doing some groundwork investigation; in other words, alerted the enemy. I can
back this up with fact. I'm convinced it has happened.
SG: There hasn't been any team work, then, between the two
organizations at all?
DB: Hasn't been for three years. At one time it was just
13

 DR. D. F . BEYELER direct antagonism.
JD: Is that the reason why, in a 1ot of these newspaper articles that we read about Moab, they have picture of the offices, and they always list their names and tell where they're from? That's a rarity, at least for the newspaper reading I've done. They usually don't do that.
DB: I think so. I'm biased, I'll admit, and probably shouldn't discount it, but I feel that the press is biased; the newspaper and radio are biased. It's not hard for me to make this statement, but it's hard, possibly, for a lot of people to accept this statement. They say, "You're biased," you know. Well, I admit I am. But it's very interesting to me that you, an outsider, would notice this because I think they are biased. I'11 admit I'm biased. But it doesn't discount the fact that you
should try to be fair. You're bound to be biased to a certain extent, but I feel the press, radio, and TV are biased. I think if you looked into it from strictly objective point of view, you'd find it. But it's interesting to me that you made this statement. I'm kind
of in agreement with Spiro Agnew's opinion on this.
JD: That was just a casual observation on my part.
SG: What kind of things do you think are going to have to be
done to overcome this conflict that exists now?
DB: I think the outcome of the election will determine what
14

 DR. D. F . BEYEL ER
type of law enfor cement people want. When i s this coming
out, incidentally?
SG: Oh, quite a while.
JD: We've got about seven hundred hours of t ape .
DB: The election will be determined by then, so I don't want
to use this as something that the opposition can use about me. After the election, the sheriff and I are going to be pretty much in harmony as to his office and my office and law enforcement in general. If the people decide that this is the type of government they want, then he is the sheriff and I, assuming that we are re- elected, will damn well get up and make public some policy statements. This, I believe, will be indicated by the polls. Most of the people know now how I feel about running the sheriff's department, I'm sure, if it hasn't been prostituted by the press, radio, and TV. But, maybe this will help. I don't know that it will, but at least, if we're not re-elected, it isn't going to make any
difference anyhow.
SG: Is the sheriff now elected or appointed?
DB: Elected. We carry our county sheriff as a carry-over from
the old English system of government, and in my opinion, this is generally accepted. The highest l aw enforcement officer in any county is the sheriff. he is an elected official, and this is the type of law enforcement people
15

 DR. D. F . BEYELER
want. I think possibly in the past the commission has had
more influence on the sheriff's office than they should have had. I don't think this is a tribute to the commission. I think this was a weakness on the part of the sheriff's department. Consequently, I can justify saying this because the people elected a new sheriff. And I think that the election in November will indicate whether the people are happy with this kind of law enforcement that he and I advocate for them. So I think we'll go from there. If it isn't, if we're wrong, they'll tell us at the polls; if we're right, then I think we can be a little more positive in our assertions.
SG: So you want the sheriff's office to be more autonomous than it has been in the past? Is that what you're saying? DB: What I'm saying is that the damn police department should get off his back and quit agitating him. In my opinion, it's just that simple. I think a lot of this goes right back to the mayor and city council because the police
chief is an appointed official, and all the council and mayor would have to do is say, "Get the hell off his back," and that would be it. He'd be looking for a job. This is my philosophy of the two departments. I have been living with the thing for three years. We've had three different police chiefs and at one time no police chief, which is when we had the most harmony. We have had this
16

 DR. D. F . BEYELER
problem. There are appointed officials as opposed to elected officials. I think that maybe they aren't actually instigating this agitation, but they could damn sure stop it if they wanted to.
SG: Besides the problem between the police and the sheriff, are there any other areas where the city and county come in conflict or is this an isolated instance?
DB: In the rest of it, we work very well with the road departments. In fact, we are probably situated here in the most ideal spot in the state of Utah to go to a metropolitan form of government, but we can't do it because the legislature won't let us. Better than 95 percent of our population lies within the Moab Valley; of that, 70 percent is within the city and the other 20 percent is right adjacent. We could very easily go under one type of government; we have few outside cities or towns. We've got Cisco, Thompson, Castleton, twenty, twenty-five people, forty people. We could go under a one-government system here very easy, and we would eliminate all this conflict. But here again, this would require special legislation. See, we went into this
study, and this is the main thing that justifies my position, I think. The Law Enforcement Planning Agency were down from Salt Lake talking about this consolidation of the sheriff and the police department and, of course,
17

 DR. D. F . BEYELER
they are going to kick this around in Salt Lake too. Finally we got a state supreme court ruling that they could contract services. So we went into the study. They though it was very feasible and wrote a letter to this affect. "However", they said, "the political situation at this time doesn't justify it." So, I think that ended it.
JD: I was wondering about the sewage. You came here in 1962 and the situation was bad for sewage, sewers, and related problems.
DB: We built the sewage plant; there were some added costs there. The engineer who designed this plant was hired by the previous administration. Subsequently, that administration was voted out, and the new sewage plant
was built. I think it is adequate. I think that they figured on about a population of twelve to fifteen thousand. We haven't had any water shortage since I've been here. I'm on city water out there. We formed a water improvement district to cover the area of Spanish Valley on beyond what is now served by the city. We formed this last year. The state health department has said there
will be no more shallow wells out in Spanish Valley. We came to a point of this urban sprawl where we either had to develop a water system and allow people to keep septic tanks, or, if they wanted to drill wells, to build a sewage system. In essence, the septic tanks were getting
18

 DR. D. F . ~EYELER
too close to the wells because of this urban sprawl thing. So the cheaper of the two ways, and the more
logical seemed to be to develop a water system. So it became a water improvement district. Of course, since then we've had a little decline in population; there hasn't been a big demand. But when and if we go into a big development out there, this is what we'll have to go to.
JD: Have there been any problems with zoning since you came in?
SG: I know there were problems with the trailers and houses.
DB:
We entered into contract when T itle VII and t hese poverty programs came into being. Of course, several planning consultants sprang up all over Utah; we hired one here. We paid him in the neighborhood of $24,000, I think, to develop a master plan. This was started way back before I was even on the commission, probably when I first got into politics. Our main concern up to that time was naming the streets, the platting of the streets as they appeared on the plats of the government small tracts. Sb as the area would develop, they wouldn't be building houses in the middle of dedicated streets and where we
essentially planned them. That was in 1964 when we started this. At that time I suggested to the commission that they could get one of the state college, the land
19

 DR. D. F. BEYELER
grant colleges and the Department of Urban Development to come down and work with us through our county extension services. A very short time later, we entered into a plan
through this Title VII got some federal matching funds, and hired a big consulting firm out of Denver. They worked on it two years; didn't do too much. So the local officers grew disenchanted with these people, turned around and hired another consultant in Salt Lake City. He completed the master plan project about two year ago. It was adopted by the city planning commission and the city council; the city commission hasn't adopted it yet. I objected to the whole thing violently from the start; a great waste of money for what we're getting. Subsequently, they held hearings, and they've had hearings since, and this is where it stands today. I'm still objecting to it. Right after I got on the commission, which we were doing the zoning--we have a zoning ordinance--we went into this and found out that the zoning ordinance had been published wrong. Finally by just keeping at it, we finally got a zoning ordinance and zoning map, which in the opinion of our county attorney was a valid map. So we started using this, or though we were using it. We had this problem come up here with this
junkyard out in the valley. I still contend that if we can't enforce this zoning ordinance, then it is useless
20

 DR. D. F . BEYELER
to pass another, and it looks like we can't enforce this one.
JD: In your opinion, what is the primary reason why the existing one can't be enforced?
DB: I think it's strictly that the commission doesn't want to act. It's up to the commission to make a decision. They've bandied the thing around for three years. Our building inspector has come up and said, "What are we going to do with this junkyard out here?" And it's been kicked around and a little heat put on it from time to time, been kicked around three years. So two weeks ago I thought that since we had issued them a business license, that any issuing authority had authority to revoke a license. I asked the county attorney about this, and he said, "Well, you better hold a hearing." So we held a hearing lastс Monday. I know that the junkyard owner hadn't lived up to his agreement because I was there when he made the agreement. This present operator had taken it over from another operator, and he agreed to keep all junk behind a fence except used cars which were in running order that he had for sale. He was licensed as a
used car dealer, not as a junkyard. These other items were parts; you can get into a question of semantics and label definitions and so on. But anyhow, he agreed to this, and I was there when he agreed to this. This was
21

 DR. D. F . BEYELSR
about three years ago. So he came up there then, and I asked him point blank then. He said he didn't have anything out in front of his place except used cars that were in running order. And I said, "How long has this been?" He said, "Since the building inspector had been up there." So I just went out, got into the truck, and drove up there, and I listed a few things that I found that were junk. I came back and told him this. He didn't say too much. Then the recommendation was that we would suspend his license for thirty days to allow him time to clean it up. So they're going to work with him another thirty days, and if he isn't cleaned up, why, I supposed they'll suspend it. I don't think they'll ever suspend the license. But as I say, if they can't enforce this, which I think is one of the most flagrant abuses of zoning in the county, I just don't see how they're going to enforce any of them.
JD: Is this your main objection to the master plan?
DB: No, there's a letter on the file up there on my big objections to the master plan. It's fine for heavily populated areas the size of Grand Junction or something. We're going into conjecture here and development, and
we've already had some legal repercussions on this from a large landowner north of town. We've already had some changes in this from the original plan. The plan to me,
22

 DR. D. F . BEYELER
the setup, from a theoretical standpoint, would've been nice, but it's not practical for Grand County; we're not that wealthy a county. We're talking about these islands in the center of Main Street and this type of thing. Well, you know, this is way out of the financial means of
the city to begin with. They planned a tourist center down here on First South; already they've decided to move it north of town. The plan isn't even adopted, and they've started making changes. The restrictions in there on subdivisions, if they're passed, are going to skyrocket the costs. Their trailer ordinance would be to my advantage because I have a licensed trailer court in the county. When I read that, I went down and renewed my license because it gives me an advantage to sell my property. It restricts all trailers to trailer courts in the county. Now this is ridiculous. Two years ago, 80 percent of all low cost housing in the United States was mobile homes. During the boom here, I dare say that 90 percent of the people here were in mobile homes, and they weren't in trailer parks. But as long as they conformed-- this is my theory on zoning--as long as they conformed to health and fire regulations, I get a little touchy on
this subject of zoning. I think when you start zoning, you're adjusting the real estate values. I don't know whether you'd call it liberal or what, but as far as a
23

 DR. D. F . BEYELER
person's development and design are concerned, solely on his own property, and if this is what you're doing for this reason, I don't think real estate men should be on the zoning boards. I think this is a real conflict of interest. We've got them there. But I think this is what you're doing. As long as you are not endangering the health or the safety of your neighbor, you should be left
pretty much to your own devices. These are just too restrictive. Here again we go back to this original issue: if we can't enforce what we've got, we're not going to enforce these new ones. A law that isn't enforceable, in my estimations is worthless; it's worse than worthless. This is one reason why I made such a point of enforcing this one particular segment of zoning.
There's other in town that need cleaning up too. This is the worst looking thing. It's on the highway. I made such a point of it just to prove the point that if we can't enforce this, why propose new ones. Is this an interview or my campaign speech?
JD: It will be kind of a prediction. By the time this gets out and you get a copy of it, the campaign will be over and you'll know if you're right or wrong.
DB: That will be interesting.
JD: May I ask the name of the junkyard man there?
DB: It is Burt Swink.

 DR. D. ~. BEYELER
SG: Yes. This is just how it sounds, Burt's Auto.
DB: He sits down, and this irritated me; I don't mind a guy
thinking I'm not too bright, but I hate him to think I'm stupid. I asked him, "You mean that you don't have anything outside of your fence now except used cars that you have for sale?" He says, "Yeah." So I just went up there and saw him once; it hasn't changed that much since I've seen him, I'm sure.
JD: Are these zoning requirements that they're talking about enforced on a steady basis?
DB: The argument for it was that we needed some zoning ordinances. We needed something, and therefore we should hire a professional since these federal funds are available. And then we got into another philosophical discussion on federal funding. They thought essentially, I think, that they would put the monkey on somebody else's back, hire an expert to design this. If there were any repercussions, why, they could hire another guy to redesign the plan.
SG: Redesign it; an endless cycle. You mentioned that there was a problem with the airport. I assume its surface is what you are talking about. Is there anyway to permanently solve this? It seems like they've had problems out there before.
DB: Yes. I might just as well get in trouble with the highway 25

department. The philosophy of the highway department--and this, again, is my theory. I was told this by knowledgeable people, but I agree with them. They had known of the Mancos shale short comings. In fact, one of the fellows that ran against me on the commission n the primary last year is quite knowledgeable in road construction. He's a surveyor. He told me during the building of the airport that they had problems out there. He says, "Look at the road beside it." The philosophy of the Utah Highway Department with Mancos shale has been,
"Let's ignore it. Maybe it will go away some day." I'm talking now about ten years ago. The state of Colorado says, "Well, it looks like a problem. Let's try and solve it. Let's set up some test sites; let's do something that will be right." So they collaborated with the Asphalt Institute. The reason the Asphalt Institute did it. I'm sure, is to develop an asphalted product which would solve it, and that's to their advantage. I mean, this is a smart thing on their part. Walt Howett is with the Asphalt Institute; he's a recognized authority there. I checked around in the highway departments everywhere, and here again is a man that is held in high esteem by his
colleagues, by his oppositions, and by other people. So apparently he is quite knowledgeable. I was quite impressed with him personally. He went out there, and at

that t i me they had been conducting tests near Grand Junction, next to the airport on Interstate 70. I went over there twice; I was with the highway super in t endent one time and an engineer. I followed it up the next year;
I brought back engineering reports for the engineer to read because, well, this is like reading an autopsy report, you know. It was Greek to me. So they ran tests over there for a couple of years, and the recommendation of the Asphalt Institute at that time was to use this membrane type of structure which we're talking about again at this time. This was about three years ago. At that time we could have done it for, I think, about five or six hundred thousand dollars; now the cost they figure is a million. Now is there a cure to it? They seem to think this would do it. The Asphalt Institute engineers are leaning this way. If we attempt to go to a permanent solution, I'm sure we'll go this way because one of the members of the Federal Aeronautics Board likes this design. He's impressed by this type of construction utilizing asphalt. Any funding we'll get is going to have the approval of this board. So I'm sure if the project is completed, I think this is the right way to go. But I think we've wasted a lot of time here if we were going this way. There have been just as many solutions postulated as there are people. Here agai n I have t o go
27

    DR. D. F . BEYELER
back to Walt Howett. His predictions and theories have been proved so far, so I think the guy probably knows what he's talking about. I think we've got further indication that this would work. I was talking to our engineer. We put another seal coat on there, and it looks like, in essence, we have created a membrane type of structure. Our old surface has created a membrane on top of this. Where this was done, we're getting a pretty good surface. However, on the outskirts of this resurfaced area which goes down the middle of the runway, there's about ten feet on each side of the surface running alongside of this area that they fixed. This has started to buckle. This, to me at least, has proven that the theory is basically sound. If we go to this, it's going to cost us a million bucks, bond issues, etc. So here we go again. I think again, indecision has cost us, doubled our price and wasted a lot of time. I suggested to the chamber of commerce a couple of years ago that we should
decide, then and there, which route we were going to take as far as air transport service in here is concerned. Are we going to continue to keep scheduled air carriers, regional air carriers in here, specifically Frontier, or are we going to get a good commuter service to hook up with other terminal points? We should decide to pursue
some approach. So they just kind of kicked it along. My 28

 DR. D. F . BE YE LER
theory is that the condition of the airport is inversely proportional to the closeness of the elections.
SG: You're probably right on that. So up to now they've just worked out short-term solutions. Has Frontier Airlines put pressure on to get this thing solved?
DB: Frontier has indicated that they would like to pull out but they want to leave the door open in case we get an influx of tourist traffic, say like Jackson Hole, so they can come back in. They have started another campaign now, shutting down our funds and so on. They don't really want to pull out if there's a chance of subsidies from a dollar-and-cents standpoint. This is a money loser without subsidy. If they can get subsidy, they don't mind flying in. They have had problems when they merged with Central. Some of those flatland pilots had some trouble learning to land in mountainous area. This was a problem, so they fussed a little. It was opportune at the time because they wanted to cut back some flights. They were running short of equipment on their good hauls, so naturally they wanted to cut out their non-paying flights. I can't blame them for this. They didn't tell us this but it was pretty obvious. This agitated me a little. If they had come to us and told us, you know, and
were frank with us, but they kind of put the monkey on one of the commissioners and said, "Keep it off our

field," and this agitated me a little. We're shifting around. I have no objections to them making money, you know.
It's a human instinct.
Yes, they have to make money. But when they turned around and then tried to put the monkey on our back, so to speak, I grew a little hostile with their public relations man, and we're still not too friendly.
Do they have a petition into CеAеBе now for discontinuance or a cutback of service?
They have a petition in to reduce the service. One of the fellows was up there the other day, and my impression was that he said there was an application on the desk to discontinue service. He kind of let this slip out, I think. Anyhow, I'm sure this is what he said. It's just sitting there, kind of waiting to see how the discontinuance goes. But I'm sure they will discontinue
it.
SG: Are there any other problems or areas that we haven't
gone into that you feel we should cover?
DB: That would be created by the road commission, you mean? SG: Well, just generally about Moab. You don't have to limit
it strictly to the commissioner job.
DB: Nothing too much. As far as the average commissioner or
taxpayer is concerned, these are the two issues: the 30

dissension in law enforcement and the airport. Oh, I can't think of anything. Of course, we're actively soliciting the dam up here in Mill Creek for the
recreational value of the town and flood control and so on. This is one of those things we've been working on for twenty years. Eventually, one day, we'll probably have it; every chance we get we explore the avenues till we
hit a big wall and have to start over again.
Is there any hope in the immediate future, in the next three to five years?
I would say so, yes. It looks as good as it ever has, but
we're still talking. These federal agencies now, they're delving into their three, five and seven-year plan. Of course priorities can be shuffled, but from a practical standpoint, I don't look for anything for three to five years at least.
Is there any problem with pollution in this valley? Oh, yes.
With water or air?
SG:
DB:
SG:
DB:
SG:
DB: Well, the biggest pollution in the valley, of course, is
the city dump, which has been in violation for three years now, I think. Mr. Holbrook, I think, was down and told us that variances would be given to rural counties where it wasn't really a problem. Then after the hearings and it was enacted, they said there would be no variances
31

 DR.
D. F . BEYELER
given to municipalities, and we were in violation, that we should conform. I asked him how long we had to conform, and he said probably a couple of years. So now I understand they're putting the heat on again. We've asked for variance because of our isolated area. I don't think we've got a health problem. From the general scheme of things, it looks bad. Occasionally we do, sure, but I don't think it's a real health hazard. Of course, the law was made primarily for the industrial areas on the
Wasatch Front. So I think it's just dependent on whether the Department of Health says we conform, we go to a sanitary land fill. No alternative. So I think it awaits a decision.
What is the primary reason for not just going ahead into a sanitary land fill?
Partly cost.
That's the main reason?
I think so. Probably eventually, we'll come to it anyhow in ten, fifteen years. We probably should take steps to do it, but elected public officials don't look too far ahead, you know.
About how much in terms of money would this be approximately?
SG:
DB: SG: DB:

DB: The Association of Counties has a series of brochures. I think I gave mine to one of the engineers or somebody.

 DR. D. F . BEYELER
Yes, you can compute costs like this. I don't know what they are, but the various method that are applicable here, you can compute so you can set these on a budget or
contract them, either way you want. It would be very easy
to compute the costs of this course.
SG: It wouldn't be anywhere near what the city airport
thing's going to cost. You're not talking about sums like
this, or are you?
DB: Oh no. I would say, off the top of my head, an increase
in your garbage collection cost of maybe about 10, 15 percent per person. The figure that sticks in my mind is about twenty-five thousand dollars a year. I don't remember where I acquired it, or whether it was computer on a population basis or what. We do have some problem here. We don't have a lot of surface dirt. Some of this might have to be hauled, and this might alter the cost. But this is very easy to computer. In fact, the county bought the dozer here three years ago which at that time I was greatly in favor of because I anticipated that we would have to use it part-time for this, and that it would be a joint city and county venture. I think now it probably be a city venture, and if there are county residents, then contract with them on an individual basis. I think it's mostly a city problem rather than a
county problem.
