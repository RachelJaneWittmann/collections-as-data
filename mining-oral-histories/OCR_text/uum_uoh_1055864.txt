 THE FOLLOWING I S AN INTERVIEW WITH ELBERT E . LEWIS CONDUCTED BY RICHARD GIBBS A T MR. L E W I S ' O F F I C E I N GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO ON JULY 30, 1970.
RG: Thank you very much for having me here today, sir. And I was wondering, Mr. Lewis, if you could give me a background on what you did before you entered the uranium industry and what you've done while you have been in the uranium industry?
EL: Well, I graduated from the Colorado School of Mines in 1942 with the degree of engineer of mining. Then from '42 to '46 during World War II. I was with the Corps of Engineers, and then returned to the Colorado School of Mines in 1947 and got a degree in
metallurgy. Following that I went to work for Saint Joseph Lead Company in Leadwood, Missouri as mine engineer and then as an assistant mill superintendent. I worked for Saint Joe from 1947 to 1951. I left Saint Joe's and then went to work in South America in Bolivia for a subsidiary company of the W.R. Grace mining tin and tungsten, principally tungsten. I worked for them for the years 1951 and 1952. In 1953, I went to work for Yucca Mining and Milling Company outside of Kingman, Arizona and the little town of Yucca, Arizona as assistant general manager. We were mining zinc and copper. Following that in 1953, I went to work for a time for the Manganese Company of Arizona mining manganese for the

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
government shipping program. And in about 1953, '54 I came to the Colorado Plateau actually looking for manganese, and ended up in Moab, Utah. Moved my
family to Moab, and started contract mining and leasing on these smaller uranium properties. I continued in that--well, have continued for some years, have continued ever since, in effect. I had a proprietary company for a time and then had a group of partners which we called E. E. Lewis and Associates which evolved in E. E. Lewis Incorporated. Then I continued mining uranium. About four years ago, about 1966 or thereabouts, why, we sold the company. At that time the stockholders were only employees with my wife and I being the principal stockholders, and Mr. Jack Piso (?) was the major stockholder. And then the small quantities of the stock which was sold, issued to employees at various times, Jack and I had bought some. Mr. Piso and I bought it all back. Along about 1966 or '67--I'm not sure which. I'd have to look up in my records here-- we had a stock-type merger with Beaver Mesa Uranium and we received Beaver Mesa Uranium stock and E. E. Lewis Incorporated became a wholely owned subsidiary of Beaver Mesa Uranium and that's its present status. We sold out all our uranium holdings just prior to
2

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
the merger with Beaver Mesa, so at the time we merged with Beaver Mesa we had mostly case, and that was in 1966. That was when we stopped mining uranium. Since that time we have not been actively mining uranium.
RG: You mentioned that in 1954 you moved to Moab. And I was wondering, what were you involved in then? Was it contracting?
EL: Well, in '53 I came up through Moab looking for manganese and I believe it was late in '54 that I moved my family up to Moab and was involved in contract mining, doing mining for various stock companies, stock promoters that needed to have a little money--a little mining done on their properties to show that they might have a little bit of ore. Not all of the properties had ore that we mines, and as a result we did a lot of it on a cost- plus basis. We do it at what ever costs we expended, plus a percentage of any profits that the property would show.
RG: Were you ever involved in any significant mining during this period? And any significant deposits?
EL: I also did a certain amount of consultant work being a graduate engineer and having been registered in Missouri. I hadn't yet registered in Colorado. I believe that when I was living in Missouri I had
3

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
gotten registration there. And I did consulting work and was involved in significant deposits in this connection; evaluations more than anything else. But
as far as--no, not mining any significant deposits during this time. It was all mining small mines. We did contract mining, or leaser-type arrangements with various companies. I did it with Continental-- actually the predecessors of Continental Materials, the people that sold their holdings to Continental MAterials down at the Rattlesnake Mine. I had done some mining for them down on the Green River. We had negotiations going on for the Rattlesnake Mine, but that was at the time that they were also negotiating with Mr. Gibbons (?) out of Chicago who eventually formed Consolidated Materials and made up that deposit. But we weren't involved in any major mines. We shipped a lot of ore, but all small near-surface deposits.
people. I had many hundreds of people going through, thousands of people, I suppose, exploring and one things and another. A lot of promoters; and I use the term here in its general connotation and not its denotation--carpetbaggers, or this type. They had big
Do you remember what Moab was like at this time?
RG:
EL: Well, Moab was physically much smaller. It had more
4

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
fancy cars, Cadillacs and so forth, to impress people. You'd go out to dinner with them and it ended up that they would get a telephone call and they would be called away just about the time the check arrived and you ended up paying for it. Everybody was--not everybody, but a lot of these groups were endeavoring to form penny stock companies, stock companies of any sort. They were not really
interested in whether or not they had any ore as much as they were in getting their hands on the money and so forth. There were a lot of genuine prospectors that were in the area, bearded and long haired before the present generation were wearing beards and long hair. Does that answer your question as to what Moab was like? As far as numbers of people, physically the town has changed. The Arches Cafe was a new building and Steen had a new building next to it. Steen was in the process of, I believe--I can't recall for sure whether he had completed or was still building his home overlooking Moab. Very difficult to find living quarters and so forth. My wife and I lived in a small house trailer with the two children that we had at that time. We had two children. We have five now, but we had two children at that time. That was the only living accommodations that we could find. In fact, we
5

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
left Moab. I took the family out of Moab along in September--and I believe it was September of '54--and had them live over here in Grand Junction. Although housing was tight over in Grand Junction, at least there was more of it and the school accommodations and so forth were better.
RG: Then in general, Moab had taken on the aspects of a boom town, would you say?
EL: Oh yes. Yes, of course. My feeling is that I lived through and got to see the greatest mineral boom the United States has ever had. From all I've read of it and studied some of the other booms, the gold booms, the Rush of '49 and so forth, they were all very small compared to this for various reasons. There was a lot more people involved in this uranium boom. It was a boom town. It had all of the things that the booms of the earlier years had so far as roughness and one thing and another, but it was bigger, so much bigger, and so much more involved because of modern transportation and communication. You couldn't get a telephone to make a long-distance call out of Moab. An hour or two to get to a phone. And if you were getting one--receiving a call in, why, it could be days to begin to get a line because they were just a l l t i e d u p . I t w a s m u c h b i g g e r . A nd i t w a s
6

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
absolutely a boom town, as it was, and it was more than a boom town, of course, it was a boom area. Moab, by circumstance, ended up as the heart of it, although as records have shown more of the ore was not in Grand County as it was in San Juan County. But
it just happened to have passed Monticello by because of geographic location, I guess, and communications to a certain extent.
RG: Uh ~uh. You mentioned that school facilities weren't the same or as good as Grand Junction. Do you recall what they were like?
EL: Well, they were very overcrowded, of course. They had not yet built the new schools that they have now in the north and north west part of the town. They were just very crowded, far overcrowded. My wife had been enquiring about various ones and had received nothing but derogatory things concerning the schools. Interesting things in town, of course, in connection with this stemmed from the fact that the Catholic Church up until that time had been a mission church. There were enough people there. The services, as I recall, were held over in the chapel of the mortuary. They didn't have their own building. That was built later on there. Of course, up to that time, why, Moab
being Moab and in Utah, and prior to that big boom 7

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
with outsiders coming in, why, there were few Catholics and fewer religions in the town represented outside of Mormons. They may still be in a minority, but at that time there were a lot of Catholics in the
area. I guess there's a goodly number left today that have stayed over there. But it was a new experience for the town, and there was no church. It was definitely a boom town with all the aspects of a boom town. Prostitution was illegal, but girls would set up in house trailers outside of town and readily mobile when the sheriff decided to move them on or otherwise. The liquor, of course, was available through the state store and not in any other way, although the beer and so forth was. This was probably the biggest difference between this boom and the '49, one thing and another. There were a few killings around Monticello, Moab. Probably more controlled, but I'm sure from what I read that it was a much larger boom and probably affected a larger area than any other booms had. I'm certain that there both more money and more people involved in this boom than there was in any of the gold rushes.
RG: What was life like in Moab on a Saturday night?
EL: Well, so far as my wife and I were concerned, because we didn't have much money--we had damn little money--
8

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
it was mostly involved with the drive-in theaters. But we had occasion to go downtown Saturday night. But I had lived around a lot of mining towns prior to Moab and I wouldn't say that it was any different than any other mining towns. In lots of ways less so that Silverton was. In 1938 I worked over there in Silverton and it was a lot more wide open and lot rougher town than Moab was. So I couldn't say that it was particularly unique, in my opinion, the Saturday night social life of Moab as a mining town.
RG: What were the services provided by the city like? Were they adequate? The police protection and things of that nature?
EL: Realize I was only there for a very few months as an actual resident in Moab, so I had no complaints. We lived in a trailer house out toward the edge of town. It has since then grown up considerably. I had no complaints and couldn't answer you question at all in this respect because, as I say, we lived there for a short time and then moved on up here to Grand Junction where you had rail transportation and main truck lines and so forth. But I don't particularly recall that prices were greatly inflated. In traveling around the area from Moab to Monticello and
the other towns that were off the beaten path, I am 9

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
sure that they were higher in Moab than in Grand Junction because I recall that groups of women would get together occasionally to come over to buy in Grand Junction and figured that they made a substantial savings. Whether this was entirely true,
I don't know. Whether they weren't just looking for a
change in social life too.
RG: What type of mining were you involved in actually,
this contractual mining?
EL: Well, we leased several properties. We leased from
various companies. Following that we leased from out in the so-called Four Corners area, south of Green River. We leased from the Four Corners Uranium Company. We leased from American LaDuc (?) up on Tenderfoot and outlaw. We leased from other small companies that had gotten started that had ore but not particularly the know-how to mine it. In some cases we moved in on ore bodies that we contracted or leased from Climax Uranium, different deposits that had been worked down, more or less worked out that we did in cleanup work. They were actually leases, they were not contracts. We were not guaranteed any amount of money for the work we did. This was just a strictly to develop the mine, or do the work that was necessary and pay the owner a percentage of the
10

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
return, and this was by far the biggest, I'd say by far. I'd say that more than half of our work was leases from other companies that had developed ore.
RG: How many people did you have working for you at this time?
EL: Well, when I first came up to the country from Arizona, why, I brought one fellow up from Arizona with me, and when we were working down there on the Green River we hired two fellows that I knew from Arizona, and the four of us was doing the mining. Eventually the top payroll I had in the mines was
about twenty-eight men plus three foremen at different properties, different locations. It varied all the way from--in other words, it varied from one man and myself on up to the top payroll which was about twenty-eight.
RG: Uh huh. Did you ever apply for a lease from one of the bigger companies such as Union Carbide?
EL: Why, when I say bigger companies, we had leases and did work for Climax, a lot of work for Climax and was probably one of their larger producers. We never was very successful with Union Carbide. Couldn't tell you exactly why. Probably personality conflicts with somebody along the way. We only had one small lease
with Union Carbide over the years and it was not very 11

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
profitable. A lot of people got rich with Union Carbide, but I wasn't fortunate to get one of their good properties.
RG: Did you ever apply for an A.E.C. lease?
EL: The A.E.C. leasing was pretty well out by the time-- by this period. I can't recall exactly the years that their leases were out. We had applications but they never had any more out to put out. We subleased from Ortmeyer (?) Mining Company which was one of those affairs that under A.E.C. regulations and government
contract, they could not sublease, but in essence, was a sublease called a contract. And it was treated by the Internal Revenue and treated by everybody involved as a lease because we paid for all the men, all the materials, all the labor, and all the exploration work. But it was not directly from the A.E.C., although we shipped a lot of ore under that contract also for the Ortmeyer(?) Mining Company.
to approve the contract, but it was a matter of the change in words calling it a contract. It was a short-term cancelable thing rather than the way a lease is a self-perpetuating for a stipulated time without cancellation without cause. You have to have
Did the A.E.C. ever investigate this or ever--?
RG:
EL: Oh, the A.E.C. was aware of it, and in fact, they had
12

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
cause for a cancellation of a lease, whereas on a contract like we had, it could have been terminated with far less cause than you would have to have under a lease. They never investigated. They knew what we were doing and knew that we were the operator and
respected us as the operator.
RG: Did you ever come in contact with the A.E.C. on any
other basis?
EL: Oh, I don't exactly understand your question.
RG: Well, did the A.E.C. ever inspect any of the
properties you worked? Did they inspect the
properties you contracted from Ortmeyer (?) ?
EL: Oh yes, we had relationships in several ways with the A.E.C. outside of just the fact that they looked at
our lease or contract that we had with Ortmeyer (?) Mining Company. As I say, I did consulting work, so I had occasion to get letters and permission to look at records of various properties that the A.E.C. had for clients. I had these relationships with them. They quite often inspected the mining procedure on the A.E.C. leases we had. We had a state mine inspector who would inspect so that we were following all the necessary state regulations and so forth. Then the Bureau of Mines also inspected the properties for the government. And then the A.E.C. mining and geological
13

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
personnel would periodically inspect the properties. We had good relations with the A.E.C. over all the years. We had more problems with some of the people
in the Bureau of Mines. They'd come in and make their inspection and would change things. The young mine inspector that inspected the Ortmeyer (?) property once, as I recall, came in and directed that the powder magazine be changed and relocated because it did not follow the standards. It was about thirty- five feet closer to a habitable building than it was supposed to be. The A.E.C. inspectors had looked at it for several years prior to this, and we ourselves--as a graduate mining engineer concerned with safety, I looked at it, and all the predecessors of this particular inspector had looked at it and had never found anything to complain about. But this was in the dying throes of the property along--I believe it was along about in 1962 when the A.E.C. program on these leases ended and that was when he insisted that the magazine be moved after the thing had been inspected probably for the previous eight, ten years by various inspectors. Lack of experience was all we could generously attribute his actions to. But we had good relations with lots of the inspectors through the area, both A. E. C. and Bureau of Mines on the
14

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
A.E.C. leases. The A.E.C. did visit all of the properties that we operated. They used to come in and get maps, get out records and so forth. They received
sufficient information to compile good data over the
years on the plateau, which I felt they did.
RG: You mentioned the Bureau of Mines. Now the A.E.C. is also involved on this. But were you ever required to put in fans for ventilation on any of these
properties?
EL: Of course, you have to have fans, generally speaking,
on a property for any type of mining property whether you' re in silver or whatever type of mining you' re in. And you have to provide ventilation because of smoke, blasting smoke. If you're using diesel equipment, you have to provide it for Diesel equipment, adequate ventilation to remove the gases et cetera. Yes, the A. E. C. had the air inspectors come around in which would use their pumps and make their counts. And yes, we had had to provide more ventilation than we were providing at different times. In several of the small operations we have had over the years, I know we exceeded the accepted norm of one working level by many times for short periods, but I don't think we ever exceeded it for long periods. Yes, we probably did have certain areas of
15

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
the mine that would be several time working level. Any health hazard--and I presume th is is the reference you' re making--was not recognized as particularly hazardous as to how many times working
level. There was not a well-established norm as to what--it was some years before this so-called working level was established. But even prior to that, yes, they came in, and if it was too high, you had to
increase the ventilation. We've had to do that, yes. RG: Do you have an opinion about the radon-daughter danger that seems to be so highly discussed today?
There's so much talk about it.
EL: An opinion as to the mines or an opinion as to what
they're talking about today? I think that's two
things here.
RG: Well, first of all, let's discuss the radon danger in
the mines.
EL: Well, I think it is self-evident from the number of
cancer cases that we have had that there is a danger. Whether there has been enough work done--I mean when this thing developed in this country, the only historical evidence was the work done in Belgium, and norms or standards were adapted from there and modified and one thing and another. And I'm not sure whether the standard of one working level or one-
16

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
tenth of a working level--and I'm not sure just what the current regulation is, how many fractional parts of the working level, I don't know that they do know. We do know that there is an absolute danger from it. This is self-evident. What the connection is with
smoking, and I think there probably is a connection, we don't know. The fact that the radiation-- apparently the daughter products, or the dust, centers on the nuclei of some sort and is gathered in, and the fact that men are smoking and miners tend to--a lot of miners would hold the cigarette right in their mouth until it was so short that they'd spit it
out rather try to take it out with their fingers. I'm sure this has an effect. But I'm not sure that we have a clear distinction between the danger--of what the level of danger is. The danger is there, yes. But whether our present standards are too stringent, I don't know. As a miner I am probably biased. I feel that they are overly stringent. Illustrative of the fact that they're overly stringent is the fact that you can go into many of the mines in the Central City area in Colorado, the Georgetown area in Colorado, portions of mines such as Climax Mine, a hard rock mine, and actually get radiation counts that are in excess of what has been set as the current mine
17

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
standard. And I suspect that this is too high because I know of no studies. The things that we've had over the years that the miners have died from was rock dust, which has been associated with silica, an entirely different thing than the cancerous growth such as you get from your radon. So I feel that we have erred on the side of being to conservative, the government has, but only time will prove. With the present philosophy and attitude throughout the country, and it's probably a good one, it's better to err on the side of safety than to err on the other side. I do feel, in precise answer to your question, I do feel at the present time they are too stringent. Some of the open-pit mines actually with air blowing through them or across the top on two or three sides, the actual radiation count is higher than is allowable in a mine. I can see no reason why people can't get cancerous growths from open pits. So maybe, as I say, we're erring on the side of safety. Now the other point of the question, I take it, or the other interpretation of the question is the matter of radiation in such things as the use of uranium in reactors, the reactionary actions of people at Platteville, Colorado, where they're putting in a
nuclear reactor. I believe that the standards adopted 18

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
and the laws that we have currently in force are adequate, and that we have got to utilize uranium energies. And I think it's foolish on the part of many of these groups to overreact, as they are overreacting, to the need for energy that we have in this country. I feel this is probably one of the better sources until we harness energy from the sun and electrical storms. This is probably far less detrimental to the environment than the use of coal and the wood, et cetera. We do have a tremendous
increase in need every year for more electrical energy and a limited amount of streams where we can get water energy. And again, within our current environmental studies and ecological things going on, these people are objecting to more dams for more power, for more electrical energy. If we're going to have it, I think we're going to have to utilize our resources, and I personally believe that the safeguards today are adequate if adequately enforced.
RG: One of the other dangers of radiation which has been recently brought up is the tailing from such mills as the Climax mill here in Grand Junction. What do you feel about the danger from these?
EL: Now are you specifically asking about this matter of the use of the tailings in basements and foundations
19

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
and buildings from the Climax tailings, or are you referring to the residual tailings piles that are at Rifle and Moab and various other points?
RG: Well, the tailings from the Climax piles that are being used in construction.
EL: I don't think there's any danger. I don't think there's any more danger than there was in the various superstitions which may have had some foundation in the fact that if a man was around high-grade uranium for a very short time, why, he would become sterile. I never put much stock in this. I had a belt buckle that had a big piece of uranium on it at that time, and I wore it for a good while. I was around and worked in high-grade mines there for some years and had three children following this, the last of which was only four years ago, so that if it worked, it didn't work on me. I feel the same in regards to tailings. The radiation level is so low that I believe there is no danger. It has been a great thing for the news media and has attracted a lot of attention. Many of our problems today, I feel is communications. It sells time on television, it gets television crews raises, it gets newspaper people
headlines as they're always wanted, and similar things. It's more newsworthy than it is anything
20

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
else. But the danger is not there.
RG: To go back to mining directly, what did you do after you quit leasing from Climax and the other companies? EL: Well, our last leasing was with Four Corners Uranium Company. Principally, our last leasing was in uranium. This was in 1966. The ore bodies we had were very marginal; they were low grade. It was difficult to get any ore bodies that were high grade enough to mine economically. The cost of labor had moved up considerably. It just wasn't profitable for us to continue in the type of leasing that we had done, and there were no leases available from Climax that were profitable. Most of the good mines Climax operated themselves, and that is why we were never successful
in getting in on any good leases with Union Carbide. In fact, we hadn't been successful on getting leasing with them. We did considerable underground construction work after that. We did work for the Bureau of Reclamation. We put in the Ute Water Tunnel
up here for the Ute Water Conservation District. We've done contract work for Kennecott and U.S. Mining and are still doing contract work and general mine consulting. But the uranium, the price--this was at the end of the allocation program and pricing had changed. What hadn't changed was due to change, and
21

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
we had a chance to sell out at what was a good profit to us in 1966 to Atlas, and we sold that lease to Atlas. Mined gilsonite and various other commodities
since then where the price was better compared with the--well, the price was just better for the labor for what we had to put out. We just made more money on it.
RG: During this entire period, did you ever stake any claims of your own?
EL: Very, very few. Very, very few. Very few claims of my own and none of them ever turned out. I've always thought of myself as an operator, and I failed to recognize the opportunity that was existed from the time I first arrived up until 1960 or so in just staking claims and selling them, even though they were worthless. As a mining engineer and having a geological background, I looked at a lot of this stuff with a very jaundiced eye and didn't consider it worth staking, although other people came along and staked it and sold it for good sums. None of us have the ability to look at all of it that has ore, so some that would have been available for staking,
we never staked. A lot of people that have staked ground let it go two or three times. The present Rio Tinto ore body that's near La Sal in the Big Indian
22

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
area had been staked two or three times previous to the staking by the current group who leased it to Rio Tinto and who are now sinking a shaft preparatory to mining it and will be mining in 1972. But that ground had been staked by several different companies as well as individuals and had been let go over time. The ore is deep. That ore is in the twenty-two to twenty-four hundred-foot depth. In the old days, anything over two or three hundred feet was deep ore. And then it got up to about nine hundred feet deep
ore. And now they're drilling down to thirty-six hundred feet for it. It would be next to impossible to come up and make a stake in the uranium business as I was able to do, make some money in the uranium business today because the ore is deep. At that time you could go in and start from near surface ore. This is the difference in labor costs and so forth that I mentioned to you. It's the fact that you're got, not only the labor costs, but material costs, more pumping of water and air and so forth that today is not profitable for a little man to be going after like it was when I first came here. But I never did stake any claims.
RG: In the near future, it seems as if the Atomic Energy Commission is going to release the lands that they
23

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
withdrew during the earlier periods. If possible, would you try to get a new lease?
EL: Oh yes, very definitely. Very definitely.
RG: What do you think of the possibilities of the small miners and the independents outbidding Union Carbide
EL:
and these other large companies for the areas?
I don't know how this is going to come about. This is going to be political as much as anything. And I'm not so sure that the ore bodies will be released in the next--well, let's say in the foreseeable future of two to five years. I think this thing, if it's released, will be done rapidly. There have been numerous meetings as to how it will be, and as far as the federal government is concerned, and I may be
wrong in this, but I believe you'll find that historically on the federal leases of this type where there are numerous people wanting them, it had been normally handled in a lottery proposition and not as bidding proposition. Now this is not true of your states, Indian agencies, and other particular agencies. And I presume that the A.E.C. can take the position that they are an agency such as the Indian agency and as having a fiduciary relation to the people, different than the other agencies of the government that they could recoup their costs and one
24

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
thing and another, and thereby take a bid. It would be difficult. I'm not even sure that Union Carbide would be successful in getting all the ore bodies they would like to acquire under such a system. Many of the big oil companies with more money at their disposal and desirous of getting their foot in the
door on a sound basis could it and would it outbid them on a straight bidding proposition. Recent meetings of the Independents Organization and the A.E.C. have indicated that there must be a more equitable way for the small mine and that there probably will be a lottery system. And a lottery system. And this, of course, would definitely want to be in on. We would definitely want to contact those that are successful in the lottery that may not be in the mining business. We not only have the education-- our mining engineer is a graduate and registered--but we've had a great number of year in physically mining for uranium and feel that we can do a good job and would come well recommended. But this is going to be political in my opinion. And once it gets on the floors of Congress with the hue and cry of pollution of the air and why bring out more uranium to build
more bombs to let more radiation into the air, why, it's very, very possible, if not probably, that it
25

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
could be a long time before the government would release it. And if they was to release it in a bidding manner and Union Carbide ended up with most of it, I'm afraid we'd end up with another Teapot- Dome Scandal type of thing in which, if it was true
or not true, the A. E. C. would be accused of having loaded it in such a way that Union Carbide is the principal beneficiary of it. I believe that because the A.E.C. has to protect themselves and the Congressional Atomic Cammittee has to protect the public, they will endeavor--now whether they will or not--I think they will endeavor to devise some type of system that Union Carbide does not end up with all of it or most of it. Now unfortunately, there's no other mills in the area. They may end up with most or all of the yellow cake unless it is devised in such a way that there was some competition for them. And again, except in the uranium field because of the nature of the circulars and the program, the government pays transportation on the ore. This has become more or less a customary thing that the mills pay a portion of the transportation. Well, we're all kidding ourselves. The ore itself has to bear the cost. Whether it's transportation--well, it has to be transportation, mining, and milling and everything

that goes into it. And for this reason, the principal ore bodies that the A.E.C. have proved or semi-proven and their best areas, the competition for this ore that Atlas might provide would be negligible because of the economics involved in hauling it over there. The recipient, the only mill that will be able to handle that ore will be Union Carbide unless there is a new mill in the area. But in direct answer to your question, I would be very interested in bidding and continuing in the uranium business, and if possible, the mining business.
RG: I have just a couple more questions. Just to go back a ways, one of the large complaints from the independent miners, the small miners on the Colorado Plateau has concerned the ore sampling of the mills. Many of the miners have claimed that they were cheated by the mills. I was wondering, have you ever had any contact with this situation, or any opinions on it?
EL: I've worked in the milling business, and I have a degree in metallurgy and milling. And every mill is accused of being a thief and a crook and stealing the ore. I don't care if it's uranium or if you start a survey through the silver and gold area, wherever there are custom m ills, why, the m ills are thieves. I

think the program was very wel1 monitored by the A.E.C. I am sure there were errors made. As far as the complaints, yes, at various times we have had complaints. We have also had all of our ore assayed on our own, and when we had discrepancies with mill, we went to umpire. We won a lot of the umpires. We
lost a few. I'd say we won more than we lost. But I think that we had a better system in that I had more trained personnel as a small company than most of your small miners. I had three graduate engineers including myself on the staff and we handled this thing entirely different. We made radio-metric analysis of all our own shipments, of all of the pulps that came back from the mills, and we assayed those that looked like they might be out of line. So as a result we were in a position to win more umpires than we lost. And we did win more than we lost. But also by the same token there were many, many examples that we never sent to umpire, many samples that we
had assayed that appeared to us that we were far ahead of the mill. And a lot of shipping that we did from the Ortmeyer property, we shipped there down to the Union Carbide mill at that time down at Slick Rock, and on many thousands of tons we were absolutely convinced that we were way ahead of them

in assays. They were not giving us the benefit of the doubt, but in some way we were actually getting ahead of them in the way we were loading out trucks. The biggest complaint, and probably a justifiable complain because it is more difficult to prove any time you're shipping ore, is in the moisture sample rather than in the assay. The difference of a few percent in the amount of moisture over the thousands and thousands of tons that were corning into these various mills gave the mill all the edge it needed; they didn't have to be dishonest in their sampling procedure on assaying. They just failed to take their moisture sample or to cover their moisture sample fast enough so that it dried out; or in taking their moisture sample, they took more of the big pieces than they did the small pieces, and the moisture sample is not taken by an automatic sampler. You had the privilege at all the mills to follow your ore through and to check the samplers. And I agree that the uranium ore producers were instrumental in getting the Colorado School of Mines Research Foundation in here to correct some of the procedures in the sampling, but the procedures they corrected
were on ore sampling. There was never any correction made in moisture sampling. If there was a wholesale
29

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
discrepancy, I feel that this was probably in the moisture sample. It was not as a matter of dishonesty on the part of any of the mills of Union Carbide or Climax because there would have to be too many people
involved. They couldn't do it under company directives to tell the assayer to be dishonest in the thing. You may direct the assayer that the lower average of three samples is what is reported. The same way is when we go to umpire, we go to umpire claiming the higher average of the samples that we've had assayed, and it's up to the umpire to decide where it is. And by the nature of the contract, you're paid either on the umpire, or if the umpire falls outside of the limits of either one of the samples, why, then you're paid on the sample that is closest to his. But, we would go to the umpire wit the higher sample. But there's things to be desired, no doubt. There was things to be desired especially
in the earlier days in the sampling. But in the moisture sampling, this was the big one, and it's a hard one to prove or disprove. And I think most of the allegations that you heard have had to do with the ore sampling and the assaying and not on the moisture side. But the moisture side is the place where it's real easy to gain thousands and thousands

 ELBERT E.LEWIS #1
of dollars because of the pounds of material coming in, and nobody can prove it, and there's no way of umpiring it, and you're not provided with a moisture sample. And if you were, it would be meaningless because the moisture from the time it's mined does
change from underground to the stockpile, to the truck, and on the truck en route to the mill. And after it gets to the mill, there's the toughest sample to take in milling, in mining. And I"m sure that there's bid discrepancies here, and this is the area that if there was anything crooked about it, it was here. We do recognize that the Colorado School of Mines Research Foundation after the U. O. P.A. , the Uranium Ore Producers Association, it's called, which was mostly the small companies, did successfully get a study made of the sampling procedures and get them changed and improved. But on the moisture side, there have been very little changes in the way a sample is taken today than when they first started shipping it up in this country.
RG: Okay, I don't believe I have any more questions to ask at this time. Is there anything else you would like to add that you think I haven't asked?
EL: Nothing that I have. I'm sure from all the interviews that you're taking, you'll get it someplace.

RG: Okay. Thank you very much, Mr. Lewis. EL: You bet. Thank you.
