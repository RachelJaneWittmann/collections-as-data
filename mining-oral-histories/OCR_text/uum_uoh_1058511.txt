 I'M INTERVIEWING L.B. WRIGHT, ADMINISTRATOR OF CHAPMAN HARBOR CONVALESCENT HOSPIT AL, GARDEN GROVE, CALIFORNIA, AUGUST 29, 1970, AT 2:00 P.M. THE INTERVIEWER IS PATRICIA RA Y . [ T H I S I S P ART OF THE UTAH URANIUM ORAL HISTOR Y PROJECT. TAPE #1.]
PR: Mr. Wright, where are you from originally?
LW: Utah.
PR: Uh huh. And what prompted you or brought you into the
uranium industry?
LW: Oh, I was born and raised in the field. That's where
the uranium was.
PR: Oh, you were. Were your parents both connected with
this?
LW: Yeah, uh huh.
PR: Was your father a prospector?
LW: Well, yes, in the early days, most of the time, yeah.
We owned several uranium mines.
PR: Did you develop them fully?
LW: Oh yeah. To the best of our ability anyway.
PR: Uh huh. And when you got older did you prospect on
your own or were you connected with---?---?
LW: No, I was independent all of the time. Always an independent miner. We sold our product to Union Carbide, and--see, actually we had a market back in 1921 and '22. We were mining on Polar Mesa and I was just a youngster and I carried mail up there on horseback. In the wintertime they had just a small crew but they were shipping their ore to the railroad

 L.B. WRIGHT #1
tracks which was about fifty-six miles. They would ship that ore out there, it was all high grade uranium, that's all it was at that time and they were selling it to--or mining it for--and they owned Polar Mesa at this time. It was one of the first discoveries in the uranium business. This ore was being shipped I understand on over to Germany to Madame curie for experimental [usesJ and she's the one that found from this ore, the first to discover radium, you know. That was the first start of it and then this kind of died off for several years. Actually my brother and another man and myself had-- -?--- quit mining so he was all up for staking, you know, for our own. We had staked in 1924-25 and times were so rough at that time we just couldn't keep up the assessment work. You had to do so much a year in order to hold the claim you know. So we just let them go. Along about 1937 they got a lease just for the vanadium at that time. Of course they're both containing vanadium and uranium, but at that time uranium was a by-product. So he mined, my brother and I mined some out in the valley and sold to some
people, Prestone, shipping it back, and we were just selling it for uranium. Of course they were paying us for vanadium too because they found it was very good

in hardening of steel. And you know in the steel industry they still use it very much. Then all during the war we ---?--- set-up in '39 to bind customs through the mail. We were shipping ore to my brothers and myself---?--- business mined in our own mines. We had several mines staked and we were mining just vanadium. We had a real good vanadium mine and we shipped our ore to Uravan which is about sixty miles away, trucking it. We mined there until '40. We eventually went into our own mines, but about '43-- let's see, '44, the government stopped buying. There was no more buying. They set up a program for the government to buy during this period and so we were only getting paid for the vanadium at that time. Then they quit buying so things lay dormant until about 1947 [when] they started in again, the boom started in uranium. Of course the ore that was shipped to the mill at that time that we mined--I was one of the largest independent producers in the
business--was used to make atomic bombs for--that's when they made the first atomic bombs from uranium, you know. Our ore was used; they recovered it, they took and remilled it and recovered it. We went along then and shipped our ore to--when they started paying uranium I guess in about '48 to '49, sometime along

 L.B. WRIGHT #1
in there. Then in '51 we got a good price so that we could afford the mine. From then on it just blossomed into a big industry. Uranium corporations came into the area. So that's just about it.
PR: Uh huh. Well when you sold the vanadium to the companies; to the mills, was it shipped directly to them or was it processed first? You know how--
LW: Oh yes, they had their mills processing in the area. They set up the Vanadium Corporation of America and United States Vanadium was the only true subsidiary of Union Carbide. They were the only two in the area buying at that time up until about--oh gee, I'd say
'51 to 1 52. Then the Atomic Energy came in and they set up a buying station here and there. One in Monticello, Utah, and they had one over in--they were buying down in Shiprock, New Mexico. Then Union Carbide or Vanadium Corporation [of America] set up another mill in Durango, one in Uravan, and so they
got them all over.
PR: Uh huh. Have you ever visited any of the offices of
the large corporations that were connected with the
vanadium-uranium business?
LW: Oh yes. I did very direct business with them, I sold
my ore to them. We were very good friends. We were all--as á a matter of fact they come out---?--- deals

 L.B. WRIGHT #1
in the uranium business and vanadium and some of them worked right with me.
PR: Uh huh. Did you do your own prospecting then first? LW: Oh yeah.
PR: What were some of the methods that you used to
discover--?
LW: Well at that time we were just using surface methods.
We had nothing to detect uranium with you know until along about--I don't know w~at year. Bob O'Connors and I. He made the first--he was a very good friend of ours. He made the first detector for uranium. That was perfected and--let's see, that was about '46,
'47, that's when they fist started finding where or that we had uranium.
PR: Uh huh.
LW: There was no way you could find it because you
couldn't see below the surface, and we thought at that time when it pinched out ---?--- maybe in a cliff, you know, there'd be a vein. We mined that until it pinched out and we thought that was the end of it. Well, most of the big mines after we had left, and as a matter of fact three or four that we had mined turned out to be the biggest mines in the industry because they drilled deeper into the hill
and found this, way back on the flats and they found 5

 L.B. WRIGHT #1
these big deposits that we had no way of knowing
[about].
PR: You mined most of the trees out?
LW: That's right.
PR: Uh huh, what--?
LW: We were mostly in the Morrison formation, the
Shinarump was where the biggest deposits have been found and the one below that too [Moenkopi] but the Morrison formation at our time was the only one exposed that we were able to--and that was vanadium, we were mostly after vanadium in those days.
PR: Were you in the industry when you began prospecting with airplanes?
LW: Oh yeah.
PR: You were. Did you ever do any actual marking when
prospecting from the air?
LW: Oh yes, we bought a claim, I was president of a
corporation, a small corporation, we bought some claims over in the Corey area then ---?--- but we prospected that by air and got real good scouts so we went into the area. It had already been staked so we just bought the claim. It turned out pretty good, we made some money on i t .
PR: Oh! When you shipped your ore to the mills what had to be the count for you to get paid?

 L . LW: PR:

WRIGHT # 1
Ten hundredths.
Ten hundredths and did you do the process of blending?
Oh yes, quite a bit. Where you have this vein you more or less want to get rid of the low grade ore so we'd blend in order to do this---?--- grade as well as ---?--- grade. Actually you couldn't make any money on it unless it was certain hundredths because
---?---
Uh huh. Have you worked in mines below the surface? Most of it was below surface.
You are aware, I know, of the fact of great illnesses that occur from uranium mining.
Well I haven't had this problem. I had a problem before we even went there. We were mining in the early days and we had a claim over here, ---?--- my brother in Nevada, and we were mining dry. We both picked up silicosis real bad. So that's the fact with me, but I don't think that the uranium had been a factor at all.
PR: LW: PR:
LW:
PR: Oh, I see.
LW: I had a very rich mine too. I had one of the richest
mines in the---?--- the carnotite mine. I took ore
out of there that was 50/50%.
PR: Oh my! Do you still own partial interest in this
7

 L.B. WRIGHT #1 claim?
LW: No, I've given up everything you know. I moved from there in '59 and let it go. We had no patent on claims. Like I say, in order to keep a claim you have to go and do your assessment work.
PR: How are some of the methods you used in assessment work to keep it up?
LW: Oh, build roads and do some drifting you know.
PR: Uh huh. It's $100 a year.
LW: Yeah, that's the requirement.
PR: Would this also cover any drilling that you would do? LW: Oh yeah, you could do about---?--- anything anyway.
---?--- even spend time prospecting on it would be considered as part of the assessment. It used to be that you had to make a ten by ten cut, ten feet deep by ten feet wide in order to do ---?--- That was discovery you know, but you don't even have to do that now ---?--- on one claim you see they do, and then the balance can tie in you know after you've stated twenty claims in this area. The claim, 100 by 600 feet.
PR: Did you have this measured off or did you step it off?
LW: Step it off until if you wanted to have it patented or---?--- discovery. Then a lot of times we'd call
8

 L .

WRIGHT # 1
in a surveyor and have it measured. ---?---.
Did you ever have any trouble with the claim jumpers? No.
You didn't? I understand that sometimes you would step them off so that they could be coming in and having them surveyed; stake a claim on over.
Wel1, they could, yeah. If you're over. We always tried not to do that. We'd understep our claims in order to cover everything and not to into the next claim, you know. It's a just a matter of getting them recorded and establishing carnotite.
And where did you record them at?
The county seat.
The county seat. Uh huh. Did you have quite a few claims in this area?
PR: LW: PR:
LW:
PR: LW: PR:
LW: Oh, not too many. We had---?--- from--like I said, I spent more tim e---?--- that mine was m ostly---?--- discoveries.
PR: What was the usual method of dividing up the properties?
LW: Well, usually we would--well, most all of the time you would have a---?--- royalties. Say we'd mostly- --?--- ten percent of royalties. Then it was raised fifteen, twenty percent during the boom and we'd have the man withhold the royalty and send it to the claim

owner.
Oh, I see.
Where we shipped ore.
Fine. Were you involved in the Union Carbide vs.--- ?--- suit?
Yes.
You were. Would you care to define that to us?
Oh, I don't know much about it. I just know that my part of it was pretty good. I came out pretty good on it. The way we---?--- done by they paid us per pound on the amount of ore that we had shipped at a certain price that they'd finally sell it. By doing this it cost us income tax, had it been we wouldn't have had to pay the income tax.
I understand that Mayor Alioto~-
Right.
--was one of the miners involved in it.
He was head of it. It was his firm.
I see. And were you connected with the committee of mine superintendents; mine owners?
Well we just formed what we called a co-op corporation, you know, a cooperation of small miners and they in turn had a president and a vice
president. We'd have our meetings and we'd pay our dues and we were using ---?--- for this type of

things; to get better prices from the government and from the mills and try to get better assaying methods. This was a national ---?--- started by Currin in 1948 and finally we got---?--- in '59. It was '62 when we finally got our own case. That many years.
A very long time.
But we had several, two or three trials and they were all defeats until Mayor Alioto took over.
How many people worked on suits?
I don't know exactly. There were twenty-seven or thirty-six original and Dad and myself and one of my brothers you know. There were a lot of them that didn't even join because they didn't think anything would ever come of it, you know. So they benefited-- -?--- anyway but---?---.
PR: LW:
PR: LW:
PR: Originally this was the committee that was---?---. You said that there were other benefits by belonging to the committee?
LW: Well I think by our getting better assaying methods we did. I don't really believe that by this type of thing you can do anything when it comes to fighting large corporations. I think they're going to have the say so anyway. I remember one time when I was shipping ore out of this one high grade mine and I
11

 L .
B .
WRIGHT # 1
wasn't satisfied with the assays I was getting back so I had a friend out there---?--- and we'd take in
identical 12 x 14 ton loads you know---?--- and so I asked him to run it through and come back and run it again you know. It ran--for instance, I think I was running around 50 to 60 hundreds percent in uranium and this particular load came out of the binful and it went to something like I think 251 uranium. The next load they ran back with 7O something, so it proves that they used methods that were pretty---?--
Now the big companies could afford to cut in their--which we should have done is put in our own mixing device right at the mine. the---?--- so there would be no chance of not getting a fair assay.
PR: Uh huh. Did you have an independent representative at the mill at all times?
LW: PR: LW:
We tried that, it didn't work.
Why wouldn't it work?
Well, because they had it set so that they could--the sampling machine is the one that was the gyp. It was nothing to do with the method. There's a way that that sampling machine will take a sample and where
your values lay. Your values could be in the coarse or in the fine. The sampler was set up to take the coarse and if the coarse was the low grade--
12

 L . PR: LW:
B .
WRIGHT # 1
You get a low count.
So this was--then it could be in the way they ground it up, or Dad always said that because of the method they used in drawing. [They'd] draw this uranium in very large--before it's processed has a tendency to build, but if there's any kind of air there it will bring the uranium right out of the dirt. Right out of the soil. The uranium doesn't penetrate. It adheres to it. That is in the Morrison formation. In the Shinarump it's altogether different. In the Shinarump the values are pregnated right into material.
Uh huh. So the use of a sand or something like this would--
Throw off the balance.
You've heard that some dealings were made with the--? I think now that they have it set up pretty fair. I don't believe how they got away with it as many years as they did I don't know. They always thought they were square but I know they weren't. I just know the difference between the---?---
PR:
LW: PR: LW:
PR: Was there a government regulation on this?
LW: They tried and they tried but they couldn't control
it.
PR: Well, the government officials that they would send
out, were they qualified men? 13

 L. B. WRIGHT #1
LW: They were engineers, yes. I would say yes.
PR: They did know about uranium?
LW: They know about--not very good miners.
PR: Oh! (laughter)
LW: They know what they know out of a book. They---?---. PR: Now that we've set up at Uravan, had you ever visited
that mill, ---?---?
LW: Oh yes, several times. One of my very best friends
is the superintendent of it. I was actually there when they built the thing. Of course they moved up Rifle you know. It used to be in Rifle and they moved it clear back in the early '3Os. They mined over there, paid their miners between half a day---?--- yourself.
PR: Oh my!
LW: I hired help during the war. That's all I could pay
was $3.50, $4.00 ---?---. I was back---?--- I hired
mostly Navajos.
PR: Did they seem to have a good sense of work?
LW: Navajos are good help, yeah. They're not very
dependable. They get paid and go to town and get drunk and you have to wait until they sober up to get them out of jail. [They] used to call me up in the morning and tell me they had my Navajos in jail, let them sit overnight and pick them up and take them to
14

 L . B . WRIGHT # 1 the mine.
PR: Did you mine on Navajo Reservation?
LW: Yeah, some. Yes, I mined out of Shiprock.
PR: Were there any regulations as to any procedure you
had to go through?
LW: No. No, the only thing that we had to have was a
Navajo had to own the property and you'd mine for him and take in the royalties. Then you had to pay the Navajo part of the royalties, it was split.
PR: And that was pre-set royalties before you would go into mining?
LW: Oh yeah. During the boom they did set up a deal where you had to pass the council in order to get a mine. You'd actually bid on it you know.
PR: You didn't bid on the properties?
LW: No.
PR: You just bid on the mining rights.
LW: That's all, they could kick you off anytime.
PR: Did quite a few of the independent miners go into
mining for the big corporation?
LW: Yes, the big corporations---?--- oh, quite a ways--
-?--- they didn't do much mining themselves, they leased it out or they had it on contract to the independent [miners] and they would actually---?---
drill in ore, you know and turn over a claim to them. 15

 L .
B .
WRIGHT # 1
Then we'd mine it at so much a pound. Then quite a few of the independent miners went into that and they still do, like---?--- I don't think the corporations ---?--- except in this deep mining. Now there it's
impossible you know for independent [miners] to do that because they're going down now 2,000 feet into the mines. Down in New Mexico especially, around Farmington and that area of Gallup, I mean, and they're going way too deep. But up there around the Colorado Plateau they worked all of that with contracting mines during the boom. Up before that they hired all their own crew.
PR: Do you think that the prices of mines have changed a great deal since you first got into the industry?
LW: Oh yes, yes. They're a lot safer, ventilation, having an inspector come in, of course ventilation in the mines, and water and this and that making it much safer for a miner.
PR: It used to be I understand that it was very comfortable all year long in the mines. Has the advent of ventilation changed the comfort?
LW: When you get that deep it does, yeah, and then the company ventilation. When we were first mining you know we were on the surface pretty close and we never
go very deep so we had no worry about that air. 16

 L . B . WRIGHT # 1
PR: Just bare piping right from the outside and then the
temperature was to be--
LW: Oh we put fans inside of the mine to draw the air in,
pump the old air out or vice versa ---?--- area depends on whether you have any opening in the--a lot of times when it wasn't too far to the surface we ran a---?--- out you know and get a---?---
PR: What is that?
LW: Well, we'd go out to the surface straight up that
raise from the tunnel ---?--- working level the ventilation---?--- drill---?--- a lot of them 12, 15, 24 inch vent holes, you know, they bring in a big drill and drill a hole.
PR: Then is it quite safe now for the miners to mine uranium?
LW: Why it's just as safe, we had very few casualties in the mines. My brother was killed in a mine. He had a rock fall on him. Mines as safe as ---?--- we had very few casualties in uranium mines. We've had a lot
more in coal mines where you have to worry about
gases and things like that.
PR: Have some of your tools changed quite a bit?
LW: Oh yes ---?--- much improved, our ---?--- drilling
equipment we used like we---?--- jackhammer and then they came along with a jack lathe that does all the
17

 L . B . WRIGHT # 1
work for you. So they developed that and developed-- -?---. They used to have steamers you know working in hard rock.
PR: What's that? I'm not familiar with it.
LW:
It's the same method except they put the steamer on a bar and then you would--see, it takes about an hour to set up, just to get to drilling. This way you just drive your hammer in and go to drilling. ---?--- speeded up the process. But they still use the stokers and such as that in hard rock, in big mines. If you ---?--- stoker ---?--- what it is is the hammer's built right straight up and down on the lathe and you regulate it with a valve, your air pressure there, and it pushes the hammer up you know to drill. As you drill you just keep raising that, with your water the same way, and drill right on through.
PR: Will the water freeze in the mines now when the winter comes?
LW: Depends on your ventilation. Usually not, but if you leave water, say right under a raise with the air coming through it will freeze up.
PR: Did you have to pack out in the beginning most of your ore on mules?
LW: Yeah, in the early days when I was first there---?-- 18

 L.B. WRIGHT #1
- we'd pack on mules. Most of them were wagons you know, a wagon and four horses, but they did pack ore.
PR: Now they have trucks and heavy equipment for it.
LW: Yeah, they built good roads then, even during the war they built a good road up to Polar Mesa. That was a
big discovery. If we'd have held onto that my folks and I and my brother-in-law would be wealthy. It was one of the greatest discoveries.
PR: Well, part of your problem you had so many highs and lows and---?--- it's difficult to keep mines without thinking that particular--
LW: Well, I don't know what the price is, I haven't been active since '59 you know. I don't know what they're doing. I know my brothers all had to get out of the business because they just couldn't compete.
PR: They were independent miners also?
LW: Yes. Yeah, they were mining up in Nevada. I don't
know, at Quicksilver. That's way [different] from
uranium.
PR: In what way?
LW: Well, it's just dangerous. See, they ---?--- right there---?---. They don't use all precautions.
PR: And they're still independent miners?
LW: Yeah. Two of them, then I have a brother in Colorado
that's superintendent of a silver mine. Silver and 19

 L.B. WRIGHT #1 gold.
PR: Your whole family then is connected with mines.
LW: Well, we were born right in the area you know right in the mine. You'll find 90% of the people who are in that area were miners, especially during the uranium boom it made them miners because during the Depression you know it was hard to make a living. We
did pretty well with what little bit we were getting.
We wonder how we did it, but we did it.
PR: (chuckle) Was it very hard for you to work for this? LW: Oh, ---?--- when your eight hours are up or twelve or
whatever time you're putting in, and when you have a crew, when you're paying and you work you work twelve hours. You work hard.
PR: What is the size of an average crew?
LW: Oh from four to six men all the time. That's about
all that I ever had.
PR: You had--was this every single mine that you had,
every single claim?
LW: About that, uh uh. After you get it going good I
usually take in one or two men with me and open it up you know. Then--well, if we had two or three of them we had them drill out ahead of time so we knew where we were going. So we set up to mine ---?--- but usually during the early days if we ran into a nice
20

 L .
B .
WRIGHT # 1
high grade there we'd increase a little bit you know. Otherwise we'd mine it very carefully. You had to mine it carefully just almost high grade in order to make them run anyway, you know. A lot of times the vein won't average over six or eight inches, so we had to mine a lot of them out to make them pay.
PR: Was there revenue available to supply or to finance?
LW:
Y es---?--- we had no problems getting that. But then I understand now they're having a heck of a time because--well, you know, they go on compensation and make more money than they can mining anyway, probably spoiled them. But then the health part of it too. I guess they have discovered that it is unhealthy, but I don't see how. I really don't. ---?--- Utah went to the University of Utah about three years ago to their clinic there and they couldn't find anything. After that I was supposed to have qualified, that's what I went for to see if I did, he said no. So other than
that I've been doing real well since then. ---?--- PR: Oh really?
LW: I'm taking blood every six weeks, one doctor---?--- Salt Lake and he asked---?---. So they were running an experiment at the same time on uranium mines and because of my---?--- they ran tests on me. But I get radium treatments all the time now because of my
21

 L . B . WRIGHT # 1
lungs and conditions they're in.
PR: I imagine in a few years they'll be able to come up with some conclusive proof one way or the other.
LW: Yes. I don't think it's any more unhealthy than
anything else; it's just up to the individual how healthy he is because lack of ventilation is the only thing that could be unhealthy, and I know that's what it is with me.
PR: You weren't aware of the ventilation problem at the time you were working?
LW: Well, we probably might have been aware of it, we didn't care. See, we were after money so we just kept going, going with the urgency. Now it's taken its toll. But I don't think it had anything to do with uranium being unhealthy. It was the dust we were getting in our lungs and you can't get out. Once silicone gets settled in your lungs, it's just there to stay.
PR: And now that you have certain health precautions it's probably good for you.
LW: Well, we did have them, but we didn't take them, you know, because like I said they didn't enforce us to ventilate our mines. Now they do, they have these state inspectors come out and they shut it down if
you don't ventilate your mine. Well, we didn't do it. 22

WRIGHT # 1
You had very little actually. You might have had laws but very little regulation.
It takes pretty good mining you know to afford to do the things that they request, so it's the little man out of business. If like I say you go and mine for the big companies contracting, contract and the big companies will come in and ventilate the mines. Contracting, so it's a much more healthy situation mining for the big company than it was being
independent except that the ---?--- was all gone because you don't have much chance to make much money. When a person's in business for himself he likes to work.
Do you think the miners were a very independent group of people?
Oh yes, the ones that were independent miners were. They took a lot of pride in the fact that they were doing it themselves?
Oh yes. Yes. Even right now there's a lot of money to be made in the mines. I don't say uranium, but gold mining has always been good you know. It takes somebody, a depression might bring it on, but right now like I say you don't have to go working in the mill. Stay in town and make a living. If they don't make it working the state's gonna hand it out to them

or the government--go on welfare. But during the early days we didn't have welfare or anything like that so we had to make a living. That was one of the very good ways to make it. Profit mining, a lot of guys made good out here just with the pans in the creek beds you know, but they don't do it anymore because it's work, that's exertion you know. They don't have to.
Did you enjoy your years of mining?
PR:
LW: Yes I did really. I---?--- back through the mines--
PR: LW:
-?--- in '44 went into seabees in the Navy. And then in 1 45 first of the year the war was over you know and so I came home and went into business in San Diego. They started finding uranium--see, we hadn't gotten paid for uranium at that time. It was only
during the war days mining, but we did very well--- ?--- and so when I went back to the mines the high altitude just kept me getting worse all the time until I finally just had to get out.
Do you think there's a lot of uranium left?
Like I say I've lost all contract with it. It's going to be very deep if there is in that area. Now there
might be deposits you know that haven't ever been discovered in other states in different formations, but so far there have only been a couple or three
24

 L .
B .
WRIGHT # 1
formations (where] that's been discovered you know. Some in the--mostly in the Shinarump and the Morrison have been the biggest discoveries and a very few mines in the Mesa Verde been any good because that's to late an area for the uranium to really develop, you know. It takes so much chemical and so many years for these claims to--light years to develop.
Did you have any background in geology?
No.
You're a self-taught miner.
Just a miner.
Uh huh.
Mining told us---?--- stop and go find another mine. Your father made mention of the fact that everyone is equal because no one can see under the ground.
That's right, even an engineer, they can predict, but
some of them are pretty good too. Now Steen was very lucky in a way, but he figured it out.
Did he?
Yeah, see, he found his discovery and we'd been over it one hundred times you know hunting and everything
else. We picked up pieces of it didn't know what it was because we had no counters or anything. It was kind of a black rock you know. So then we got the counters and we mined a little but, just surface you

know and---?--- like this---?--- back in a flash. He decided that there ought to be uranium so he went out and got a grocery man to stake him for groceries and a drill. The first hole he drilled he drilled right into the mineral, this big body of ore. I don't know how deep it was but he didn't have money enough to have it assayed so he carried it in his pocket a couple of weeks and finally he got around there where there was a counter and he went up to---?--- Babel- --?--- first counter then and he put it against the counter and it just went wild so he knew then that he had something really good. He ended up thinking it was just drilling. Then went in and there was nothing but ore. His fortune was made right then. It was one of the richest, the Mi Vida mine, one of the richest mines in the area.
PR: How much do you have to pay to get it assayed? Was this a large sum?
LW: Oh no, three or five dollars depending on what you had a knowledge for. But if you wanted uranium, vanadium-uranium I think costs five dollars or more.
PR: Did you know Howard Balsely?
LW: Oh very well, yes, we sold a lot of ore to him when
we was mining---?--- he was the only source that was buying. We bought the---?--- and we---?--- all our

ore to him. I've helped him sample, leased his claims. I was involved in the lawsuit, one of the claims that I got my biggest settlement on [that) he owned on Polar Mesa. I was leasing from him at the time and he got pretty good---?--- 10 percent.
So you had to help him on that?
Oh yes.
Very good. It sounds like you've had a very exciting
life as a miner.
Well, it was my life for about nineteen years you know, and so that's quite a long time to stay in the mines.
Uh huh. Sure is.
I've done nothing else. Like I say, at one time I was one of the largest independent producers during the boom. I could have been but I didn't. Like I say, a couple of times I was there and didn't know it. I walked off and left Temple Mountain, my best one and I had the whole thing operative and then turned it down and they didn't have nothing but ore there,

of ore that I was mining and then drilling and--
PR: Very close.
LW: I don't know. ---?--- had one on the reservation. We
were there fighting for this doggone group of claims there on Black Mountain buried in the Mesa Verde. They never did turn out good and the trading post came in and the Navajos wouldn't let them have it so we got into a duel over it you know, just a battle between the council and all that ---?--- and all that, but while we were there we became very good friends with one of the councilmen or all of them, but one of them in particular and the Vanadium Corporation of America had ---?--- Monument Valley ten claims up there you know. They only had so many acres on the reservation, 620, something like that, they had to release all of that stuff. So they were forced to release just one section you know. There's Monument Number Two and they'd drained a lot of ore out of it you know ---?--- way down to where there wasn't much left, you know, where they'd been mining.
They had drills and---?--- Babel and my brother Don Wright, he was down here and told that we could have it mining up there in a few days if we wanted it. Well, we ---?--- because ---?--- from Denver had a group of attorneys over there and we didn't want to

jeopardize our position and whatnot going this far by taking this claim. You know, that was their story. So we just turned it down against our better judgement actually. That's how Martin Giseman, they leased it to a guy from Farmington and he went off from where Vanadium Corporation of America ---?--- he drilled out $8,000,000 worth of ore ---?--- Vanadium Corporation.
Why yes.
PR:
LW: Yeah. ---?--- better you know. ---?--- claim, found
out later they didn't even drill. They just mined it till it ran out. So they built a mill there at Mexican Hat, Utah. That's just on the verge, the edge of [Arizona] and Utah border line on the San Juan River ---?--- Monument Valley. ---?--- ore ---?--- that was in '52.
PR: Your brothers are still in the mining business, are they not?
LW: Partly, yes.
PR: Is this a big corporation?
LW: Most of the ore is deep now, and I 'd say the only
independent miners I know of now that are mining now- -that's why my brother told me the other day--[in] Colorado. They're the ones that contract and clean up small deposits that the big companies don't---?---

Morrison formation, they don't mess with it anymore, they let an independent miner mine it out. They can
sit back there and make more of the milling end of it then they can--it actually costs them too much a ton to mine it.
PR: Did the Atomic Energy Commission help independent miners quite a bit?
LW: They did in a lot of ways, not too much. Most of the drilling that was done was done on the--how they did it I don't know, but on the big companies' mines the Atomic Energy paid for it. Really they were controlled by the big companies. I don't think the independent miner was ever free to gripe. I don't think the independent man in business is free to gripe in a lot of ways. For this one reason that's all. ---?--- but when you have to rely on somebody like big companies to pay you for the ore you know
and to go through them they cheat you. They have a method of doing this and you know it. What can you do now?
PR: You have very little recourse.
LW: Yeah. It wasn¥t supposed to be that way but that's
the way it was. I think it's always been that way and I don't think the independent person has much say so against corporations. I don't know why, but I guess
30

 L . B . WRIGHT # 1
if it weren't for the corporations the independents wouldn't be in business either.
PR: ---?---
LW: We'd have had no place to sell it if it hadn't have
been for them. ---?--- government did come in, the Atomic Energy [Commission] when they were buying ore, yes, they were very fair, and we were selling it to them. But they didn't buy too much. They had, like I
said, set up in Monticello, and we sold quite a bit of ore to them and we had a problem with---?--- at that time they couldn't recover it, so we were earning not an awful lot on our assay, just being paid for the recovery and that was real bad, so many things that entered in. You used to be able to mine ore---?--- and they couldn't ship anything less than two percent to Pittsburgh. Well, it just wasn't profitable and we could sack the same things and maybe get 50-50, maybe get one percent of it. So it just depends on the way they assay it, their recovery you know, and that's the way they put it. It wasn't
long after that--
PR: There's---?--- difficulty for a small miner---?--- LW: And when they run what they call an inability on
their ore you know to see what recovery would be before they would ever even accept that. ---?--- If
31

you had one percent ore and they only recovered sixty percent, you'd get sixty percent of the ore percent, so it would use 60 hundredths.
They control it there exclusively?
Oh yes, we had no control whatsoever.

PR: And that's when the boom arrived. People were very

---?---
Some of them did, some of them profited. Now like see where you had a big mine you had to sell to your independent too until they finally built their own mill, but ---?--- that he had enough money that he could represent himself right whereas a small man he could trust him to the point where you might call it grubstake all the time you know. Once in awhile you'd flow a little bit, hit a nice little streak, but
usually you could make a lot better than wages and that was about it. They won't allow you to make a lot of money. ---?---onetime at Temple Mountain the ore had assayed out to about twenty-six hundredths, all this ore in there, so I set up a big crew and I think I had about three or four hundred tons left, quite a
bit---?--- ten hundredths on the same ore.
Oh my goodness!

PR:
LW: An incentive for the prospector to get out there and
find more ore.
PR: At that time the government felt the need for ore
pretty badly? LW: Oh, they did.
PR: At the time the government felt that the ore in this country would run out and therefore they were getting it overseas. This really affected the small miners.
LW: Well actually yes, because they put them in the fields fast. They'd mined out all the mines that small miner mined anyway, so the small miner has no
method of going to the debts that these big companies are going to. Actually I think oil companies when they were drilling for oil and they've known it was there all the time, you know, the sampling of the ore as they go down.
PR: Probably be a high price---?---
LW: --to go down that deep. Yeah, and then they've done
it--that's very expensive drilling you know, 2000 feet costs a lot of money for the hole I guess.

They're really paying off---?--- Gallup---?--- and he was in this contracting, ---?--- he was one of the drillers and he was a couple of years in Gallup. Finally he one day [was] working down about 1000 feet and rock came in or something. It just went to his partner and billed him a hot rod hit or hit at all and how they was paying them then. He was making
$1500, $2000 a month.
It's become a skilled profession now.
Yeah, well, it's always been. A miner can't just walk in there and think he could make it. He's nuts because you can't do it. You've got to know how to shoot your ore, how to keep your ore clean enough, keep your grade up and---?---.
PR: LW:
PR: What is shoot your ore? I don't understand that.
LW: ---?--- shoot your ore out or shoot---?--- away from there, whichever is you--now, if you have a lot of ore you can shoot your ore. If you don't you have to shoot your waste you have to know how to shoot it to
keep from shooting your ore [at the] same time mixing
it in.
PR: Do you feel that you picked this up going with your
father?
LW: No, my father was actually--he hated mines ---?---
all the mines actually he was in the field he had the 34

 L. B. WRIGHT #1
mines staked you might say when he was way out in the service. In the early '30s he staked his claims in Utah, he held onto them, so that's where he first got
started i n the uranium business. Dad has always been unhealthy. He's been ar ound t he mines and promotion all his life, but actually to do the work he never did.
PR: That was up to you boys.
LW: Yeah. No, Dad didn't, but ---?--- but he thinks he
did. He knows more about it than anybody because we had him out in the field all the time or down helping us and he joined us ---?--- miners association. They're the ones that get the money for us. If it hadn't been for him Howard Balsely never would have gotten anything because they just stayed right on us and Tom Skidmore, they stayed right on us till we got something out. My dad made several trips, and we financed it to Denver to, you know, Stephen Nichols, the government agent in Colorado was the one that brought in that Alioto, Lawyer Alioto, what's his
name? PR: A lioto?
LW: Yeah. And they combined forces.

miners needed was someone that had time to or ganize . 35

We bargained from anybody. All of them got the credit
for it too because they just loved Dad in that area you know because he was fighting for them. We didn't have time to do it. We was too busy trying to make a living, fighting the corporations.
This has been very enjoyable for me and very informative. I thank you very much.
Well, for an independent miner that's been--everyone of 'em has the same story I'll bet, but there's no glory in it, we just had a lot of fun. Some of them made some money.
So it wasn't a loss did you say?
Not yet. We just loved it. Up in the hills and have a tent, live in a tent most of the time you know, with no floor in the winter and summer. We finally came up in the world and got us a trailer now set up in the morning you're sure to be frozen to the floor.
Those were the hard days of mining.
---?--- sit around and play cards until midnight,
