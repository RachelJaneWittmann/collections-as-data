XJ: Mrs. Juliana, what ---?---?
MJ: Well, we used all parts of the pig. We made sausage,
ham, upucolo, suprasal, and then the salami and then head cheese. We'd pickle the tongue and kidneys and we'd pickle the tripe or we used it or cooked it in tomato sauce. We made liver sausage, lung sausage, and blood pudding. We used the sweetbreads--that's a delicacy--for some time. But not at the time that we killed the pig. The pig had to be taken care of before for that. They used to cut those off when the pig was alive for certain reasons which I don't even remember, but they were delicious. That's what my dad said and we used to eat them and we used the pigskin. We used everything but the hair, the eyes, and the teeth. We used everything of the pig. We made beautiful lard, just cut up the fat and then let it soak overnight and then drain them out so that the blood would soak out of the lard. Then in the morning we'd put another container in and we used to put most of the lard in crocks. But some of the lard was for old traditions and they were put in the bladder, just not to forget how we did things in the old country. It was beautiful, these big white bags full of lard.

 MARY J U L I A N A # 1
We used to slice that just like you slice the cheese, slice the lard off when we needed it. It was so pretty. Also we used to--oh, we put sausage in lard and crocks. When the sausages were cured in the smoke house after the smoke here, we'd take them down and clean them and put them in a crock and melt some lard and pour it over the sausage, sausage and lard, it took a long time, and when we'd get one we'd just scrape the lard off and get out and wipe all the lard off and clean it as nice as you could.
XJ: Tell us a bit about the blood pudding.
MJ: The blood pudding was made out of the blood, and we
had to cook it with sweetening and sugar, I think it was brown sugar, raisins, nuts, and flavoring. It tasted very good, it was delicious, no one could tell it was made out of blood.
XJ: What ---?---?
NJ: We made sausage. You'd take the loin of the pig and
put it aside for salami, for suprasal, and that's the pig sausage as we used to call it. We made a plaque out of the large casing of the hog. The pepperoni sausage was made out of the small casing of the hog. In other words, intestines. Well, we used to grind the pepperoni and sausage finer, we had a big grinding machine and then we had a stuffing machine.

 MARY JULIANA #1
After we ground the meat we'd put it in a big container and we'd put in ---?---, salt, pepper, and that's about all, and mix it good. Then we would stuff it in this other machine that had a mouth at the other end where you could tie the casing on, the intestine. We'd use the crank on the machine that would push the meat into that intestine. Then we'd tie it at different intervals, either in circles or five inch strips. Sometimes we'd tie three or four circles of sausage at once and tie them together in five or six loops and hang them that way, they didn't take as much room in the smokehouse. The suprasal meat was salami meat, as they call it today, you used to grind a little coarser and put in the black pepper and the hot pepper, a little bit of it. We used to stuff that in the larger casing, the larger intestine. Then we'd tie those flat, and in case they had to lay flat, and then we'd hang them up. After they dried so long then we'd lay them on boards, on nice clean boards on top of the shelves, and we put another board on top with a lot of weight, rocks specifically, and we'd flatten them out. We'd go every day and press them with our hands and put them back on the board and put the other board on top so they pressed real hard. And that's what made the real

 MARY JULIANA #1
red salami. When you cut into it it was beautiful, it was red and cured and beautiful, but you had to work with it. The other salamis just end up in those large loops tied together and they'd just stay there until it was smoked a certain length of time. The hams, we used to trim the ham and the bacon and the capacola, the capacola was very intricate, you had to cut the loins a certain length, that's the capacola. We'd put all those meats, the ham, capacola, the bacon, in the brine, and the shoulder hams, and they have to stay in the salt, the brine and salt water. They had to stay in a certain length of time, I think it was from four to six weeks depending on how big they were. Then we'd take the hams out and wash them in cool water, dry them nice, and wipe them and put salt and pepper on the face of them and hang them in the smokehouse, the same with the bacon and the shoulder ham. But the capacola, we had to use different procedures. When you first kill a hog and you open it to butcher it, there is a membrane that covers the meat lard as they call it in the butcher shop, that's that beautiful white lard, . the best lard. It divides the organs from the entrails of the pig. Well, Papa would take out that leaf lard and I had to take off that membrane, and it looked like thin plastic. It
4

 MARY JULIANA #1
wasn't very easy to take off. That was put in brine water with salt and orange rind and washed and cured. When the capacola was ready the piece of loin was used for the capacola, we washed it nice and dry it, and then I spread that membrane on the table and sprinkled it with thines seed and red pepper and then put the loin on there and rolled the membrane around it, the membrane that looked like plastic. Then we'd tie it, we'd start from one end and tie it back up with twine. Then we'd put stilts on it, cut from grape boxes. The wood was real thin, and then they'd go around themselves again with the twine. It looked like pieces of legs that had stilts on them. Then we'd hang them in the smoke house. The capacola had to stay in there about as long as the hams, longer than the sausage so they'd cure better. Then when it was cured the capacola was beautiful. You'd get into it and the meat was red and the back part of it was beautiful and white. Beautiful.
XJ: Were there many farms?
MJ: There were many farms around here. The largest number
of farms were grain and al.falfa farms. They had many cattle, hogs, and some had sheep. But there were a few farms that engaged mostly in produce for a living. Our farm was at that time the Sacramento Farm
5

 MARY JULIANA # 1
in Spring Glen, and it had a big fruit orchard besides the large part confined to raising vegetables, because the Sacramento men really peddled their vegetables throughout this town. My dad did that too, and they had all kinds of vegetables and beautiful corn and fruit. We sold the corn, vegetables, grain, the cured meats, and cheese.
XJ: Ah, what was the ---?---?
MJ: Well, the national celebration, we all celebrated
together, all nationalities. But a typical Italian celebration was St. John's day on the 24th of June. All the Italians that do anything about the Church celebrate that day. I think St. John's sometimes stayed in the background; they had their own celebration, but it was supposed to be St. John the Baptist on the 24th of June. The Italians got together and they had their wine. If it was bad weather they would get together in the house and if it was good weather they would have a picnic outside. Then another celebration they used to call the Three Days that I referred to as the "Devil's Celebration." They all masqueraded and hqd an awful good time and I didn't see any sense to it. That was the three days, the drijourni they used to call it in Italian. My, they used to have hallelujah time, on the order of
6

 MARY JULIANA # 1 Halloween.
XJ: What time of the year is that?
MJ: It's--when are the three days coming up? Pretty soon,
right, before Easter? JJ: Yes.
MJ: In the period of Lent the three-day celebration comes up in the period of Lent, I think, and Holy Week, wasn't it John?
JJ: I guess. I didn't know ---?---
MJ: This time of the year.
JJ: ---?---
MJ: You see, I think that they got so tired of doing
Penance during Lent, then they had a real blast off
with the Three Days.
XJ: Was that ---?---?
NJ: Well, in the older days it was usually useful things,
things that we could wear. In these modern times the Italians are like anybody else, they buy useless things sometimes. Especially toys and things that break easy you know, it's just tradition among all nationalities that as a rule they used to buy clothing, shoes, and--wellr we got some--you know.
XJ: What happened during Lent?
MJ: During Lent we're supposed to do Penance. In the
older days some of those old timers practically
7

 MARY JULIANA #1
starved, they really fasted; they kept Lent in good order. Now, I think they are getting a little bit
more lenient, but Friday is still a dark day, and I don't think there is any Italian that will eat meat on Friday if he has any sense left. Because they did respect Lent, and they still do to a certain extent, but the rules of Lent now have changed, they have made them a little more lenient.
XJ: What did you do on Easter?
MJ: On Easter as a rule we'd take the little goat and
kill him, poor little goat, roast him, go on a picnic. If it was bad weather they would have a big party at the house and roast the goat and have all the other trimmings with them.
JJ: Yes, some ---?--- not there but ---?--- wine is good. ---?--- man and woman go on a hill.
MJ: Yes, they had it on a big hill and they went on picnics, they brought their guitars, they brought their accordions, and they played the music and there was a spot where they could dance, oh yes, they really had a good time. Like I told you, the men would play mura and the ladies would play other games with the children. They would sit down and sing and talk. "Do your thing," as they say today, they used to do their thing, anything that comes to their mind
8

 MARY JULIANA #1
that they've often had a good time they knew was--- ?--- within decent limits. Anybody did his or her thing, dance la tarantella in the dirt if they wanted to, and everybody pitch in and dance too, it was nice.
JJ: Now, you have better food.
XA: ---?---
MJ: Well, the Italian people were very, oh what is the
word? Economical. We were people that didn't waste anything. In fact, my mother used to sew beautiful bonnets in the old country, and when we come to this country she sewed all my dresses by hand and she did beautiful work. My mother could do hem stitching by hand. She used to make little bonnets for children and she could do the hem stitching herself by hand. Now they have little attachments to use on the machine or by hand to do that same kind of work, but she did it by hand. We always sewed our own clothes, we bought our own machine and we sewed. I started to sew when I was nine and I sewed clothes for all the family, skirts, dresses, anything, I sewed everything for the family.

THIS IS AN INTERVIEW WITH MRS. MARY JULIANA. [THE DATE IS] MARCH 29, [1973] IN HER HOME.

 MARY JULIANA #1
XJ: ---?---?
MJ: Well, as far as I can remember, when Mamma and I come
to America I was only five, but I remember Mamma bringing mostly as a souvenir a beautiful bedspread. I think they wove themselves and the people used to weave their own cloth. She brought a velvet camisole, they use to call it a camisole with sleeves. It used to double up in the front, it was a beautiful thing. They had here that they use to wear in those days that resembled--they had what the Daughters of Charity wear now, only a little longer, and only it was made out of white material, a heavy material like Indian head. That's about--oh, and the most precious thing, a big tin can, a beautiful can full of jewelry that we lost here in Price. Papa lost it in this vicinity somewhere. Then besides that we brought a lunch, and it was in a little sack I can remember, and I think what we put in that lunch were things that would keep, food that would keep like figs and cheese, zusela. Zusela is an egg cookie that keeps a long time, it's just the base of sugar and a little vanilla, and salami of some sort or even ham. That kind of lunch we brought, and maybe an apple or two or something like that. Anyway, it was food that kept
10

 MARY JULIANA #1
and it was a good lunch. That's about all we brought
with us.
XJ: You made your own cheeses?
MJ: We made cheese on the farm, four or five kinds of
cheese. The first thing to do to make cheese, you have to buy the rennet tablets, and it gives you the direction on the box, how much rennet tablet you have to use for so much milk. You heat the milk and use the rennet tablet, and then you break the curd and put it back on the stove and break the curd and sweep out all the wade and put in the basket mold. If you want to make the provolone kind of cheese that mold has to ferment for about twenty-four hours and you slice it up real thin and put another pan on the stove with water. When it comes to a boil you put that slice of cheese in and keep working it up and down in the boiling water with a wooden spoon and it threads like taffy, and then you handle it with your hands and you mold it into a bottle shape with sort of a big head. Then when those dried out for a couple of days--we used to salt them and put them in the smokehouse. Then we made chungata, and that is another kind of simple cheese. You break the mold like you did for the first cheese and you pick that up gently, you don't press the whey out like you do
11

 MARY JULIANA #1
with the first cheese. You pick it up gently and put it into the mold and let it sit in the mold for a couple of days and then take it out and salt it a little bit and put it where it could dry out and churn it and shake, and it forms a nice crust. The inside is always tender, it's on the order of mozzarella, only better than that. Then of course we made the braids out of the provolone and string cheese. I would help that when Mamma would braid, and we would make braids about a foot long and hang them to dry. Besides that, then the last thing we would make would be the gotta. We would put the whey back on the stove in the pan, and the first time you make it you have to put a little bit of vinegar and maybe a half a cup or more and a cup of milk, and when it comes up to a boil, well then you see that it floats on top. You pick it up with the strainer and the whey strains out and you put it in another mold and there is your tender gotta, it's better than cottage cheese.
XJ: What were some of your other foods that you had?
MJ: There are so many other foods. We had hams, pasta,
scallops, zucchini, potatoes, eggplant, and ministroni with the beans, horse beans. Now, the horse beans were good dry or green, jade cheese, wash
12

 MARY JULIANA #1
flowers, and dandelions, that was the item. Mamma always made minestrone with new potatoes and dandelions, sometimes with a little ham and sometimes just the oil from the garden, and it was very good. We had the banana pudding that would be--and dried fruit of some kind. We used to dry our own fruit, to dry squash I remember. We dried anything that we could dry. We had many things. We used to have asparagus, and in the meat line, like I said before, ham, capocola sausage, suprasal-- suprasal is salami today--bacon, and zalada, that's the shoulder ham. It was more tasty than the regular ham because it had
more bone in it, and zalada, now that's the front part of the side of the pork that they called, they call it side pork now, but we called them zalada, and we used that more than we did bacon. Headcheese, this is something that's made out of the head of the pig and we used to put it in containers. Zuchium, that's another thing that is made out of the head, sort of a pickled affair. We used to pickle the tripe, the tongue, the feet, the kidneys, I could pickle all of that. Then we used to . make blood pudding and zangulacha, that's what they call it, wheat bread. The pig skins, now that was a popular food, the pig
skins. They used to put them in a trough like the egg 13

 MARY J U L I A N A # 1
plant and the tomatoes with salt and pepper and mint leaves you know, then they'd take them four at a time and soak them, soak the salt out and cook them to make a little minestra with a pigskin, and they were good. Sometimes we used to fry them and they would get real hard and they would get crunchy and we liked to eat them. I think they have sort of a snack in the store now in that order, pigskins that are fried and all cooked up. They sell them in the store. Well, what else do you want? I told you about the different kinds of bread, ---?--- and things like that and espresso, and the other kinds of cookies.
XJ: What about, what were the foods you had on holidays? MJ: Well, like I said, for Christmas we had pasta noodles
or whatever we wanted the most, meatballs or ravioli, and we had salad and all the little extras, cheese, artichokes, olives, beets, mushrooms, and candy, and they were mostly nuts and those ---?--- greasy buns. We really had too much. And to drink, like I said, we had red wine and light wine rizollio or stuff and--- ?--- Let's see, anise, ---?--- anise, it had a anise flavor. We put anise in the Easter bread, and I had some come from Italy in there. Well, anyway, ask me.
XJ: What about ---?---?
MJ: Yes, at Easter time we had figs, I almost forgot
14

 MARY JULIANA #1
about figs. We used to buy the dried figs and cut them open and put a half a walnut inside and we used to love them, oh yes, always Easter we had figs and nuts and the different kinds of cookies, like I told you, and the Easter bread with the aniseed in it. I still make it.
XJ: Tell us how you make it.
MJ: Well honey, the Easter bread is made--the ordinary
bread is made with eggs, lots of eggs, you see, and then you make it stiffer, and you just roll it in a big roll when it's ready to roll and you make a big circle roll, see? But you put the aniseed inside and you put a little bit on top. Then we leave some dough for the children. We always roll it about an inch in diameter and about a foot long you might say. We would make a wheel out of those strips, and we used to boil the eggs ahead of time of course and put an egg in the middle and then bring those wheel spokes around and make sort of a design with a nice round flowered loaf of bread. Then we'd break an egg or two and brush the yolk on top of the ---?--- when the flour designed bread we. used to make for the children. You used to bake all of that in the outside oven, but I have made it in my own stove. We had the ordinary bread of course, sometimes we made ---?---
15

 MARY J U L I A N A # 1
but the Easter bread is a harder kind of bread than the ordinary bread. It is not quite so soft, it has a lot of eggs in it and a little sugar, it's not too sweet. But the most important thing is the aniseed, Easter bread must have aniseed. It put a different flavor in the bread.
XJ: Tell us about the wines, how you made them and what kinds did you make?
MJ: Well, my father as a rule made the Muscatel wine with the dark grapes that made the nice dark red wine. But he also made the white Muscat wine out of the big white grapes. It was sort of amber color and it was very delicious. Well, Papa started out by making wine the old fashioned way. I bought him a pair of white rubber boots and a brand new tub in it, and they were used especially for that purpose. He would stomp the grapes in that tub and then of course he would take it from there and put it in the barrel. Then he'd take the mash and put it in another barrel and put in a little bit of water and a few raisins and a little bit of sugar to help him. That's what he called his second wine, and that had.to stay so long before he could put it in the jugs or in the bottle. But Papa loved to taste it, so by the end of the time required to age it there wasn't much left. (Chuckle) But it
16

 MARY J U L I A N A # 1
was always nice to watch him. You go up and down against that wine. As I told you before, later on we got more modern and Papa used to borrow the press from people that made more wine than we did, and it's just a round press that presses the juice out of the grapes, and it's easier that way than the old fashioned way of stomping the grapes. Wine has to stay in the barrel so long before it acquires the right taste. Of course the longer it stays, the better it tastes. New wine tastes good enough I guess if you want to drink it that bad. But you have to let it age so long before you can really call it good wine. I've forgot the time it took to age the wine. That was hardly my department, I didn't even drink it then, but it was very good wine and we made both kinds. We made root beer all the time, and I did make some dandelion wine for Papa years ago when we lived in Spring Glen, and that's very good.
XA: How do you make that?
MJ: Well, as far as I can remember, like I said before it
was an almanac recipe. I read the recipe and I picked the dandelion flowers, it required dandelion flowers, so many quarts, and so much water, and brown sugar and raisins and maybe a little something else that I have forgotten. I had to simmer that for a certain
17

 MARY J U L I A N A # 1
stage and then mix the flavors. Then I bottled it and then I had to dig a hole, that's what they said, to dig a hole and fill it with straw and put the bottles in there and cover them with straw and with some more dirt, and they have to stay there a certain length of time to age. After that time I took the bottle out and told Papa to try it, and he tried it and he said it was very good. I said, "Papa, what does it taste like?" "It tastes like some kind of rum, it's very good. What is it?" I said, "Well Papa, it's dandelion wine. I tried to make something for you . " He said, "Very good." But I never made it again, I just made it once.
XJ: How did you make root beer?
MJ: Root beer, well honey you have to have I think
something from the store to start out to make root beer with. I haven't made it for years, but I'm pretty sure that you have to buy something from the store. I think it's a little bottle of flavor that you start with, see, and then it tells you on the bottle what else you need. Well, truthfully--well, we used to make it in a crock, it had to stay so long, that much I remember, and then we used to bottle it. We had bottles with spring corks on, and we still have some in the old cellar, and we'd bottle it and
18

 MARY JULIANA #1
put it away in it and it had to age a little bit.
XX: Hi.
XJ: How are you?
XX: Oh, it's good to be here.
MJ: Sometimes we put it in crocks. XX: Hi.
