Howard Browne 9-19 - 83

HB For something else, you know.

L

OK. {talks about finishingthe interview}

Let me just ask you then to - about leaving Carbon County.

Why did it come about and how?

HB Well, the way it came about was that I came up here in

about 1937. During the summer. And got a job with the

railroad just for the summer. And then I had to go back

to Carbon County to get a regular job and go to my

regular job in the coal mine. And I also did that in

about 1938. Same thing. But I didn't have a regular

job with the railroad. And my wife and family, they were

staying in Carbon County while I was~ there working on

the railroad. And I think it was about early 1939, I

brought my family up here. And my wife lookedaround

up here. I might have brought her up here in 38, I don't

know. But anyway, she didn't like living down in Carbon

County and when she came up here, she said, we've got to

move up here to Salt Lake if we can find the place. So

I think it was 39 when we moved up here, wasn't it? The

spring of '39?

Wmn July. July 1939.

HB YEah, we cameup here. We found the place. And the real

estate agent that we contacted, why, they were having

a campaign on to see who could sell themost homes. And

so we started looking around and he showed us a place

down by the railroad tracks, under the viaduct. And we

didn't like down there. He showed us another place that

- was close to the railroad tracks. And we didn't like it.

Howard BRowne 9-19-83 s1:2

So then, he said, I've got one more place but I don't think

you'll like it because of your kids. So, we told him, well,

just go ahead and show it to us, anyway. So he showed it

to us. And, we said we'll take this place. It was right on

t~e Jordan River. Andthatwas the reason he thought maybe

wemight not likeit. On account of the kids were so small.

But anyway, we liked that better than any of them that he

had shown us. So. we decided to take that place. And, he

wanted $300 down, wasn't it?

Wmn Somethinglike that.

HB Somethinglike $300 down. But the whole place didn't cost--

They ~re asking $1200, I think for it. And so, I had a new

--I mean a 1936 Ford car. And I had to go and borrow money

on it so I could go and try to get the $300 down payment.

And they wouldn't let me have that much- And the man was

so anxious to win this contest that he said, lAEll, I'll

tell you what I'll do. I'll let you have the rest of it

and then you can pay me back so much a month for the balance

of the down payment. And so. We did that. Andout monthly

payments weren't but $12 month.

L

$12 a month, huh?

HB Yea. And I didn't have any regular job- So, anyway. We

went on back to Carbon County and got a trailer and hooked

on to the back of the car. And moved what personal belongings

we had down in Carbonville in that trailer. We ~ved

them o up to Salt Lake.

L

Was one of thereasons youmoved up because jobs were dryin

up there too, where things bad down there?

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s1:3HB

w

HB Well, coal mining jobs weren't drying up. And then I

worked on my mother's farm in the summer. But. My wife

wasn't satisfied down there.

L

What was the problem down there. Maybe we should be

asking you? What was the problem down in Carbon County?

Wmn Well, Ihad been used to going to church-&I had been used

to being around Black people. And there just wasn't

anything to do down there in Carbonville. Except maybe

to go to a bar or go to a movie. Something like that.

And just

. And it got quite monotonous. And

not only that, in the cummer time, the mine job dried

up. They were over. That's thereason they came to Salt

Lake- In the summer time, they worked on the railroad.

They worked with the railroad. And in the winter, he would

come back to Salt Lake. The railroad jobs dried up.

L

You'd come back to Carbonville.

Wmn Carbonville. And work inthe mines. But then he also got

tired of the mines. He didn't like themines. He never

liked the mines. So, another reason is we figured that

maybe I could get some employment up here, too. So that's

one of the reasons that we moved. Some of the reasons.

HB The main reasons.

L

Main reason. Now, one thing I don't understand is why did

the coal mines close up in the summer?

HB i Well, they didn't have any market for coal inthe

summer time.

L

I see, so the market for coal was just primarily heating--·

heating coal.

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s1:4

HB Yeah, heating coal. And cooking. For cooking. You see,

here in Salt Lake even. At that time, most everyone had

coal stoves. And furnaces. And things like that. They

get their winter supply of coal inthe fall. People up

here-most of the residents up here--very few people had

gas. Only reason they had gas woul d)e for water heaters.

But otherwise, why, ~ey used coal. And then later on, why, they

got to talking about smog and stuff like that and I think

the gas companies, why, they wanted to increase their

market. So they got a bill passed for -- They outlawed the

coal burners. Even on the railroads. The railroads used

to have steam engines that burned coal. And they outlawed.

They made this law and the railroad had to change over to

deisel engines instead of steam engines.

L

Hmm- When did that come about. {repeats}

HB It came abouteither the latter part of the war years or

at the end of the war years. Because duringthe war years,

why, they were using steam engines.

L

That must have cut into the coal market, too, then.

HB Ahuh. Yeah.

L

So now youwere mentioning about that house, really. I

interrupted you. You were talking about the house

with the $300 downpayment.

HB Oh, well, after we moved in there, why, then I just took

any kind of job that I could get. I cut lawns for people.

L

Let me ask you something, is that the house you had all

the trouble with interms of the petition.

Wmn Yes.

L

Thatis, could you tell me alittle about that. Last time

Howard BRowne 9- 1-983 s1:5

we didn't get that on tape.

HB Well, we had lived there for several years. And another

Black family was going to move in that area. And, this

Mormon guy that lived about 2 blocks from us. He found out

about it. So he got a petition up and went around to

all the white peoplea round in that area and to get them

ro sign this petition. To keep all Blacks out of that

area. Cause they didn't want them in there. And a white

neighbor of ours that lived in the back of us about 3

houses down the street--he came and told us what was going

on. And, he told the guy, 'Hell, no, I'm not going to sign

no petitition like that. The Browne's over here, they're

some of the best neighbors we've got.' So when he told

us that, I toldhim to carry a message back to this man .

And tell him if he didn't want any Black folks here, w~y,

in the neighborhood, why, he could get rid of me. He could

buy me out but he wouldhaveto meet my price. So I said,

Otherwise, don't try to move me out because you're

going to have a whole lot of trouble on your hand. So we

neverheard any more about that.

L

Who~s the guy doing that petitionf

HB I forget his name, but he was in charge of the scales down

there on Second South and Fourth West, I guess it was.

Right down from the railraod depot.

L

It wasn't Sheldon Brewster, then.

HB No. Oh, no. But, he was, ah, weigh master down there. He

weighed all these great big trucks that came in there to

· get their weight-

L

Is that about the same time as Sheldon Brewter--tried

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s1:b

HB Yeah, it was right along in there.

L

Tried to getthem to move into the - in the railroad

track area, in the northwest part of salt lake.

HB Yea. It was along or the same period.

L

I remember you spoke about~ newspaper article. That

you saw at that time.

HB Yeah- I cut it out. Kept it for years. Then lost it,

somehow.

L

What did the newspaper article say?

HB Well, the newspaper article said that while we tolerate

the Blacks, they didn't use that term, then, - What'd

they call us then? Negros?

Wmn No. I think t

HB Colored.

Wmn I think at that time,he didn't mention either one. They

just said undesirables.

HB Yeah. undesireables. While we tolerate these undesirables

that are alr.eady here, we are not encouraging anymore to

come in. And he was a President of the Salt Lake Realty

Board at that time.

L

And Brewster was the one that wrote the article?

HB Sheldon R- Brewster.

L

Was that a shocking thing to see that in the paper?

HB Well, during that time it wasn't shocking, no.

L

No.

HB Because we knew all about the restricti~e covenants and

everything that they had to keep people out, certain people

out of certain areas. you know.

Howard Browne 0-19-83 s1:7

HB In fact, ths house right here came under--All this area

came under that same thing. That restrictive covenant. Be-

cause when we bought this house and went to sign the--sign

thepapers, in these papers it had this clause.

L

wat did the clause say?

HB Ah,

L

approximately--

HB That they couldn't. Whoever owned this property. Whatever

white person owned this property, they couldn't sell it

to Orientals, ah, Mexicans, non-Caucausion people. So

when I went down to sign the paper, I saw this clause

and I said, well, _I'm not going to sign any paper with

th i s ki n d of c 1au s e i n . ,,/
~7
And they said, well, you don't need to worry aout that

at all-We'll -- we'll strike that out. The real estate

people said, We'll just striek taht out. That's just an

old clause that they have in there. And since that time,

these things have been lifted. And I said, we'll you'll

have to strike it out before I'll sign these papers. Be-

cause if I own the property, I'm going to sell it to who-

ever I want to sell it to. But all of these places--

whoever owned this up here. See, this is called the

Canyon Rim Dsitrict in here. And the guy that owned this

why, he put that clause in there. So that - Try to keep

it Lily White as they call it. {laughs}. So that's

where. And they probably had--msut have had them over

there in that area. But, where we bought our first

- house, butI've never noticed it. Because when we bought

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s1:8

~L HB
L
L HB

that place, we bought it under FHA- As Federal Housing Administration. So they wouldn't have anything in therelike that. Why did you cut out the article. Well, I cut it out for future reference because -- so that I could show people if we got in discussion about racial issues and thingslike that. To show them what was going on here in Salt Lake. And I cut it out for future reference. I just had the idea that people wouldn't beleive what I was syaing. And I had the proof {laughs} in writing. I even had it dated and everything butI don't know what happened. You thought people would doubt that that happened. Oh, yes. Yes. {says quietly} Yeah, because right now, right here in Salt Lake there's alot of white people that don't know--They're not familiar with alot of that stuff that was going on. They didn't participate in it- And alot of them didn't even have any contact with Black people. And we- years later, why we would meet -- Have some occasion to meet White people that had neverrl-never associated at all with Black people. They probably didn't have anything against Black people but they probably didn't have any occasion to associatewith them. So, And usually, usually, why Whitepeople, they brigg up the race question in some kind of way. Like what? Oh, well, I don't--let's see. {pause}. Ah- Like they'd say, well, you know, I've never been around you people beofre or colored people before, what do you prefered to be called: colored or negro? Or what? See, I've never

Howard Browne 9-1-983 s1:9

had occasion b be around you before and I don't know

anything about you. All I know is everyonce in awhile

I read something in the paper cr something like that.

And you see, during that period of time, why, they

wouldn't even let Black People play on major league

baseball teams. Or football teams. Or nothing like that.

And then when it opened up where they were playingon it,

then white people that didn't know anything baout black

people, why they'd read about this Black person playing on

major league baseball or soemthingliek that, you know. And

then if we had occasion- Sometime we would have. Well, we

alwys had white friends. And some white friends would rave

a party or something and invite us and we'd meet people

there that had neverbeen ~ound Black people before. And

so the discussionwould finally get around to race. And

so many white people always want to impress you that they

don't have any prejudices {laughs}. In them. You know.

{chuckles}.

L

You believe it.

HB No, I don't care to even--When theystart talking like that,

well, I'm pretty well through with the conversatio~-

Becuase they don't need to tell me they're not prejudice.

I can tell it. I can sense it. Excuse-- {interupption}

L

Hmm, my, my. What were we saying before you left. We were

talking about the converstaions you get into sometimes

with people when they claim they're not prejudiced.

Howard BRowne 9-19-83 s1:10

HB Well, usually. Usually, in some of these gatherings, why,

therace question comes up, And depdns on who brings it

up. Sometimes~ some one may bring the race and the way

it's brought up, why, immeditaly I get tense and get cautious.

With some people, that bring up the race question, why I'm

perfectly relaxed and will t.alk with them about it. But n-

unless I bring it up. If I should be the one that would

bring it up, why then! can talk freely about it. And they

can ask me any questions they want. Justlike you're talking

to me. But, with some people, the way they bring it up,

why immediately, my hackles come up and I get very cautious.

Because I'm thinking--I'm thinking ahead of what they

probably are thinking . I'm thinking that they're going to say

something eventually that's going to make me angry, see.

L

Sounds like you've been through that situation often.

HB Oh, yes. Yes, sir.

L

Hmm.

HB ANd Black people all over the United States, why, they've

always been. They've been cognizant of the feeling of

whitepeople. All of us have gone through about the same

kind of situation. Some worse than others. When I was

working for the railroad, I took many an insult from

white people. Such as I was a Red CAp down there at the

station and when a passenger fromsome certain area of the

country would come in with -- Hey, boy! Always address

a Black person as "boy" or "George" or "Sam" or something

liek that, you know.

L

Why George or Sam?

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s1:11

HB Well, in the south, that's what they 0lways called them,

"George" Sam. All Black men were nsam" or "George."

They'd never ask you what your name was. You automatically

were Sam or George to them. And that was ~sulting to me.

And I wold let them know what my name was. I said, My

name is Howard. Ifyou can't call me Howard, call me Red

Cap. My name is not George. And I know one particular

instnace, to show that it wasn't just me, it was all Black

people. There was a porter on the STreamliner, the City

of Los Angelos, one day, and a man andhis wife were

looking for a certain Pullman car. And they asked, hey,

George, where is such and such a car? Well, they were right

there at the car. And he said, "Wel, George is way back

there, almost tothe end of the train. You'll find him back

there." And so they had to walk clear back to the end of

the train {laughs} and they were azlready rightthere by

the car. But that was his way of getting back at them, you

know, becuase it was an insult to him. He said, Go on,

way back down ther,pretty near the end of the train. You'll

find George back there.

L

What did a Redcap do?

HB He handled people's luggage. He would get their luggage at

the front of the station. If they wanted help with their

luggage. If they wanted to load it on the train. And he

would find out where they were going. If they were on a

Pullman, he would get their resrvation. And then he would

take their bags down andload i t in the car th~t they were .

supposed to go on. And then show the people where their

Howard BRowne 9-19-83 s1:12

car was and everything.

LKind of like a host, almost.

HB Yes. And, whatever other information they wanted, why a

redcap usually could give it to them. Sometimes Redcaps

could give them betterinformation than the ticket agents.

Because they knew what time the trains were coming in

and when they left. And approximately what time they were

due to arrive, say, Denver, or Chicago. Or - They just

knew that automatically and they did.

L

Because you had to keep with the schedule.

HB Ahuh.

L

What were your feelingsabout the job of being a redcap,

when you got it?

HB Well, I liked the job. Because at that time, why,

we weren't getting paid but 90 dollars a month. But

we depended . on the tips that the people would give us

forhandling their bags. Because they wold always give us

some tips, you know. Give us tips, you know. And. Our

tips alot of times would amount to more than what our

salary was.

L

So you could make some decent money on the job, you're saying?

HB Yeah, make a living. And whe you took time with people

and explained things to them, why, they didnt' feel badly

about giving you somethng, you know.'

L

Sure, I can understand that.

Wer eyou involved with the unionizing of that group?

HB Yes. -

Howard BRowne 9-19-83 s1:13

L

Could you tell me how you got involved with that?

HB Well, one of the main reasons I got involved with it

was because of some of our own people. The Black redcaps.

Theolder redcaps. That werein charge. They were the head--

head redcap and that kindof thing. And sometimes they

treated us worse than the white ~ople, you know.

L

No kidding.

HB Employees. around there. Well, theyjust pushed their

weight cround there, you know, because they wre the boss

and that kindof thing. So and then they would ah assign
you m jobs where you could't make any money. And then you'd

have to do. In other words, you'd have to do the dirty

work, you know. So, someof us got together and said

that we wanted to--we'd better get into a union.

L

How many of you were there?

HB Oh, I guess _there must have been about 14 of us. And,

ah, so, there -- All the younger. Most. All the younger

fellows thought that was a pretty good idea, but the

older fellows, we couldn't even talk to them about no union~

you know.~, I was familiar with CIO at that time. Because

CIO and the United Mine Workers oent in togehter down in

Carbon County. And CIO, why, they were supposed to be non-

discriminatory, you, know. Well, there at the railroad,

the brotherhood of railway clerks. They were discriminating.

They were discriminatory. So. I ther was a union over

in OGden that the Black redcaps belonged to. And it was

connected with the CIO- So, I said, well, let'.s go over

Howrd Browne 9-19-83 s1:14

there and talk to them and see about getting b the cro.

L

Which union were you talking about now. What was it called?

In ogden.

HB well, it was--

L

Did it have anything to do with

Jones?

HB No, F

Jones was a -- He was a cook.

L

But wasn't he involved with theborhterhood of ah-not

the dining car?

HB YEah, Dining Car waiters. Dining car waiters and cooks.

But thatis a different union.

L

So you had nothing to do with that.

HB No. And so we talked to them and they said, well, they

If we wanted to get into it, why, theonly way we could get

in CIO we'd have to join up with themcwer there-Becuase

they didn't have it over here in Salt Lake- So they got

wind of the fact that we were interested in getting in

the CIO. And at that time, there was a senator here

that was from Carbon County named Frank Birnachi- Well,

he had been head of the United Mine Workes down in Carbon

County and all that area. Before he got to be a senator.

So, we contacted him. And he said, well, ok, if you want

to get in the CIO and want to get inthe Union, why, I'll

come down and set it up for you. So they got wind of it

down there at the Railroad. And the day we were supposed

to have the meting, we went into the Station Master's office

to have the meting. And at that time, Gracon was a--A man

by the nameof Gracen, he was head of the Brotherhood of

Railway Clerks- So, some of these older redcaps --one

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s1:15

espeically, I know he told him. So he was there.

L

Was Gracen white or black.

HB Oh, he was white because he was ~erthe--

L

Over the

HB Over the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks-

L

Now, the Brotherhood of RAilway Clerks just exlucded y.pu.

HB Yes.

L

Just flat out excluded you.

HB Yea. Well, they didn't flat out exclude us. But we knew

that they were discriminatory and prejudice. So, we didn't

even contact them about getting into their union. But

at this meeting, why, Frank Birnachi said that he'd

come down there to organize us. And put us in the CIO be-

cause we wanted a union. So gRacen spoke up and said, no,

you can't do that. He said, because the Brotherhood of

Railway Clerks represent all the station employees, ah,

the -- Eveyrbody thatworks in the stat:o~-The clearks

and everything else, they are represented by Brotherhood

of Railway Clerks. So if anybody takes them in, it will

have to be us. Because you can't take them in. The
Union PAcific won't even recognize the cro. So, sure

enough, at that time, the Union Pacific wouldn't recognize
the cro. So they took us in. I mean, we couldn't go in

the CIO so Fran Birnachi said, well, if we can't take them

in and the Broterhood of Railway Clerks represents all

of the station employees, why, ou go ahead and take them

in but treat them right! So they took us in. Andthey

put us in an auxiliary of theBrotherhood of Railway Clearks-

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s1:16

So we had our own officers. And everything. But, we weren't

actually a part of the big union, the Brotherhood of

Railway Clerks. We justhad our own little auxiliary. Nothing

but Blacks in it.

L

What wree youcalled? You had the same name, right?

HB Yeah, we had the same name, Brotherhood-- Ah-

We had I think it was Auxiliary No. 12 or something like

that.

L

I'm not sure what it means to be in an auxiliary. What

does thatmean?

HB Well, I don't know exactlywhat it means iether, but in

1955, The United Sates Supreme Court declared all auxiliary

unions iwthin a union was unconstitutional.

L

so you joined the uion about 1940-41?

HB Oh, no. no. It was later. LAter. Almost I imagine it

was about- . oh, I don't know, about 46 or 47 - something

like that. But my impression is of an auxiliary is just

a little group of people together within a big union.

But not acutally. Well, I guess we were considered as a

--as a full member of the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks.

BUT. We didn't have any bumping privileges or nothing

as far as the white people were concerned. We could bump

each other. Use or seniority. But we couldn't bump any

white people in that union. And a lot of us were older

than a whole lot of the white ~ople that were down there,

if we ever wanted to kinds of jobs. But we couldn't get

them because we coudl-t exercise our seniroity. So, when

the Supreme Court declared Auxiliary Unions unconsitituional,

Howard BRowne 9-19-93 s1:17
the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks had to getbusy to find out what they were going to do with us. And the railraod had to get togehter to find out what they were going to do with us. So, we --in 65, we filed a complaint with the
EEOC, back in Washington, D.c. and they sent a representative out here from Washington, D.c. And we had a meeting up at
the State Capitol. Up at the Lt. Governor's Office. Had railroad representatives and brotherhood of railway lcerks representatives. There were several of us Redcaps that were~ thereto represent the Redcaps. So what they decided to do with this meeting was to take all the Black Redcaps according to their seniority and put them at the bbttom of the seniority roster. And thenour seniority would start from that date on the big roster. Now, I'd been there since 1939, but my date would start in 1965. {laughs} So, - you want me to go on with this. {You want me go on with this-Oh, yea, says Leslie} So then, the REdcaps chose two of us out of the bunch to represent them. They ahd already chosen two of us to represent them. And that's when we went back to Washington, D.(. and filed this complaint . So we got back down to the station and we weren't satisfied. I said, I'm not satisified at all. You mean to tell me that my seniority date is going to start in 65 and I was hired in 39? Well, that's what I asked them up there at the capitol. Now, the man that they sentout here. Before this happened, we had been up tothe State Capitol to the CivilRights Commission. The · man that was up therem Andhe said, I think you've got a case, but I can't do anything · about it. He said, But I'll

Howard BRowne 9-19-83 s1:18

get in touch with Washingoon, D.(. I'll get in touch with

Meenie and see if he'll send somebody out here. So,

that's how they sent somebody out here. Now, who they sent

out here was a Black guy that had been head of the Waiters

and Cooks Union down in Frisco.

L

What's his name?

HB Pollard. P-0-L-L-A-R-D. So he's the one that came out here

and he had this board and he was showing us all on this

board. He said, now, I don't see anything wrong with this.

He says, you'll --While this might not benefit the older

men it will benefit the younger men because they'll be

building up seniority allthe time. I ssia,d well, what

zre you goign to do about my sneiroity from 1939- I said,

some of them in here are older than that. He said, well,

they can exercise their seniority within this group. of

Redcaps, you know.

L

Within the old auxiliary.

HB YEah. So, we weren't satisfied with it. So, we went

back to this man, up at the capitol and told him we weren't

satsified. So he got in touch with EEOC again. And they

sent another man out here to talk with us. And he was a

white man. So, he says, you definetly got a case.Andhe

told us to get all the material that we could get together

that would be pertinent to the case. And so that dragged

along for awhile so in 1970 or--

end side one

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s2:19

HB In the meantime, why, we went to this man again. And he

--They sent another EEOC man up. They sent him from

Alberquerque, New Mexico. And he was a Black man. And

so he--Is that it?

L

Hey, boy? That woman knows where things are.

HB Yes, she knows where things are.

L

When you were talking about the older guys, how large

of a group of guys are you talking about?

HB Well, let's see. ther was justone. One old guy at that

time when we put the --

L

And what was their objection to what you were doing?

HB Why, he was -- He was always in the ~sition. He was head--

Head redcap and he was in a position that he would talk

to the Head white guys and had the respect of the head

white people like the superintendent. And all of them,

you know. And he could get a lot of concessions that he

wanted for himself. But he wasn't getting them for us.

you know. He had his position. Already secured. And

that. And he was just a dirty guy, that's all- No good.

And we knew that. He had relatives that were Redcaps

but they didn't even trust him. So. We wouldn't let him

know aAything about what was goinga, because we knew he

would carry it right ot the top, you know. And tell them

what was going on, because he had done that before. Because

he's the one that did it whenwa were trying to get organize.

L

He was the one that got in the way of it then, too.

HB Oh, he told them, he told them what was going on and that's

the reason the head of the brotherhood of Rail.way Clerks

was down there and everything. Ottherwise, he would--Head

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s2:20

of the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks never would have

anything about it. If~ hadn't told.

L

Hmm.

HB Andthen when we had thismeeting up at the capitol with

the lt. governor. Why, he was up there. Andwe were

telling what was going on and everything. We never got.

We told him we never got paid for certain things and

that. Andhe said, "Well, I got paid. I got mine. If ~u

all didn't get yours, that's your fault." Hmmph. So

that's the reason, see.

L

Hmm. So now, a numberof years went by between '65 when

it first came out and during the time that thepeople

came like Pollard left. You were disatisfied. What was

ht ®utcome. How did things get resolved.

HS Well,they sent this man from Alberqueque, which was a

Black man. He came in and he met with me and the other

fellow that was representing the Redcaps. And then he

said, well, have all the rest of the fellows come.

We'll have a meeting. Now theother fellow

representing

them--his name was Jake Green. And, so, he told us, he said,

now, you've ~ta good case. But, he says, the EEOC doesn't

have the - the p:Jwer to handle your case. But we can

advise you and we can give you all the help that you need.

And my advice to you at this time is to hire you one or

two good attornies to handle this case. And whatever

material they need. We'll give it to them. He said,

the EEOC is supposed to be an instrument for equal rights

and everything but we don't have any teeth. We can't demand

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s2:21

anything. So, he said, now, what I want you to do is to

list all of the damages thatyou think you are entitled

to. And he said, don't be lenient. Make it as much as

possible. List different things whereyou think that ~u--

like if you couldhave had your equal rights, why, you

couldhave had certain jobs that would pay a certain amount

of money and the differencebetween that and allthat. List

all those kinds of things. And send them to me. And have

some so youcan show your attorney. So, we did that.

And then in 1971, no before 71, about 1969 passenger service

was falling off and they were cutting ~t trains and they

were pl~nning on doing away ·with trains So they had laid

off mostof the redcaps. Therewas about 4 of us left. And those

that were left why then they start making us do

janitor work. And I refused to do it. I even went to

the asst. sµperintendent and says, I wasn't hired as a

janitor. And I don't want to do janitor work. So, well,

you're going to have to do it, he says. I was a janitor.

one time, back in Kasnas. I said, yeah, you're asst.

superintendent now. I said, do you think I'll ever be

asst. superintendent? I said, I sure don't want to do

janitorial work. Andthey kept after me and after me and done

everything, threatening me.

So I used every excuse I

could- I said I was injured down here some years ago,

and I can't be swingingno mop and all hat. And so

then they finally said, well, youcan dust off the benches.

Now, here's a note-that we got from a guy that was

station master. And that's what he wrote about that.

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s2:22

L

It certainlys eems like janitorial work to me. Boy.

The tone of it's pretty nasty too.

HB So, in 71, they cut out all the passenger trains. All

the railroads, they did away with passenger service.

So then they informed me that I had to bid on some kind

of job that I could hold down in the North Yard or some-

place, so I bid on a job driving a crew bus down in

the North Yard. And I was driving the crew bus. And then,

a woman that was hired in 1959, she decided that she

wanted to drive the crew bus, so she bumped me off the

crew bus. So, I had to go on another job.

L

How could ~he bump you--she was hired in ·59.

HB Well, see my date didn't start till 65. {laughs}

L

Oh, I forgot.

HB So then in- then another guy bumped me off another job.

He was hired in 1963. I was just getting bumped around

all the time. Andin ~e meantime, all this case was building.

So in 1974, it went to court. Got ft in court. We had hired

two ~ung lawyers. Andthey had done a lot of research in

Denver and all. So actually, they had each one of us

testify. They had me testify first. And I mok all day.

And they asked me alot of questions and they said, well,

what job do you think-one of the lawyer-- The union sent

their lawyer from Cincinatti. And the Union Pacific they

had their lawyer from Omaha. So, Omaha and here. And so

htey asked me, well, what job do you think you're qualified

to hold? I said, Mister, I can hold any job you've got from

v

the uperintendent on down. {laughs}. So, anyw~y, it lasted

for a week-And just before - I mean, not quite a week. A long

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s2:23 about Firday. It started on Monday and along about Friday, why our lawyer said they want to -- It looks like they want to settle. So. Me and the--Jake Green, said, well, what do they want to settle for. We were suing them for a half million dollars. So, he said, well, they want to settle for 70 or 80 thousand dollars. I said, no way, tell them to forget it. So then the next day, why, it was they - -the trial was going on and theycalled us out again. Well, they've upped the settlement. I said, w,at is it now? They said 150 thousand dollars. So, I told theguys, I said, now, you know, they'renot going to offer us much more. And actually, my advice - now you do whateveryou want to do - cause you're the majority. But, what I would do would be to accept this settlement because if we don't and the Union and the Union Pacific decide to prolong this thing, they can appeal and appeal and appeal and a lot of us will be dead before it's ever settled. I said, these big companies, why they can prolong things so long. So, most all theother guys, they said, well, yes, we' better take your advice. So we settled for 150 thousand dollars. And since that time there's been 2 or 3 of the guys that were in this case that have died. Died not long after the case was over. But anyway, after the case was decided, I went back down to the North Yard. They had me walking tracks and taking box car numbers and allthat crap. So when I wentback down there, why, they said, "Well, we heard you won your case." Well, when we won the case, I got my seniority from 1939. And, so, the Head clerk downthere, he said, well, I see you won your case. Well, what are

Hoard Browne 9-19-83 s2:24

you going to do? I said. I'm going to bid on another job.

"What job areyou goingto bid on?" I'm going to bid on the

highest paid job you got down here. That's what I did,

I bid on crew dispatching job. And I was a crew dispatcher

when I retired. {laughs}.

L

You're saying that}Ouwere probablythe last Black crew dis-

pathcer they had--

HB That' they'll ever have. I was the first one and only one.

The train crew dispatcher that they've ever have.

And they neverwill have another one. That I- I don't think.

Becuase they're not hiring Black people as clerks.

L

tha'ts a long fight, that was.

HB Yeah, long, tough fight-

L

You know, when you talk about incidence in your life,

most of them soundlike fights, mostofthem sound like

battles. When you look back on things, do you feel that

way?

HB As battles? Yes. {laughs}

Wmn All through

HB Well, I started off at theUnion Pacific badly. And I got

the name of being a trouble maker by the white people. I

toldyou about the incident of the restaurant. Segregation

in the restaurant.

L

No

HB Well, not long afterI had a regular job down there, why,

--Well, when I went down there, we could go in -- Black people

could go in the restaurant which was run by Union Pacific.

Go and sit wherever you wanted to sit in the restuarant, you

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s2:25 know. But one day, ah, the claim is that a Black porter came in there andinsulted one of the white waitresses. So the manage rof the restaurant -- He segregated the restaurant. Black people could just sit in one area. Well, the Red caps, they'd always been sitting right there at the counter and everyting. But. So. We went in there after the manager had made this declaration. And the waitress said, sorry, Ican't wait on you here. You'll have to sit over there. The manager, named Albers, why, he -- he had some trouble in here so he wants all of you people to sit over inthat area. I said, oh, is that
so- So I went and I said, where is Alberts. So I went to Albert ad talked to Albert. I said, they tell me you've segregated this place? He said, yes, I think it's best. He said, A Porter came in here and insulted Edna here. Theother day. And said, she was so upset, she didn't know what to do. I said, oh- Well, we'll have to look into this. nnd I said, because the Union Pacific doesn't sgegregate. So I went back. Ah, another Redcap and myself. We went back and we made out a petition. And had every Black employee: porters that were coming in from other states and everything. We had them to sign this petition and all the Blacks aroundthere that worked for the railroad signed the ~tititon. So we were getting this petition together to send back to Omaha, as Union Pacific headquarters was going to send it back to the superintendentof the dining care dept. Sothey found out about what we were doing. So I was home, one night, and along about twelve o'clock.

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s2:26
And they had sent some special agents to my house. Now, special agents, they were railroad policemen. Sent down to my house and they said, Howard, we'd like for you t come down to the depot and talk to Albers. He said, Albers wants to talk to you about this situation down there. At the restaurant. I said, I got nothing to say to Albers. I talked to Albers here the other day and found out about it. And they said, Well, just come on down and talk to him. I said, I ain't going nowhere tonight. I said, I'm coming to work tomorrow and if I feel like talking tohim tomorrow I'll talk to him, but I'm not coming down there tonight. They S3id, Well, ok, we can't make you come. So I went down there the next day. And. So, A1 berts had to send the special agents after me again. I was at work, though. So. I said, OK, I'll go in there and talk to him- So I went in and talked to him- And he said, Well, you know, that was a bad situation. So--insulting one of the wiatresses liek fuat, and it just creates a whole lot of trouble. I said, It sure has. And he said, well, you know, we never did have any trouble out of you Redcaps. He says, and so I want you to feel free to come in and sit where you have always been sitting. I said, You said us Redcaps. Do you mean to tell me my people that's coming in on these trains are going to still be segregated? "Well, we thnk it would be better that way. " I said, "Unless you wipe the slate clean and do away with all this segregation bit, as far as any Black is concerned, I don't even want to hear it!" So, I said, "In the first place, you know

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s2:27

good in well that Union Pacifici doesn't have any segregation."

And I said, "When I get this letter back to the superintendent

of the dining car dept., in Omaha, you're going to hear

moreabout this-" He said "Oh, don't do that, don't do that,"

he said. "Let's just forget the whole thing. Let's just

forget it." And I said, "Well, that's better."So, then I

went to his girl, Edna. I Said, "Edna, now you stirred

up all this crap." I said, "You made the complaint that

a Black man had insulted you by askingyou for a date."

"Oh, yes, I never had nothing like that happen to me

before in my life." I said, "What would you have done if

a white man had insulted you that way?" I said, "No,

you can't answer that. You wouldn't have done nothing. You

would have ignored it." And I said, Furthermore, I said,

"That aint the first Black man that asked you for a date

becuase youdated a Black man ebfore and I know that?" {Laughs}

So that was~ that was it. So ~at's where I started getting

the name of being troublemaker.

L

Wereyou risking your job at this time?

HB

Well, I didn't. I never even considered myself risking

my job because I felt like I was .. Anytme I thought I

was right, why, I never thought about the risk I was taking

on my job- Because I felt like I could get somehelp some

wheres, if I was right.

L

You mean you thought there'd be some people to back you

up.

HB

Yeah. some kind of way.

L

You know a lot of white people,I'm sure, don't know what

it feels lke to be segregated. What does it feel like

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s2:28

when you go into some place--

HS

Well, they make you feel less than a man when you do feel

like that you are as much a man as anybody else.

But, it looks like that they're trying to make you feel

less than a man. And that you're inferior. That used

to be part of the teaching in most of this country.

ThatBlacks were inferior to whites. And, I never did

believe it. And I wouldn't take it. Becuase I felt like

I was just as good as anybody in the world. I never felt

anyone was inferior to me and I don't want people to feel

that I'm inferior to them.

L

Soundslike it's hard to even talk about this today.

IT's been some years ago, without being angry still.

HS

Ahuh- Well, when I recall alot of these incidence, why,

some times I have a touch of anger, but then, I do

away with· that anger becuase I am - in most instances, I

accomplished something. So, one balances the other, see.

I don't hold that anger and that because

Now, if I

hadn't accomplished anything, why, I woul- just maybe die

angry {laughs sort}. In most instances that I know of,

why, I accomplished something.

L

Did that take care of the segregation? Was that the end

of the segregation inthat restauarant?

HB

Yes. Yeah, until they dosed the restaurant. Everyody

went wherever they --and sat wherever they wanted to sit.

L

But you had a reputation fromthat p:>int on?

HB

Ahuh. Yeah, because there was -- there was a white ticket _

agent that I considered a friend of mine. And he would

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s2:29

t~ll me alot of things that was going on, you know. And

we'd get to talking. Andhe's the one, Ibelieve, the first

one that told me that I had the reputation of being a

trouble maker down there.

L

doyou think that caused you any trouble. That got in the

way of maybe jobs that you could have gotten?

HS

No. No, because there weren't any other jobs I could

have gotten. Not at that time. Bee ~se I was in this

auxiliary union. All Blacks. And we couldn't bump anybody

on any of the other jobs. Didn't interfere with that.

L

LEt me ask you someting. At that time, you're talking about

a large and long ~riod of time. Acutally, before I ask

{interruption}

HS

Was we had a friend up - I had a friend up in the superin-

tendant's office that had a copy of a letter from the

head clerk down inthe north yard, stating that they didn't

want no Blacks down there in the North Yard office.

And a few other thingsin this letter. And he had the letter.

On file. Now, he was one of the head union guys of the

Brotherhood of Railway Clerks. But he was a friend of ours.

And, he showed.ls this letter. And so, No. He brought it

down so we could look at it. And I looked at it. And

this Jake Green, he looked at it. I said, Listen, JAke,

you stay here. You stay here in just a few minutes. I'm

going to take this up and get a phostatic copy made of

it. AndI werlt up and had a photostatic copy madeof it.

- And the guy that give it to us, this union guy, he didn't

know nothing about this, you know. So, whe I brought it

Howard BRowne 9-19-83 s2:30

back, why then Jake took it, took the origianl back

up to him. So he didn't know we had a copy of it. So I pre-

sented that in court.

L

How did that help.

HB

Well, it showedthe prejudice and the feeling that -- of

the white mn taht we were working around. And would have

to work with.

L

Showed that there was something behind their keeping you

gusy out.

HB

Yeah. And this~ was one of the head union guys. He was

chief clerk down there in the North yards, said, we don't

want them Blacks down here!

L

thatmust have been an uncomfortable job for you to work in.

HB

Oh, this. Oh, this is This is what I wrote to Boyd

He was Equal Employement Officerin Alberqueque New Mexico.

This is just, I wrote this out by hand. And then I had it

typewritten.

L

You know, you went thorugh so much troule down there with

Union Pacific. Why did you stay with the job?

HB

Well, I'd been there a long time. And then Ihad a bt

of benefits. With the Union Pacific. I had railroad passes.

I belonged to the hospital association which I still

belong to. And my wife belongs to it, too. See, if she

hadn't belonged to that hospital association, all this

operation and everything, boy,we never would have been able

to pay for it. So, there was a lot of benefits and pension.

See, I draw railroad pension.

L · sothere's something to work for?

HB

Ahuh- And so close to retirement so many years in there and

Howard Browne 9-19-83 s2:31

I've been taking it all the time. So, -- Nothing new,

you know. Ah, ther's when I retired. NOw, this is

signedby this Hawkett, this guy that disqualified me.

And all fuat kind of stuff. Now, when I retired, that's

the ltter he wrote to me. Ha-ha. Now, and here's a

letter I got-- Leonard Carter, he was regtonal

director of the NAACP. And I went back to New York and

filed a complaint with the NAACP also. And that's the

reply from somebody. {shuffling thorugh papers; HB's voice

sounds different}

So, see, we were trying to hit them from ~ery angle.

We didn't know which way to go, but we were trying.

Oh, here's a note from that woman that bumped me.

She had a 59 date.

In one bunch of papers, I had that thing that didn't

want no blacks down therein Union--down there in Union

PAcific.

L

That statement.

HB

YEah. I think

L

Let me ask you this- You know, you were deemed by ~e

whitesof Union Pacific as a trouble maker pretty much felt you
because you spoke your mind. And becuase you/had a right

to be treated fairly. Equally.

HB

I demanded to be treated like anybody

--{Tape increases in speed} If a~ybody mistreated me, even the superintendent.
{too fast right off the tape almost}
