 THE FOLLOWING IS AN INTERVIEW WITH ROBERT ANDERSON, CONDUCTED BY HARRY HENSLICK, ON AUGUST 1 5 , 1 9 7 1 AT THE ANDERSON'S HOME I N COL OR A DO. [ T H I S I S P A R T OF THE UR A NIUM H I S T O R Y P R O J E C T ]
HH: This morning I don't want to bother you for too long, I have a couple other small questions I want to ask you about, but I would really appreciate it if we could have you tell as best you know, the history of the company. This is some of the roots it came from and maybe about when major changes came in the corporation and how it became VCA and what happened to it in '67 and thereabouts. So do you want to start in on that, I'd be very happy.
RA: I believe the original start of it in this area was Primos Chemicals, probably in 1903, 1904 in the Placerville area. A vanadium deposit was located, I'm not sure by who or anything like that. This time there was three mills built on the Bear Creek, the Bear Creek area, all for vanadium or whatever. I believe all these mills
HH: RA:
burnt, destroyed by fire. I'm sure that the first two were.
And that was all, those were al~ Primos Chemical plants. Yeah, well, I believe probably towards the last it might
have been Vanadium Corporation. I'm not sure, but Mr. Sterling was very active towards the last back there. And some of his correspondence is on Vanadium stationery. I don't know just how this wove together, but they were
also vanadium deposits found in Peru that was very rich

 BOB ANDERSON
and produced, supplied vanadium for a good number of years. Just how they merged or what they merged, or what happened I do not know. But I found a letter one day from Denny Viles telling his crew in the Bear Creek area about a safety precaution to protect, and that was on Vanadium stationery which was quite old. I forget the date, it was a safety precaution put in on the inside. I'm sure this was Vanadium stationery here. This letter was good, been under glass or something like this, well preserved. So he give it to me. After the fire in 1918 or something like that. This was the end of the operation the Bear Creek area. At a later date, why, apparently they bought, loaned one of the uranium companies some money.
HH: Standard Chemical?
RA: No, Standard Chemical was the other one. The one that
Carbide owned. HH: Rare Metals?
RA: Yea, Rare Metals. This is where we acquired the mill site here.
HH: What happened, apparently they foreclosed on the loan? RA: I believe it was a foreclosure. That's how we arrived,
only some of it was, most of our claims were in the Uravan Mineral Belt and also the mill site, the Rare Metals mill site. Forty-three, I think they done a little work. They done some work before this, but '43 they done a little metallurgic work on a type of concentrated

 BOB
DERSON
effects of the ore down at Mexican Hat and also here. I don't think they were too successful, and then of course, they came back in production again in '49 looking for uranium. Housing was built in the 1940s, housing and also
at that time the mill. A good deal of the ore was from the Placerville area, Dove Creek, Fall Creek and Mountain Creek struck in their minerals. At that time was a man by the name of Blitz.
Is that Baxter? What?
Is that Baxter Blitz's father?
Father, yes. He was in charge there. Later Mr. Viles was the head, probably for the best history of what happened i t would be him.
I'm sure, I'm sure that's true.
He was moved out here 1916, 1917, 1918 and then he come back in '40.
He was here in the teens approximately and then--
Yeah, he was, he was here as a very young man. I think he lived---?--- vanadium up there for a number of years. And retired as a teacher or school teacher up there. Too bad that you can't get a little more accurate.
The Peru properties, as far as you know, did the VCA own those from the time they were discovered in the First War or did they gain these from someone else?
They got in through somebody else. I'm not positive, but
HH: RA: HH: RA:
HH: RA:
HH: RA:
HH:
RA:

 BOB ANDERSON
I believe Henry Ford did a lot of work, or done th original work in Peru and he had something to do with it. He was in many fields, not just cars. He just happened, I remember how the company was drawn in.
HH: About when did the company have this property in Peru? Do you know?
RA: This was must have started sometime in the '20s, because they were controllers of the market all through the '30s and '50s--very high grade material.
HH: When was the last ore taken out of there for the VCA? RA: out of Peru?
HH: Uh huh.
RA: They were still operating in '50 down there when I went
to work for the company. So they probably, it's been the late ¥sos when they moved out. It could have been pretty close into the 1960s when they moved out. It could have been pretty close into the 1960s still operating there. It wasn't a very large operation.
HH: Did they actually more or less run out of ore there?
RA: Oh, I've heard all kinds of reports on the thing. Some think there is some low grade down there and some think
it's pretty well worked out. It's an open pit and I believe they got to the bottom bed as far down as they could go unless they widened it, and they went underground and done a little development work
underground. A pparently i t w asn't too successful.

 BOB ANDERSON
Basically all the highgrade has been emptied. There' not too much low grade. It's a high operation cost, it would have to be a pretty good ore to operate it at that altitude where they have to handle it.
What happened to that property? Did VCA keep it?
HH: RA: HH: RA: HH: RA: HH: RA:
HH:
I believe this was turned back to the government. To Peru?
To Peru, yeah.
Do you have any idea when that might have happened? It could be four or five years ago.
Sixty-six, '67.
If I'm not mistaken, they decided to get completely out. I believe this is quite a problem on the back.
Wel1, now you didn't say much about in the '6Os and around '67 now. What happened with the VCA properties and why did it occur?
You mean in 1 67?
Yes.
RA:
HH:
RA: The big thing was the government notified in '58 they'd
no longer buy any ore unless you had a reserve that was known at that time, October such and such a date, '58. Then they made this announcement and this naturally caused everybody to slow up their development. Nobody
went out and looked for any reserves to speak of. Back then whatever you had developed you could sell it to the government and anything after this, why, you couldn't. It

 BOB ANDERSON
took quite awhile to work out your reserves but the AEC come in and took all your records, get hold of anything else and worked out the amount of tonnage you could sell
them. During this time that this was happening, why development was at a standstill. There just wasn't any reason to go out and drill. Everybody was of the opinion that it was quite a way down the road before there'd be any commercial market. Everybody was of the opinion that a commercial market was quite a ways off. Vanadium wasn't selling too good, wasn't at too good a price. In 1963, why we was developing the mills in Durango,--concentrator here. At that time decided to get out of the surplus area. There was a little reserve on the Reservation which would help us and government pound of uranium and we were short, to run our mill and they were short to run their mill, so we just bought deposition and this give us enough pounds to run on. Enough to show the government and this actually, the lack of development finally caught up with high cost of lack of elements, lack of interest in the vanadium market. Shiprock closed and high cost of acid. Vanadium could be purchased on the open market for 95 dollars, couldn't be made for the cost of producing it. So therefore we--Climax was in the same position. Not enough ore to run their mills at full capacity but it was
a little better haul. So it was natural for us to--with one too many mills or two too many mills in the area. So

 BOB ANDERSON
we just let them have our properties to operate and which didn't last too long. The same thing caught up for them. Vanadium wasn't--they wasn't getting too much for the vanadium and very little for the uranium, the cost of
HH:
RA:
HH: RA:
HH:
RA:
labor and everything, squeeze. Just no money in operating for the amount of--
When did the, what was the last year of operation at the mill? That VCA had, the one at Durango, the one here. The one at Durango operated until '63, March of '63. The
first day of March is when we moved to Shiprock. So it run, cleaned up after. The same time the concentrator at Naturita was closed.
And how long did the Shiprock operate then before?
It would be two years ago, a year I guess before we allowed the property over to Climax. So the first part of
'68 it started slowing down.
How did Foote Minerals get involved and when did they get involved with the property?
Well, of course, by the time they shut down there was no one at Shiprock, why no one at Foote Minerals. This was
purely a merger. The Vanadium Corporation and Foote Minerals. I think at this time, this day and age, this is the thing to do, is merge with somebody else. This is what it seems to be, what seems to be happening. I do not know why it become Foote Minerals instead of Vanadium Corporation. It could have been called either one of

 BOB ANDERSON them.
HH: Or perhaps both of them.
RA: Well, they probably could have worked out some name with
Foote and Vanadium. They're both old companies. Of course, I believe Vanadium Corporation, naturally with the name Vanadium Corporation was better known than Foote but it depends what business you're in.
HH: According to the press releases of the last week or so, what has taken place just recently with Foote Minerals property?
RA: We are at the present time negotiating a lease or sublease whatever you want to call it, with Union Carbide as operator of mining property, and they will be the operators of the lease, sublease or arrangements.
HH: Apparently they need more reserves in ore?
RA: I'm sure any mill is hungry. Never was a mill that had enough ore. So they'll all operate and then this certainly is one way to do it. The big ones finally lead the industry, it's what it amounts to in any mining
claim--the consolidation of property.
HH: Perhaps it's coming to that point now?
RA: Whether there will be enough property in the area for
anybody else to come in will the sixty-four dollar question. Naturally I'd like to see another mill in the area. I don't like to see one in the area, one payroll
camp. This is what usually happens.

 BOB ANDERSON
HH: As far as you know, this lease agreement if it carried
through completely, will that be a long-term thing or
will it be yearly renewable or how might it be handled? RA: Term and everything is being discussed.
HH: Uh huh. They're still up in the air about it.
RA: I, myself, I can't see very attractive mining areas for
uranium due to the small profits and the high cost of mining. And increased ventilation--we just cannot compete in this area with mineral deposits in Wyoming, New Mexico and in Canada uranium. Why, it's not very attractive area and the only thing that makes it interesting is the vanadium. If there's a better source or another source of uranium, of vanadium, why I'm sure that Union Carbide or
somebody else would move out of the area very fast. Course, today there's not, no one in any place where they can get the vanadium any easier. Probably before too long, we' 11 mine, we' 11 have some other source here. Iron ore, this is producing vanadium now. There's type of ore in the United States, Canada has some, Wyoming has some. So I wouldn't be a bit surprised if--of course there's a great possibility for vanadium in Arkansas. Carbide's
Arkansas for instance, has very large reserves and if they ever get their milling problems settled, why they can probably help produce vanadium ore.
HH: They have quite a reserve, but they have problems with milling?

 BOB ANDERSON
RA: I understand that the Colorado Plateau is not the b st
area for low-cost mining. But it has supplied a lot of vanadium and a lot of uranium. Probably find some where we're at. I imagine that all the bigger companies that would look at the, decided not to come into the Plateau for their--very little of the major people stayed here after spending a little money. They might come in the early days and looked around and left. And some of the oil companies just recently spent a little money in this
area and they decided to go other places.
HH: Let me ask you just a little bit about the East and West
Vancoram. You say that 1940 was it, that this area--
RA: I believe it was 1940.
HH: And then what, West Vancoram later?
RA: I don't know. It was run by the government. This has been
built probably a little sooner but not too much.
HH: Now most of these properties were VCA.
RA: The ground was VCA's. West Vancoram was built by the
government. The government housing project. HH: I see.
RA: VCA owned the ground.
HH: I was going to ask you what has happened with these
properties today. Have they been sold to individuals? RA: West Vancoram after the government advertised them for sale, they were supposed to be torn down according to rules and regulation, this was temporary housing. But

 BOB ANDERSON
they still felt the housing would be used in areas, so they offered it up for bid and the company agreed if
somebody wants to continue to operate it they would sell
them. By the time the government owned it why-- HH: So it was sold.
RA: The fellow elected to lease it, to maintain the housing the area instead of tear it down. So he bought the, I believe back, to keep the housing on that's one of these advertisements surplus from the government that everybody could bid on. Somebody from Pennsylvania.
HH: About when was that sold?
RA: This must have been at '68.
HH: And what is the story of this area then?
RA: This is still owned by the company.
HH: It just went with Foote Minerals.
RA: Foote Minerals runs it, rents the houses. Public rental
I guess you'd call it.
HH: I was going to ask you if people from outside the company
live in some of these.
RA: There's not enough company people available to keep the
houses full, so we've been renting it for quite some time actually, it's been rented. I believe '58 or something like that, we moved out of Naturita, why after that it's
been rented to the general public.
HH: It is pretty reasonable housing as compared to what you
might find elsewhere in the area?

 BOB ANDERSON
RA:
HH: RA: HH: RA:
HH: RA:
HH:
RA:
HH:
RA:
HH:
RA:
Oh, housing is very tight in this area. We' e certainly not making any money out of the rental. I don't have any idea what the company is. The worse thing in the world to own is a bunch of houses. It's a nice location, that
about all I can say about the housing.
How many houses are there just right here?
Seventeen.
Seventeen.
There's supposed to be 18 but one of them was never built
for some reason.
I didn't realize there were quite that many here.
With the other ones there's four rooms, three rooms, four room, three room standard across it. on the very far end there's still a location there, there is the original designs for houses. It would be a home district.
Of course this is the palace of snob hill would be this one here.
Yea, this is for the superintendent.
It's quite comfortable really. It's nice.
Never lived in.
Was this Denny's house for awhile?
Yes, he managed the houses and stayed here and lived here a little while. Mostly we just kept the tax movements for a day or two.
HH: Well, I want to thank you again for talking to me today and--

  BOB ANDERSON
RA: I wished I could be more help to you, but Ir ally - HH: You've been a lot of help.
RA: I don't remember just what did happen in the early days.

 THE FOLLOWING IS AN INTERVIEW WITH MR. ROBERT ANDERSON, CONDUCTED BY GARY L. SHUMWAY AND HARRY HENSL CK, AT EAST VANCORAM ON AUGUST 21, 1971. [THIS IS PART OF THE URANIUM HISTORY PROJECT)
GS: Mr. Anderson, it's really good to be here with you this morning. We have looked forward to visiting with you and we didn't know you were going to have such a pleasant
surprise for us in this volume of Geological Records . And as we begin this session, why don't you tell us a little bit about your own background, beginnings, and how you happened to get in the industry, you know.
RA: Well, personally I went to work for the Vanadium Corporation of America in 1950. Before this time, my experience was mining and milling, gold and silver mostly. During the -depression why I worked gold camp, Summerville Consolidated Mines, it's on the other side of the Continental Divide near Del Norte. This was a very high altitude, about 12,000 ft. I got married and my wife
was, well, just wasn't able to live up there. So we moved to Creede silver property and I worked there until 1950 when I went to work for the company. I started to work for them as a foreman at Roscoelite property and spent the winter at what is known as Graysville, and at the end of the winter, why Mr. Viles moved me out of there and
put me in charge of Monument and Spudpatch and Bland i ng, Marysvale and everything. It was working out of Durango at the time. That's where my headquarters was, Durango, East Reservation, West Reservation, Coal, Monument and

 ROBERT ANDERSON 12
this type of thing. I worked there until 1953 when we moved over here to take over the mines in this general vicinity and I stayed there until 1957 when they closed the mill in Naturita, when I moved back over to Durango. This wasn't too successful. There was so much traveling,
I finally moved back here where I was more centralized .
and now I'm general mine superintendent and other operations when we close down. Basically, my duties has been all connected with the mining and I've had very little to do with the milling or anything like that. Mainly just mine areas have been my responsibility.
GS: Where were you born?
RA: I was born in Idaho. My father was a metallurgist. He
worked in Nevada, Idaho and then before he came back to Colorado, he was in charge of all things, he was an engineer on the project to drill the Everglades in Miami, Florida. After he had, well this job, why he was contacted and hired mill superintendent at Rifle Vanadium Plant, this was United States Vanadium before Union
Carbide or U.S. Vanadium, or however you want to say it, purchased it. This was owned by some individuals, I think three people and one of his names was Bunker, Arthur Bunker and there was a Blackwell and I'm not sure who the third owner was, but these three gentlemen owned this. Bunker was the leader of the group. He seemed to be the
2

 ROBERT ANDERSON #2
operator of the group, and I believe he's some relation to the Bunker now that's in Saigon.
GS: Is he any relation to Cecil Bunker?
RA: No, no, these are all Eastern, Harvard graduates. He was
head of the war production or something in the war production. He was in charge of that mostly during the war and became quite a noted person. He ended up, I think he retired as President of Climax. Climax where they purchased African stuff and all this together. And upon sale, this must have been in 1927, or '28, they sold this Rifle mill and mine to Union Carbide is what it amounts to. And at that time why they built a larger mill there and my father continued to operate this as mill superintendent until they shut it down in 1932, the spring of '32 they shut the mill down.
GS: Why did they shut it down?
RA:
Depression and they stored all their vanadium from 1929 to about this time on the property. There was no market and the reason they continued to operate the mine and the mill during the depression was because mines at that time were thought to be at that time, or the reserves was
almost depleted and they figured it would be cheaper to continue to mine and deplete the reserves and stockpile the product than it would be to reopen the mine at some later date. And so they worked out this, and this was in
3

 ROBERT ANDERSON #2
the upper ore body and I think it was pretty well worked out, but, of course, there's probably been ten times the ore found there since, but this wasn't the same mine,
GS: RA:
GS: HH: RA: GS:
it's a continuation of down dip type of thing. And after that, why he went to Idaho, done a little assaying, gold mining up in Salmon River country, Boise Basin Country and then finally ended up back in the uranium business where he retired from VCA in Durango and was manager over there for, till he retired. Has been in the vanadium business for quite a long time. There's a specimen up there on the top shelf up there, vanadium oxide. That was about 1927. It kind of has a--this is the fused, this is the finished product. We got that from the mill and it was something that grew on top of one of the pigs that was poured and it kind of has a bookend effect.
Sure does.
It kind of looks like a sailing ship or something and is
probably one of the few old specimens of vanadium you could find. I think it was probably milled in 1927. Before USV was taken over by Union Carbide.
About how pure is this, do you think?
Oh, I imagine 89% or better.
This is what would be called fused vanadium? Fused black, yeah.
RA:
GS: What is the difference between this and ferro vanadium?
4

 ROBERT ANDERSON # 2
RA: Ferro vanadium, why they put in, they put this nan
electric furnace with iron and it is, ferro is about 50% iron and 50% vanadium, in a little bit more sol uble form, I think. But this is the finished product from these t ype of mills here.
GS: It does come out as fused black, like this?
RA: That's what they chipped there, chipped and crushed.
That's quite an old specimen.
HH: What's the difference between this and red cake?
RA: Red is not fused. All the red is forged here, we did have
a lot of water in it and all they do is heat it, melt it and draw the water off. Pan cake would be 205 and red cake is 205 plus a lot of water and crystallization. This would just be 205.
HH: Why do they ship the red cake today from these mills? RA: Ah, for chemical uses. It has some uses in the chemical field, the air-dried red cake is, there's a few people,
customers that use this. I don't know who makes it today. Let's see, possibly Carbide does. I don't know who makes the air-dried now. But there is a small market for the red cake in the chemical, the chemical field, if not in
the steel, in the manufacturing of steel.
GS: Do you know what the market is? What kind of chemical
use? Is it just research, experimentation?
RA: No, no, no, no. This is quite a bit bigger. Monsanto was
5

 ROBERT ANDERSON # 2
one of the large purchasers of red cake and it s used as a catalyst or something.
GS: However, most of the ore shipped from say the Naturita mill would go as fused black.
RA: Most of today's vanadium is fused black and Carbi de , I think, ships it as a 203 or something like this, i nst ead of black, I think it's black yet, but with valence, reduced valence. They ship it in a milk carton, milk can and I think this is a small amount type of thing, and this is so the air won't keep oxidation from taking place
in these containers. But most of the ore today is fused
black. This is used to make ferro out of mostly.
HH: Um-hum. Now, what is the exact process for injecting ferro vanadium in making vanadium steel? When is this
done? During the, what process of steel making, do you
know?
RA: I think they put this in an open hearth furnace, but
that's getting a little out of my field. As I understand it, why these new products that they have come out with recently, solvan and carban, and this is used for structural steel. This is put in at a pound or two pounds per ton of iron. Then this increases the strength, the carrying load of this steel tremendously. Maybe 40%. You can use this much less steel and build the same size of
building.
6

 ROBERT ANDERSON # 2
HH: RA:
Is this a new alloy?
No it's a, made in an electric furnace and Carbide come out with the original and they called it carban and then we came out with one and we called solvan. It's more
soluble than this is used for making of structural steel, where the ferro alloy, I think, is more for tool steel, and this kind of stuff. When you go to ferro, why you're putting in 50% pig to 50% iron and 50% vanadium and this
is, you're getting up there at maybe 3 or 4 or 5% vanadium in the steel and this is where you use your tool steel, and your real good grades of ---
cutlery.
Yes, cutlery and this type of thing, similar to stainless, stainless doesn't have any vanadium in it but this is used for this stuff and the other way, why this cheaper product, you don't use as much as this more soluble solvan and carban, and this is used strictly, I think, in building structural steel grade.
In other words, a pound or two of solvan will actually
GS: RA:
GS:
increase the tensile strength of your steel.
RA: This is my understanding of it.
GS: About 40%?
RA: I think this is it, it really increases, and this is why
the usage of vanadium has went up quite a bit in the last five or six years is due to this use in structural and
7

 ROBERT ANDERSON #2
it's so much cheaper if you put in a little bit o vanadium and then cut the amount of steel in the size of the beams.
How much would a pound of solvan sell for? Do you know? How much does it sell for? I think now two something and
GS:
RA:
GS:
RA:
GS:
RA:
GS: RA:
it just went up recently. Ferro always was about three or four dollars so I suppose it's below three. Ferro's much harder to make, I think, much costlier
to make. It's harder, but it's more costly.
And you also need to use a much greater amount in the steel making.
Yea, it's the different grades of vanadium steel. I see some of them up to 5% for special usage whereas the solvan or carban, as I understand it is they don't use too much. The cost is not very great and the return is terrific.
Are there any of the other alloys that can compete in, for structural steel, say molybdenum, or ferro- chrome, on well not ferro-chrome but chromium?
I think they all compete. I think they, most of them is
superior.
But for structural steel, for the--
I'm not sure about that. I think vanadium has an edge on that. As far as the rest of it, as far as the ferro, why
most all your moly and your titan are the same, the same 8

 ROBERT ANDERSON # 2
thing. Actually the molybdenum is probably just a lit le bit the best or little more widely used. I don't know i
GS:
RA:
it's the best or not, but it's more widely used.
Was this an important factor in the 1930s, as far as the overall market was concerned? The fact that there were
other competitive products?
I think that originally, probably, vanadium was the leader and then they lost out, would be my idea of it. Vanadium, actually was the first leader because moly just, actually just done more research, the molybdenum people down there did all kinds of research. They developed their market, they really developed their market. It's just fantastic, the market they have developed.
Is there a great deal of research going on today in the vanadium?
I'm sure there is some, I don't know how much. There never has been the research, I don't believe, in the
HH:
RA:
vanadium that there has been in the moly.
GS: VCA, actually during most of this period, actually was the leading world producer of vanadium. Is that correct?
RA: That is right.
GS: And they had this huge mine. I mean, this Rigger up there
in Peru. Do you have any idea why there wasn't a more aggressive policy, at least as far as research goes?
9

 ROBERT ANDERSON #2
RA: Boy, you're really putting me on the spo My own
personal opinion, and this is just from observing, vanadium always has been, there's always been a great demand for it or no demand. It seems like it's just up and down. Everybody wants it, or nobody wants it. I believe the fact that the management had went through these periods of either feast or famine so many times
that, as we say, you just got to be able to turn it on like a faucet. And this is awfully hard to do on a mine and so I think some of the management went through two or three of these turn-ans and turn-offs and they just did not keep up their reserves. There's no question about it, who made the money. In this area, why the Vanadium Corporation sold all their uranium at top price and my personal observation was that the other company at the time wasn't too interested in selling their own. They were interested in buying and they could buy their custom ore but they wasn't depleting their property, they were still holding them and of course, they're in business now, and the Vanadium Corporation is out of it. There was no thought of purchasing any properties or anything like this. If you could mine it today, why you could take the property on, but if it took some development, why they just didn't think there would be a market for it in a few years. Basically, I think uranium's the thing around here
10

 ROBER ANDERSON #2
and I think the management felt as though that omorrow the AEC was going to call up and say, we don't need any more uranium, don't send us any. And I think they lived
GS: RA:
in fear of this due to the fact that they had seen these ups and down in the vanadium market so many times. I think the management, the local management, felt tomorrow's the end.
With the 1970 deadline or even earlier?
Oh, this was the 1953 deadline. I think this was very much in his mind, that tomorrow he would have had it. And truthfully he was right. We got all we need. It's running out of our ears and yet they're still buying it. You can go down to Grand Junction, if you want to see some barrels of uranium, just drive down to the Commission. Are those full of uranium?
They're full of uranium.
There's a batch of them.
I haven't seen that.
I'm not sure just how much there is there. I think there's 35,000 tons. I think this is what there is stored right there. There's 50,000 tons all over the country. This will probably do us for a while.
Yeah, but at the rate they're using now, this will do it for a long while. There's got to be some change, or we're going to be back at the time of that report. Certainly,

 ROBERT ANDERSON #2
going to have to be some kind of change as far as I see
it. They want more fuel and that's it, uranium, with
coal, there's very much contamination of the atmosphere. GS: What about the breeder reactors, now are they going to
play a big part eventually?
RA: Well, this certainly will cut down the amount of uranium
needed.
GS: But it's still in the future?
RA: It's still in the future and I think they, from my
understand of it, don't they have to have fuel for these
older reactors type to start on?
HH: They use a fuel, but actually--
RA: Nah, I think they use the spent fuel of these, don't
they? Of today's reactors?
GS: They can enrich, they can take this and enrich it, I
know but--
'
RA: But this fuel here, it's already been started and I think this is one of the things why haven't been too fast on the breeder reactor. I think because they wouldn't have the source of fuel until these second generation reactors that we're now on, if they know, why, people would be just as scared of the breeder reactor as they would of
this type of reactor, it's as dangerous as anything.
GS: At the end of World War II the two large companies seemed to share the same feeling that everybody else, it wasn't
12

 ROBERT ANDERSON #2
just them, but everyone seemed to almost give up for a
RA:
time on uranium. Can you tell us why they did this?
I think it was purely the market. There was no market at the time. During the war, I don't think there was any profit for any of them in the uranium end of it. Hauled tailings down from here, down to Uravan, and as far as I know, all, all the profit there was, in the haul and maybe they made a couple of cents or maybe they lost a little, probably lost a little, if the truth is known, on the haul this tailing pile from Naturita. Some of the figures I have seen, some of the old reports on the prices of uranium while they was taking it out there was
very, very low. I think it was just a matter of the
market that nobody wanted to buy any.
GS: . In other words, they assumed this would be the price if
RA: GS:
RA:
there was a price for it, this would be it.
It was very, very low.
Do you think that the company, having the Monument #2 and realizing how long this would last, you know, in the
market given, the past market, do you think they assumed this would supply the world needs for a while?
I doubt very much that anyone really knew what Monument #2 reserves was like during this time, it was a lot later
than this, before there was any thought of Monument #2 being very large.

By 1945 they had no idea?
No, in 1945, why they probably bought it for that price, the ridiculous price the company paid for it to start with.
They just really didn't know that there was that much
there at that time.
No, it was much, much later than that.
When did they turn that into an open pit operation?
In 1954.
When you came in 1950, did you say you were in charge of the reservation?
Yes, Monument was the first place there that was turned over to me.
Were you aware of the immensity of that in 1950?
I certainly was not. It was a good mine.
Was that after Everett Blackburn had had that operation? Do you remember?
I'm not so sure that Everett was ever down there. Your friend Bert Estes was down there. He had a lease down there, and couldn't find anywhere to mine. But I don't remember Everett being down there.
He talked about being, he didn't call it superintendent, but something between that and lead man over the leases on the reservation for VCA.
RA: Well, he probably was on the other East and West
14

Reservation.
But not that you know on the mine?
I'm not positive of this, but I'm not so sure Everett had really anything to do with Monument, at least for very long periods. He might have had for a short while, but it couldn't have been for long. The resident down there was Bell, Carl Bell, in '50 and before him was Dean Bartley.
HH: Are they still there? Carl Bell or--?
RA: No, Carl's dead. His wife lives in Bernock. Bartley, Dean
Bartley, I think is still around. You might find him over at, around Dove Creek someplace. And before that, I think Bert was down there.
GS: And Donald still lives here in Naturita.
RA: Yeah, Donald still lives here. But Bert was down there
and then Bartley was next and Bell. There could have been, Everett could have been down there in the early part of '43 and in through there. It's possible. At that time the tonnage was very, very small.
HH: When the huge amount of ore taken out per day which eventually came from Monument, didn't come until the
middle ¥sos is that right, until after the open pit?
RA: I don't think the open pit had too much to do with the tonnage that came out of there. Most of the ore was mined actually underground and the pit wasn't started early
enough and it was mostly a clean-up operation, but mining 15

 ROBERT ANDERSON #2
was ahead of the stripping.
GSá You came in 1950 and how long did you remain?
RA: Until July of '53 on that end of the thing.
GS: During that time did you see the development of it? The
actual opening up of the mine?
RA: During this time was when it began to really boom and
into the, nothing that I done, but it was just the sequence of events that it began to really enlarge and my tonnage, my quota when I was there putting in was 100 tons a day. And when I left why I was expected about 3 or 4 hundred.
HH: Did it get any larger than that, tonnage?
RA: Yeah, I imagine it increased to about five hundred.
GS: Was there anything, was there a breakthrough where you
RA:
really fell into it, or was there a gradual increase in tonnage?
I don't believe anybody really realized the magnitude of it before '51, and then it started to develop and I don't believe they understood the value, the original, there
was no hopes of ever being clear through the whole thing. There was a little on the South Rim, a little on the Northern Rim, a couple of spots in the middle and this was it, and I don't believe that they connected the channel clear through the property on the lower zone.
How large was that lease when you were down there? Had it 16
HH:

 ROBERT ANDERSON # 2
increased to the largest that it was to go?
RA: Well, this is the original company property staked by Rex Morrison, forty acres.
GS: They decreased that at one time didn't they?
RA: No, no, they never decreased that. This was mai n Monument
#2 property.
GS: The entire channel there, this is all they ever had?
RA: Later, why we got ground along both sides of us and
across the canyon and across both North and South rim. But the original VCA block was forty acres. Cato Sells located around on both sides. Climax, Pitkin were all of Cato Sells' outfit. In fact, what Cato did was lease everyplace that the company had some ground, why he just located on both sides of it.
GS: Why didn't VCA take this whole channel that was laying out there? Why didn't they take the whole thing? Why just forty acres in the middle?
RA: It's my understanding that the tribe wanted to keep these acres here, to different companies and individuals as little as possible. They were very much concerned that
they didn't want somebody to have a lot of acreage, and so they kept them as small as they could and they done a very, very good job of it. They didn't miss very much of it. And at the time, why, they probably thought they were taking a little over. As it turned out, why they missed
17

 ROBERT ANDERSON # 2 a little.
GS: So had this been a Navajo tribal decision to have it Just forty acres or had the company realizing that the Navajo tribe wanted it to--
RA: I think the tribe had instructed the company that they couldn't have too many acres and they had other leases and that the acreage was getting up there fairly high and I think forty acres, they could have probably made it
fifty if they wanted to, but I think if they asked for 1,000 they would have been in trouble.
