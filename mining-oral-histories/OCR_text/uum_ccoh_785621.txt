GETTING COLD.
TODAY IS NOVEMBER 12, 1993. IT'S SNOWING OUTSIDE AND
EM: Mr. Barnett can you tell me where you came from before you moved to Utah?
KB: It was a coal camp near Knoxville, Iowa.
EM: Was that a...
KB: It was a slope mine. Yah, it was about five miles from
Knoxville, about like Price.
EM: I see and did they have other mines in that area?
KB: Yah, there's two or three other mines.
EM: I didn't even know that Iowa had mines to tell you the
truth.
KB: They ain't got the coal we got here. I would say that
Utah has the best bituminous coal in the United States. EM: Is that right? Well you would probably know having worked
in both places.
KB: Yah, I worked fifty years in the coal mines.
EM: How many?
KB: Fifty.
EM: Is that right! What year did you come to Utah?
KB: 1947.
EM: 1947? Did you come before your brother John?
KB: John came when the war was on.
OB: I think it was forty-five, because I think it was two
years later that we come.
EM: I see. John just kind of told you about what was going on

 out here ...
KB: Well, and they (some Utah mining recruiters) came back
EM: KB: EM:
EM:
KB: EM: OB: CM: OB:
EM: OB: EM: KB:
there looking for experienced miners. There were quite a few experienced miners in Iowa. Then some came from Wyoming. The Lowe (last name) people know they came from Arkansas. They were experienced miners.
Oh, they had worked in the mines in Arkansas?
Oh yah?
See, I didn't even know there are mines in Arkansas. I thought there were some in Pennsylvania and Utah.
So you came here in 1947? What was the size of your family at that time?
We already had our family: five of them.
Okay and that was who?
We had six children, but one of them died.
What are their names?
Thelma is the oldest, she lives in Orem at this time. Floyd and Albert is our boys, they live in California. The twins live in Sandy, Utah and their names is Judy and Joan.
They were all born in Iowa?
Yes.
What kind of work did you do in the mine Kendall? Shoveled coal. We got tonnage. You see we formed a union
there too. The Union was there long before it was here. Anyway, when Andy started bossing up here, he asked me how to get out more coal. I said, "Tonnage". See they

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
got... You know Carl Orton don't you?
EM: Yes. Carl Orton.
KB: ---?--- the Coal Operator Association. They wanted all
OB:
hourly they didn't want to pay us tonnage. The coal (production) dropped. I told Andy the only way to get extra tonnage is to pay by the ton, then the men will
work.
I was going to tell you that we had six children, we did, but we lost one before we come out here. So we just brought five with us and raised them.
EM: What were your opinions about coming out here after living in Iowa?
OB: I didn't like it at first, but I went down to the store (Price Trading Company) wi'th Nell. Shortly after we got
EM: OB: CM:
here and Prince what's his name? Francis Prince said, "What do you think of this country or what do you think of it here, or would you rather be in God's country?" I said, "Right now I would rather be in God's country." I was so homesick. Everything was green and pretty back there and here it was bare and dry and I didn't like it
at first, but it growed on me.
Were you born and raised in Iowa?
Oh yes.
So if you left there with five children? What kind of car did you have? How did you make it here with the five
3

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT children?
OB: We sold our car before we left Iowa and came out on the bus.
KB: We had a model A Ford. That was a good car. That was the worst mistake that Ford made when they quite making them.
CM: That's right . They were good cars.
EM: Easy to fix.
KB: They would have been competition against Japan and
EM: CM:
OB: CM: OB:
CM: OB:
EM: OB: KB:
CM:
Germany.
Yah.
So when you came out on the bus, you couldn't bring much with you.
No.
So what did you bring?
Well just our clothes and stuff and then we shipped the other to the depot in Hiawatha, our dishes and bedding and stuff.
Then where did you live in Hiawatha at first?
We lived with John and Nell for sometime. We sure had a house full.
That was up in East Hiawatha?
Yes.
Then we got a house up around the circle there in East Hiawatha .
You didn't live in the Flat Tops when you first got here?
4

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
KB: No, John did.
OB: Our oldest daughter (Thelma) was working for the
EM:
OB:
EM: c: OB:
EM:
OB: KB:
principal of the high school there in Iowa, so she stayed till fall. Then she came out on the train. Then she got a job shortly after that.
I see. What were the ages of your kids when they came out here?
Thelma graduated that year, she was eighteen I remember that. The other kids I don't know. How old do you suppose Floyd was? (to Ona)
Is he your age Carole?
He is older I guess. Is he older then Pearl (a niece)? No, he is younger. Floyd was born in 1936 and Albert in 1938, the twins were born in 1943.
So what was the difference between the houses in Iowa in the coal camps there and the ones in Hiawatha? Was there any difference?
Oh, not a whole lot.
I think there was. In Iowa they were about all four room
houses. They wasn't built as good as Hiawatha houses. We never had water. When we come out here we had water and lights. We were still using kerosene light in Iowa when we come out here in 1947 .
EM: Did you still have outhouses then? OB: Yah. Both places.
5

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
CM: When you moved to Hiawatha you had indoor plumbing.
OB: We lived there awhile before we got a house with indoor
plumbing. The first house we had, didn't have. Where did you live in Hi awatha, which sections?
EM:
OB:
KB:
EM: Up by where John lived?
KB: Up from where John was around in that circle.
EM: Did you live in any other places in East Hiawatha? OB: No we just lived down by the bridge.
EM: By the baseball diamond in that area? (Flat town) CM: Where Morris and Darlene Olsen used to live.
EM: Well where had the Olsen's gone?
CM: They moved to Price .
EM: Okay.
CM: Then did you move further uptown?
OB: We moved across the road from where Delpontes lived.
After she left, then we moved down by the railroad t racks (string town) and from there we moved to Price.
EM: When did you move from Hiawatha?
OB: I don't know, what year was it?
KB: 1976! I am always going to remember t hat .
CM: Did you retire before you moved down t here?
KB: In 1972 he retired. We stayed there four years after
retiring .
It was called East High ... Up on the circle .
6

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
CM: How many years had you worked in the mine in Hiawatha
before you retired? KB: 25 years.
EM: He got there in '47 and retired in '72 so that is twenty- five years.
EM: So you moved to Price because they made you move out of there?
KB: 1972 when I retired. Max Robb, he was the supper then. I says, "Could I stay here?" He said, "Yes, until we need the houses." About four years then they started hiring a lot of young guys. Andy was still up there but his wife wanted to move down here so bad, but Andy was still fixing on the house. Anyway, Wilma, she tried to get it fixed. Me and John we ordered a trailer through Bunnell. Andy found out we had to move, of course he was working in the mine. So he come to us the next day and said, "Why don't you and your dad put a trailer apiece on this land." He bought this land off from Dick.
EM: Your neighbor over here?
KB: Yah.
CM: So where does Andy live? Does he live by you here?
OB: Right here in this house next-door? (The house is just
across the driveway)
CM: John's trailer is right in the back here? So you are all
right here together.
7

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
EM: That makes it nice. So you did something besides shovel
coal in the mine. I know you did that. What else did you
do, did you run a machine?
KB: Done everything but run that (continuous) miner.
EM: You were a motorman and joy operator?
KB: I got my foreman's papers, but I didn't.... Do you know
when the Lark fire was on? (Lark mine owned by U.S. Fuel caught on fire and they sent many of their Mine and Rescue Team from Hiawatha there.)
Well, I pinch-hit for Clarence Wall's section; I was shooting shots for him. So I had papers. Bernard Christianson was afternoon shift foremen. At that time John L. Lewis was trying to get foremens into the union.
EM: Oh, was trying to get them into the union?
KB: The big companies didn't like that.
EM: Yes, I bet.
KB: That's the way it turned out you see. Andy was to move
here from Wellington. I am glad that we did. Our children wanted us to buy a home. But a fairly good home was $3,400, a new one. I am glad that we went and bought this. I got it paid for!
CM: Well, that's good.
CM: Pearl (his niece) was saying that you used to walk around
up there and find the Indian dwellings. (He points to some Indian artifacts on the wall) .
8

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
EM: Oh, my yah, a lot of artifacts.
KB: I don't believe in digging up graves. I guess in that
EM: KB:
CM: KB:
twenty-five years that I was up there, that is what I found.
My goodness.
Twenty-five years I found that many arrowheads. There are two or three that might be from Iowa.
Did you ever find the granaries up there?
I got the part there you grind the grain in. It's under the house. I found a dwelling up there along the side of the mountain. As you go up South Fork the first ledge on the right. There's a guy I forget his name. We had it cooked up to have the University (U of U) to come up here and go over that. Well deer season come along, some boys went there, they set on a ledge. (by the cliff dwellings.) Those things was shaped semicircle. It couldn't have been a granary cause the pack rats had carried it all away. Granaries are tight. Anyway, these boys got in it. I says, "What did you do that for?"
What did they do?
They tore it down? They thought they were going to find gold in there.
They dug it out. But that was full of pack rat manure. Built out of that ledge about that high. (About four feet) Down on the corner of that bench there's paintings.
EM: KB:
OB:
9

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
EM: On that same ledge? Are the rocks still up or did they
tear them down to?
KB: They tore some of them down.
EM: But there are still some there?
KB: They ruined it.
CM: I can't find it because the rocks aren't there anymore. OB: It was kind of hard to see. Just had to know what you
were looking for.
KB: I think that Clarence is still going to get some
University guy there.
EM: Kids will do things without thinking sometimes. It's that
first ledge up South Fork on the right?
KB: Yah, if you ever go up there. Go kind of slow it shaped
EM: KB: EM:
something like pottery, kind of fancy kind.
Is it at the base of the cliff?
It is up on the side.
Oh, it's on the side of the cliff? As you go up the side of the mountain then you come to the cliff. So would it be right at the base of the cliff right at the bottom?
KB: No not too far.
EM: KB: EM:
But it is down on the mountain side a little bit more. Just up where they could reach.
Is this the area where you found the arrowheads or just all through there?
KB: I found the flints there, chippings. 10

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
EM: But these were found where? In different places?
(referring to his collection) KB : Y a h .
EM: All around.
CM: KB:
CM:
KB:
CM:
KB:
OB:
KB:
EM: KB: EM: KB:
By the underpass? On the hill?
There's graves there vet there's been some dug out. In that underpass going to east Hiawatha they went right through a grave there.
That's right! I heard that story that when they made that whole section there was graves in it.
A little ways down there are three or four graves that ain't been touched then there one or two that have been dug out.
But nobody ever bothered them except for when they dug
the underpass.
Yes, well somebody dug below there. I don't know when that happened; that was done before we come out.
He found some of this stuff over by that old ranch. You know, going toward Huntington around in there.
Over there instead of going to Moreland you go to Huntington, that there is where the Aikens lived.
There on the right?
There on the left.
Oh, on the bench.
You had to really search. There's people some from Calif.
11

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
and Australia all around there to try to get them beads.
EM: Oh my goodness.
KB: See down a hard rock mine they get copper some of it is
kind of hard. That's what they made a lot of their beads
out of. It turned green but it's ---?---
EM: What were some of the things that you did for reaction up
there?
KB: You mean Hiawatha? They had the bowling alley there. But
they didn't keep it up. They let it go. There were two or three times we had a lot of company come out. So we ask the coal company if we could clean it up and use it. They let us do it. It took us two weeks, John and I, to clean up those aisles and round there. As you go down the hall aisle to your right that is where they gambled sometimes.
D: You fixed the thing up there and had a roller skating rink.
KB: We had a youth program.
OB: Before that they had basketball that the kids come up and
played basketball.
CM: Did you play baseball with John?
KB: Not too much.
EM: Were you involved with the youth program up there?
KB: Oh yes, I was chairman of it.
EM: They cleaned the amusement hall floor and then you had
them roller skate in it or what? 12

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
See we tried to check dope, believe it or not. We got the parents, school board, PTA. They let it get by. Just like the guns is now. Anyway, we choose eight on a committee. Took Mormons, some Baptist, other religions, some non- religious. They was parents so nobody would holler. Then we got the little young program teenagers make their rules. But we couldn't make any rules against the law; the county would shut us down like that. (Snaps his fingers) Anyway, then we had the older youth program make their rules. It worked. All of them was all together. Anybody would do something wrong they would nail him
right now.
What year was this?
I can't say just what year, just in the '60s I'd say. We ran it quite awhile. We bought one of the first pop machines, cooler? Pepsi? We bought a used record player.
That cost five hundred dollars.
a Pepsi guy to come every Thursday morning. I worked the afternoon shift. So that I would be there when that pop machine needed to be filled. We had a roller skating. They weren't playing much basketball after that.
EM: Where did the money come from to finance it? 13
KB:
CM: KB:
CM:
Q: Yes.
KB: The kids drank more Pepsi than anything else . So we got
Was it a juke box? Where you had to put in a quarter?

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
KB: We got it off the pop. It was twenty cents a bottle. We
got ten cents that got ten cents. That's about the markup in the store about fifty-fifty.
EM: This was in the early sixties?
CM: Who supervised the youth?
KB: Every Friday and Saturday, Friday we had the roller
skating and we had one guy take care of that. Lyle Nelson, Tony Lupo, Max Littlejohn, them were Catholics, Max he wanted... He was on your committee too. I told him when we were going to meet. He wanted to get a little more room over there, but we had the ping pong over there for the youth program. For the boys and the girls, one side for the girls and one side for the boys. One time we had some boys who wanted to take over the whole hall. I said, "That side's for the girls as long as they want to use it. The boys always wanted to get more. But our rules worked up there. I told Littlejohn if you want to come and get extra room for the Catholics there, come over and have a meeting on it. He never come. He wanted me to do
it. I said, "I got nothing to do with it Max. It is up to you." One time Jackson come there... one time they were going to tear down the whole amusement hall.
EM: Oh my goodness!
CM: They condemned i t .
KB: A guy named Gildersleeve. He wanted to tear it down, but
14

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
after we started the youth program, we was having complaints about the kids coming to use the amusement hall. Mr s . made a complaint that the kids were stealing her apples . Bruno says they been getting in that building behind the barber shop. The next time I came down to get my pay, he says, "Hey, Barnett I told you if
things didn't go right we were going to tear it down." I says, "What's wrong?" and he told me . I says, "That's the cops job . " I was smart enough to know that .
EM: Who was the cop up there then?
OB: I don't remember. You had a committee and two of you out
of the committee took care of the hall that night. How
did you do that?
KB: Well, we done it alphabetic . If your name started with A
you were first. We took two each night.
CM: How much did you pay them?
k: All volunteer. All the work I done, I never got a cent ,
I done it for the sake of the kids.
CM: Were your kids all grown then?
OB: No, they were still teenagers.
EM: Did they still have a Boy Scout Unit up there at that
time?
KB: Yes, John Draper he was the head of the Boy Scouts. He
says when my turn comes I don't have to come. I says when your turn comes we're going to call for you. This is for
15

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT everybody in Hiawatha.
EM: So he didn't think that he needed to take his turn?
KB: He did though.
OB: They used to come and get me sometimes when Kendell was
working afternoons. To go up and supervise. I went up there one night and one of the boys was doing something he shouldn't have done and I bawled him out. He says,
"Your just getting as bad as Kendell."
EM: You had to keep a tight rein on some of the kids.
OB: He was ornery.
KB: That Lowe boy. Don Lowe's kid. They are what I call
habitual, never change. They would be that way all their life. So one day I was down there. Dennis wasn't trying to hide. He had BB gun. He was shooting out some of them lights for the basketball, big lights. I says, "Denny, you go get those lights or I am going to tell your old man." He went and got some lights. About a year later I ask, "Denny where did you get those lights?" He says, "I swiped them out of the bath house."
KB: He knew if he signed up over at the store, his dad would question him. Whenever something went wrong and he was in the middle of it, he would go home and tell his dad so and so done this and so and so done that, trying to cover up. I tried to help Denny. Sometimes he didn't have no change I would give him a pop. But you didn't want to
16

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
turn your back on them kind of people.
EM: KB:
EM:
KB:
OB: KB:
I wonder where he is now?
Last I heard he was in Rocksprings. I think that's where he was when his dad died.
Who were some of the bosses that you worked with up there and some of the men there in Hiawatha?
Clarence Wall, Verg Olsen, when I first got there for a little while.
You worked for Bernard Christensen didn't you?
That was after awhile. Cause you see he had to take over
afternoon shift when that fire was up there. All the bosses went up there because they didn't have no one to fight the fire. They weren't (Lark Miners) organized like they were here.
That was the time that Shefton and all those guys went up there.
What did you have to do to get papers in the coal mine? You have to study mine books. You had to have a safety light and know how to use it, and a blue print of the mine. You might be poor in the rest of the questions but you better not be poor in them two. If you didn't know the mine you was no good.
How did you get hold of a safety lamp to study it and use it?
Company give you safety, company give you the lights.
EM:
EM: KB:
EM:
KB:
17

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
They had them big old heavy ones, all brass. Then they come out with the aluminum.
EM: So when you got your papers you had one of those heavy brass lamps? (shook his head yes)
KB:
EM: KB:
CM: KB:
OB:
KB:
You had to learn how to use it really well. You needed to know how to read the blue prints of the mine? See I knowed that in Iowa.
So the rest of the stuff you just studied from a book? They had a book that you went over before the examination.
You didn't have to go to any classes?
Sometimes, but they would be on first aid. We had to brush up every year on first aid.
The most important job you had was pump man wasn't it? You had that job a long time. (Shook head yes)
I told Bernard when he come back from that Lark fire, you can have my papers . He says, "What' s the rnat ter Barnett?" I says, "I would have to quit the union to be supervisor. I ain't got a foot to stand on. They could fire me the next week." That is the reason they didn't want John L. Lewis to have those salary people. Since then it's showed. Every one of the guys that worked when I finished. Andy, all the guys on salary. What they call that steel works in Florida. They had hard rock mines up around Salt Lake in those mountains. Anyway, they took it
18

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
over the second time. They took the back... and beat those guys all out of their pensions.
EM: So you gave your papers up and went back into the union? KB: No! I stayed with the union. I was permitted to boss that mine. (mountain)? While I went back to work for the union I could see that our union still pays our pension and
health care.
EM: The bosses then the company had to pay their pensions
then, didn't they? Now a lot of these companies are
defunct and no more.
KB: They went bankrupt and kicked them out like it was
communism.
EM: When they go bankrupt there is just nothing left.
KB: The whole company for about 12 years back. The new
company went haywire. Busted.
EM: The mines back in Iowa, and the mine here in Hiawatha,
what would you say would be the main difference between
the two mines?
KB: The coal is different. There ain't no mountains back
there. Generally you go down a hill and look for where the coal would crop out. Generally they would go down in a slope, down in the hill and then go down with a shaft to the coal. Out here they go up, the coal seams, called South Fork Tunnel, you could see the coal.
EM: Did they have as much water in the mine back there?
19

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
KB: They had water any time you had a dip ... There is another
thing the union did ---?--- the company after I came out here. Wet pay a, a dollar a day. If you got all wet, that dollar was for you to keep to buy wet gear.
CM: Like a raincoat?
KB: That's what that dollar was for.
EM: So do you still belong to the union now?
KB: He points to a union emblem on the wall.
EM: 6363.
KB: I pay dues. There's a lot of guys don't. Here's a hat I
got lately. I got that (the hat) with the sixty year
button.
EM: Where you at the Labor Day Celebration in Helper? I wish
that I had known that.
KB: It would have been a good place to get history.
EM: Well, maybe next year.
CM: Let's ask Mrs. Barnett some questions. How she felt about
her kids growing up there?
OB: I didn't think to much about it, it seemed like a good
place for them. They didn't get into too much mischief. EM: What did you think of the school there?
OB: Well it was a good school.
KB: I'11 say this about Hiawatha. Everybody knowed everybody.
If you go to the reunions or what they know you. There was all mixed up people. Different religions, different
20

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
nationalities, but they still favored one another. That was a good little town.
CM: I remember when I was there, if anyone needed help, everyone was there to help. If you needed meals brought in or if you were sick, there was always help.
OB: That's right.
EM: In Iowa when you lived there. Was there as many different
nationalities in the coal camp as there was here?
KB: Mostly Italian. There were Slav's like over there were they are fighting. Czechoslovakian. Polish. Here there is mostly Greek, some Italian. But back there mostly
Italian. They all had to come through Ellis Island. CM: Ellis Island.
KB: You know what that was? They was still coming through there when I was growing up. Anyway, a lot of people says they should have this or that. I says your dad came from Europe over here just like their coming from Mexico now, to Ellis Island. Generally when they came through Ellis Island they had to sign up. Most of them come across a variety of lingo.
CM: That's what they called this part of the country, Carbon County, is called "Ellis Island". Because of the fact that they had so many different nationalities here, thirty-two different nationalities in Helper.
OB: I didn't know that. I know they called it a melting pot. 21

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
CM: How could they mine coal with all those different
languages? How could they communicate?
KB: Thru our union we help them. Regardless. When I started
EM: CM:
working, the union was only seventeen years old. I'd say about 1919 or something, it started the first part of nineteen hundred a little past. They hired a lot of darkies from the south, some of them had been in slavery. Consolidated Coal Company is still the biggest coal company. They thought they were going to get cheap labor. Anyway, right off the bat they joined the union. Number 10 that's how many mines they had up till then. They built up to 6,000 at the coal camp. They had their doctor they had their dentist and druggist and everything. Darkies and all cause that's the way we dealt, just cause they was a darky of Italian they got the same as I did, all equal.
The union made it that way.
You had the unions there in Iowa in the early nineteen hundreds, is that what you said? Cause I know the ones here didn't start tell nineteen twenty-three. Because they had a big right and everything. So they had quite a time getting the unions in here.
The union was here when World War II come out. They had what they called the running wage scale. Anytime a big company started up they had to pay that, it was equal to
KB:
22

the union pay scale. We had at that time... up to Friday, if he worked any over-time. What we want to do is hire more people, instead of giving that guy premium wages Saturday, Sunday double time. Hire somebody. But the company would get hold of two of them. That's the idea of that thirty or forty hour a week. Everybody looked forward to the end of the week so they could go on a
trip. F: Yes.
KB:
I am going to tell you something about the oil company. They want their Sundays on Wednesdays. I got a brother, who works for sand plant the company.... they work twelve hours a day. We always call him Babe, but he is taller than I am, his name is Howard. I says, "Babe, during the war in south Iowa.... Omaha went across the state line, because there is a federal law. Got to pay that.... wage scale eight hours. They made a ruling they would work twelve hours. That's during the war, then on Thursdays from then on everything was an hour-and-a half for the rest of that twelve hours. But they still upset the weekend. Who want's that? The majority of the people would vote against it ...
Everybody now is trying to get their forty hour week in as quickly as they can and have the rest of the time off. We have too much free time as it is now it seems like.

EM: What were some of your duties during the day while your
husband was in the mine?
OB: Just regular stuff, housekeeping and watching kids.
EM: Did you join any clubs or anything like that?
OB: No, no. I didn't.
EM: Just go visiting neighbors or something like that?
OB: There were always neighbors around, but I was not much of
a neighbor.
EM: Just stayed at the house there?
OB: Most of the time.
EM: Did your folks take advantage of the Price Trading
Company coupons?
OB: No. We said if we got the money we'll buy it. If we
don't, forget it. So that is the way we did it. So we
didn't get in debt.
EM: What was your first new car?
OB: First new car we had was a 1953 Plymouth.
EM: What year was that?
KB: They was starting to have overdrive in the cars then.
They didn't have any here. Didn't have any in Salt Lake
so they had two or three in Moab. I went there. EM: How did you go there?
KB: My son-in-law took me .
CM: Did you pay cash for it?
KB: No, I got it through the credit union.
24

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
CM: How much did it cost?
KB: $2700 dollars.
CM: For a new car. That's pretty good. Wish we could get one
like that now.
EM: What year was that?
KB: About 1953, something like that.
EM: So, what did you do during vacations?
KB: We generally went back to the Barnett reunion in Iowa, at
the 4th of July time.
EM: So how many of your family came out here? Just the two
brothers?
KB: Yes. I got a twin and he stayed, but they were going down
hill, just like it is out here now. But he got a job at the veterans hospital at Knoxville. They paid good and got good benefits.
CM: What did he do there?
KB: He was the supervisor on the cook. He showed you how to
cook.
EM: What was your favorite holiday in the coal camp?
OB: Oh, I guess Christmas. We'd get together with John's
family. Oh we got together for all the holidays.
KB: We would get together and then some of the brothers would come from Iowa. John's wife (she's in the nursing home).
CM: Yes, we interviewed her.
KB : She says anyone comes from Iowa , they have beds down

OB: She says that is the bunk house.
KB: Pearl, that's her daughter, she goes out and gets it
ready for them.
EM: Did you ever go hunting?
KB: I used bow, a few bows, for pheasant.
KB: They got ketches in a snowstorm once up there. Remember
that big snowstorm in the early '50s?
CM: That was one bad storm, I know.
EM: Some of them left their cars up there all winter. Floyd
had a set of chains, he went bareheaded up in that big blizzard storm. They was shooting in the air to get his attention. To get him to come back. He delivered the chains, but he had a hard time getting back because in a blizzard you can loose all sense of direction. He made it back. A lot of them came off the mountain after only two or three days of hunting.
OB: David Wilde's was with him and when he came in house he just beamed. He said, "Oh, am I glad to see you." He thought maybe he was up there in the snowstorm yet. I don't know who all was with them.
KB: David he come down through the underpass, there by the ball diamond. I says to Floyd my oldest boy. I says, "The Wild kids comin!"
OB: David was good to Floyd though he took him--his sister 26

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
lived in Provo I think it was. They would take him with them up there. Just real good to him.
KB: David he liked his beer. But of course in the mine you weren't allowed to drink in the mine, or smoke. But they had it against him, the churches, cause he drank beer. There couldn't have been a better mechanic than Dave. He
CM:
KB:
could put his finger on anything.
He was a good mechanic that's for sure, even when he was a teenager. Someone taught him that because he knew that before he was ever out of high school.
One time he was working for ... on his section. I come in to put the pipe in and I could hear old Dave cussing. I says, "Your praying again, Dave?" I was kidding him. Clarence would ride him too much. One time Clarence come to me. I says, "Let it go in this ear and out the other what he is doing." He kept him. There was two or three guys he let go. They was eating dinner at the kitchen, he
says, "I let that guy go I shouldn't." I said, "I tried to tell yah. He done the work that it would take two or three guys to do."
OB: Do you remember Ruth Davis? We went to California about two weeks ago now and on our way back we stopped to see her. She's failed a lot. She was happy to see us. But she just sung the praises for the union, she says, "Kendell, I don't know how I would have got along without their

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
help." She has had quite a bit of trouble had to have a doctor and one thing and another. She sure did sing their praises.
EM: We were talking to Remo Spigarelli, you know his dad got killed. They didn't have anything, the union or no government subsidies or anything like that at that time.
CM: His mom got $500.00 at the time of his death. The Odd Fellows Club took up a collection to bury him.
EM: You know Remo, because he is a member of the local 6363 too and he's ...
KB: He is a good union man.
EM: He sure is.
KB: That's what we need.
EM: Did you ever go fishing?
KB: No. When it went I always used to cut my pole when I got
there by the water. Had an old cork, a string and a hook. Floyd and A lbert they would borrow Johnny C arr's good fishing equipment. I got the most fish.
EM: Where was this?
KB: Huntington. I'd like to see that old bobber go down
(cork) and then I would pull it up with a fish on it. CM: Did you go fishing with him at all?
OB: No. I never cared much for it. I always had hay fever. I
never got out where the weeds was much. CM: So you didn' t go on picnics?
28

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
OB: Oh yah, sometimes but I always paid for it.
KB: Well they commercialized on fishing; sports you got to
buy everything there is. There's a certain place up
Huntington Canyon were you can't even fish with a worm. EM: It's got to be a fly.
KB: That the old timers way. (worm)

OB: EM: D: EM:

OB:
Christmas was your favorite holiday. Where did you go to get your tree? Did you go to Price and buy it?
Oh no, we took off up the canyon, and picked it out. Who would do that?
Kendell and the boys.
Was that a fun thing to do? Did you pick it out before the snow came or wait till after?
Sometimes yes and no.
Depended on how soon the snow came. Sometimes the snow came in September.
I know that I went up West Hiawatha once with Jimmy Garber, and Mack Nelson looking for a Christmas tree and my shoes were not the best, and boy it was cold. So that Christmas tree I appreciated a lot .
When they went up after a big snow then the top of the tree would be sticking up out of the snow and they wold look pretty good.
Did you make your own decorations?
EM:
OB: Oh, I guess we did I don't remember too much about it.

KB: We hit a deer just as you pass red narrows coming down
OB: k: OB:
KB: OB:
KB: EM: CM:
Spanish Fork Canyon, there are a bunch of trees against the railroad. We was coming up the canyon. A trailer was coming down and spooked the deer out in front of us. He come out to the road, and he hesitated, then he decided to jump. I slowed way down. I was going forty miles an hour then. When he jumped he went ahead of the engine hood. He hit the windshield, busted it worst in front of her. You should of hear her squeal.
Heck, I thought I was going to get him on my lap.
On my side the glass wasn't even hurt.
On my side it was just shattered, there was little shades all over me. It didn't hurt me, or cut me or anything. But I was dumb I started to brush it off. Then I thought oh, oh, them things could cut you.
It could cut you all right. It broke the ariel off.
We were dumb we didn't go back and see what happened to it or nothin' we just went on. We should have went back and seen if we killed it or what.
Traffic was coming.
That's a bad place to try to pull off.
What made you stay here, in stead of going back to Iowa after you retired?
The kids are settled all-around .
KB :
CM: So how many great grandchildren do you have?

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
OB:
CM: EM:
OB: EM: KB:
Ask Kendell. We must have about twenty-six great, we got eighteen grand.
That's wonderful.
Do you remember any of the accidents up there in Hiawatha.
He got his leg broke one time. What happened?
I was drilling and shooting with a little short guy from Arkansas. See you cut the bottom. It hung down like whiskers (the coal) I got out of there. I says, "It's not safe." When you cut underneath he ask the question about where he was going to drill the hole, it had to be high. My buddy was short and couldn't reach it. I said, "You run the drill today." That section fell down on me like it was a tree falling. I thought I was clear of it, I backed up against... the drill it was on an old Ford Chassy. It went down to about the middle of my leg. I could hear it snap. Then old... he was trying to stick a trip in there. The union sure gave him heck. I had to wait an hour there before the ambulance car come and picked me up.
So while you were waiting there with your broken leg they wanted to get another trip out. ("Trip" meaning a line of cars to go down to the tipple) . So did he get the trip in there and get it out?
EM:

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
KB:
EM:
KB:
CM: KB: CM: KB:
Yes, but he got a lot of chewing.
The ambulance car had to wait for the trip to get out before it could get to you.
Yes, I went into shock, sometimes shock can hurt a person more than the injury.
So who was your doctor?
Dr. Merrill.
Did he come into the mine to you.
No. He went in the mine when there was a bad cave. Merrill Gearensen was boss in that section. There were
two men killed in that fall. I was hanging pipe in that section, I could tell.. . so I started backing out ... weren't set no timbers.
They didn't set the timbers? That's what my dad used to get so mad about. He would say, "I am not going to send my relatives and friends in there when you don't keep it safe."
He was a good boss.
I'll say. I worked for a lot of bosses and your dad was one of the best. One thing about Shef if he didn't know he would let you go ahead and do it. Max Robb he knowed it all. That was the difference between him and your dad. You don't know who is going to hear this Kendell!
CM:
OB: KB:
OB:
EM: This is your opinion. What we'll do is type this up and
let you go over it.
32

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
EM: How many foreman did you work under? Shefton and Max... KB: Langford, he was one of the shift foreman when I come. EM: Were you in the mine when he was killed?
KB: Yah, well I was working. There it was again. They was
getting coal hungry. Then shot the shot. He didn't let the smoke get out of there. Ten or fifteen minutes he goes back in there and looks ....
It came down on him.

EM:
CM: My dad felt really bad about Langford. They were really

good friends. That was bad.
KB: Outside of that Langford was a good man. But if you get
that smoke you can't see the top, it might be dribbling
a little bit and warn you .
EM: When you keep doing the same thing time after time you
get a little careless sometimes.
EM: What did you think when the siren would go off down at
the tipple? OB: They went off?
EM: You never heard the siren very much?
OB: No, I think they kind of outlawed that on the account of
it upset the women.
KB: Back in Iowa they blowed the stream whistle.
CM: I can remember being in school and when that whistle went
33

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
off you could sure tell which kids dads were in the mine, boy they were really worried. When I was there it was always blowing. (1934 to 1954)
KB: I'll say this about the miner. Cause we had some that wasn't worth their salt. But the majority of them was good.
EM: Let me ask you a question about the mine, when you went in the coal mine did you have one of those round buckets or black ...
KB: Aluminum bucket, we called them a deck-a-top that is where we put our lunch on the bottom of it was water, a gallon of water, and a lot of times that gallon was not enough.
EM: Did you ever have to drink some of the water in the mine? KB: Not in Iowa. The water is good here, there was sulfur in
the water, turns red.
EM: Did you ever toast any of your sandwiches on any of those
stoves or anything in the mine?
KB: We didn't have them in Iowa. First I noticed is when I
come out here. They was all handmade with the elements
underneath.
EM: That was the fist time I had ever seen them was up there
in Hiawatha and that made the sandwich taste a little bit
better.
KB: Sometimes you could warm a meal over. One time Lyle Asay
34

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
and Carl Orton was coming late for dinner. But we was all in there yet. We had brandish around you know to keep the heat in there. Anyway, Lyle had about six or seven or eight sandwiches on a plate.
All of them his?
Carl had one about in the middle, they ask Lyle where was his, he said this much is mine. He had all but one
EM: KB:
EM: KB:
sandwich; Lyle was a heavy eater. I'11 say one thing about Lyle he was a good worker.
Hard worker.
He and Tony Lupo you had to watch, you had to be a student of human nature around people especially if you was a boss. Your dad used that a lot. Anyway if you add fuel to the fire old Tony he might pickup... or double trees, and hit you. He could grab you like that and shake you.
He was so big.
Stout Archie was the same way. You got to let it go in here and out there. (pointing to his ears) Not add fuel to the fire that is what caused a lot of those fights. You don't have to be in a beer parlor either.
Did you see any fights in the mine?
No I never did see any fights in the mine.
I think people worked pretty close together and they knew they had to depend upon one another in there to get in
EM: KB:
EM: KB: EM:
35

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT and out.
KB: The union was kind of strict; they had rules too.
OB: Who was it that throwed the light and hit the other guy
in the mouth?
KB: That was Tony Lupo.
OB: Who did he hit in the mouth?
KB: A guy from Huntington, I can't think of his name. Tony
was all the time goosing. They throwed something around his neck. He was just getting ready to put his battery on. He throwed it, at the man and I think he had seven stitches.... was letting it go see, he was getting a kick out of it and so was the guys that stood there.
EM: So somebody goosed Tony and Tony threw the light?
KB: Yah, they threw something around his neck and he thought it was a snake. You see he was touchy, Clee Gordon was
that way.
EM: All you did was point a finger at them and they would
jump.
KB: A lot of guys took advantage and it wore them out.
OB: What happened up there at that little house up there at
the top of the tram?
KB: It was an ideal day, we come out of King I Portal, to do
some work. That little house where you would stand to wait for the trips to come up and down, up by the hoist. I knowed Tony was sitting there with the door pen and I
36

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
put a rag over him, it sounded like four or five horses kicking in there. I should never have done it. It could hurt somebody bad. He just couldn't get out, it was just a little door.
Were you doing it to tease him.
Yah.
That fell on him or something and he just went crazy? After that I kept my hands to myself. It's due to human
EM: KB: EM: KB:
EM: KB:
EM:
KB: KB:
nature, I can't use a better word.
What about the bath house?
They would throw cold water on you, you would get your eyes full of soap and someone would throw cold water on you.
I heard that someone nailed down one of those aluminum buckets on the plan one time, the motorman would usually come by and just grab the bucket by the handle, on his way out. Someone had nailed it down so he just got the handle, course the rest of it stayed there.
Oh yah, they goof off once in awhile.
In Iowa, they and Pershing Fuel named after General Pershing first World War. It was made after the war, state law has it that only ten men in the cage. They had two cages, one comin up as the other one went down. They goosed this guy on the cage and there was so little room that he almost fell off. He could have broke his leg. So
37

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
the foreman said that the next man that gooses on the cage is automatically fired. They tease too long on some guys .
KB: Do you know... he was just naturally goosey all you had to do was point your finger at him.
EM: I worked for Cliff Simmons on the material gang up there in fifty.
KB: He was there when I come.
EM: KB: EM: KB:
Byrd Gordon was dispatching.
He was working long wall.
Sure different now today isn't it?
I was there when they would shoot it out. Well they still shoot it out on long wall, but they start it with a five hundred foot face. Now they have changed it from eight hundred to one thousand feet. They try to say that those hydraulic jacks timbers protect you but ...
Can't hear the cracking when they are going down.
In the Wilburg fire down there, they couldn't find two men. When they did find them ... return ... they were only taking a five hundred foot face ... they overload ... they couldn't get out. A lot of that equipment they get from Germany. Now the union they ... less men long wall. But
they never stopped progress.
So you don't have any breathing problems from working in the mine for forty years?
EM: KB:
CM:
38

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
KB: I get the black lung. All this side is slick. We all get
foreign impurities in the coal. That's the dirt. Most of it is sand. The Mountain is all sandstone. When you shoot the shots, the foreign impurities that are in the coal you breath that with the coal dust.
I went up to Salt Lake to be examined two months after I retired. I didn't need what they call a blow job. I had to take an x-ray and all this side was glazed. Sand sticks to the walls of your lungs. If you get a speck of sand in your eye you can go to the doctor and get it out.
CM: So one whole lung is gone.
KB: This side is glazed over. The other side is in better
shape.
CM: You didn't have any trouble getting your black lung?
KB: Nope. Two month after I retired I got it.
EM: Was the union responsible for getting that black lung
pension started?
KB: Oh yah, they fought tooth and toe nail. I give the union
credit for that as the big companies, they are just like to you the way they are to the salary guys. We don't need you anymore, go collect your pay, no pension.
EM: You named some of the guys up there that you worked with and everything. You said that Frank Lupo was outstanding, can you name some other people that you worked with?
KB: Sam Alfore, Armstrong boy, I got two big pictures down 39

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
the barn that shows who I worked with. A while back last year Remo said there is only sixteen of us left on the fellows that were my age. I knowed there were two or three that have died since then. When somebody dies, the union will get him a new bible and take it out to the widow, if she is alive.
OB: Did you know Carl Dixon? They came there about the same time that we did.
[END OF SIDE ONE]
EM: Did you ever have anything to do with Harold Gates there
at the Hotel? KB: No.
EM: What about when Tom Jackson left, who took over after him?
KB: Max Robb took over, and then Clarence Wall. The day that Max Robb left to go over to Gordon Creek he was still growing up the things that he ought to know about the mine, he thought he did.
EM: What did you think about Tom Jackson?
KB: I thought he was okay.
EM: He was a personable person.
KB: He was one that caused me to come here. He came back to
Iowa and Arkansas and Oklahoma.
EM: Who was running the store at the time you were there? KB: Price Trading.

Once in a great while. We went t o the movies it was free. Did you pile the kids in the car and go down?
We didn't have a car at the time. John usually took
carload of them down.
When you first came there was it real hard cause you didn't have much money?
It wasn't easy for several years. John and them were here. John had a good job, and they helped us out a lot. I had three hundred dollars to spend when I got here. You brought your own mining gear?
Yes. I picked the hard hat. They first come out with that aluminum hat. Babe, my brother he had an aluminum hat ... oh they could juice them, if they touched a hot i ron . The later ones were safer. A lot of people don't know that about the aluminum hat.
I never thought about that, that old wire up there has a lot of volts in it.
. .. Tucker got electrocuted there . In the mine?
No, on the outside.
EM:
KB: EM: OB:
41

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
KB: His hat touched on the transformer, and about seventeen
thousand volts went through him. He had nails in his shoes. Damp it makes it worse, and the cement was wet. Jackson was still super then...it come through a wire. He was supposed to go and notify by law the electric company, and they would have a man come out there. The State Miners Company man come. I was over to the oil
(gas) station there, that is where you would get the rumors. Upstairs in the mine office that there State Mine Inspector was sure chewing on Jackson.
OB: What was that other guy's name that got killed on the tipple?
KB: Riches.
CM: Bishop Riches?
CM: Did you go to church there in the community church? Did
you have minsters there?
KB: Yah, and minister could be there. The company furnished
that building. Any religion could work out their own time... When the new company come along they sold that church to the Christian Alliance for a dollar. The place that the Mormons had they sold that for a dollar. They had a good church and a good piano. They bought it for a dollar and then they started hauling that church to Price Jackson, and Lee Kirk jumped all over me. I says they bought it. The Mormons brought theirs. So I goes down to
42

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
the auditors and there it was black and white.
CM: Did the company just not want to take care of the churches anymore?
KB: They were ready to throw in the sponge.
CM: Do you know why they tore down that church?
KB: They managed to take a lot of stuff to Price. Some guys
in the valley bought the building. Just tore it down for
the lumber.
EM: So the Catholics were kind of out. They gave something to
the Mormons ...
KB: They still had that room in the amusement hall.
EM: The Greeks didn't have anything.
OB: They had ministers come in there but they never stayed
very long. They were usually young men or just married. CM: I remember one that came there. He and his wife stayed in the top of the Official Cottage where Bill Star lived. They had an apartment up on the top floor. That's the only ones I remember. They must have come from Price to
preach there. OB: Johnson's.
EM: Were any of your boys in the Boy Scouts?
OB: Yes, both of them were. Well they didn't get into it a
whole lot. But still they went. I would have them down to
my house, who was with them? Mr. Marshall.
CM: Herb Marshall was a scoutmaster for long time, I think.
43

 KENDELL AND ONA BARNETT
KB: Lyle Nelson was the scoutmaster too. That was later. EM: Who was the Sheriff when you first got there?
KB: No, I can't.
CM: Was it Mr. Gentry?
EM: Oz Morgan was before him, I guess.
