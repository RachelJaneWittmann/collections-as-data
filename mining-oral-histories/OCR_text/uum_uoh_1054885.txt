 THE FOLLOWING I S AN INTERVIEW WITH M. H. KERR, DIRECTOR, T AX COMMISSION, CONDUCTED BY MITCH HADDAD A T THE ST A T E CAPITOL BUILDING, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH ON AUGUST 4, 1970.
MH: Okay, Mr. Kerr, the first thing I'd like to know is a little bit about yourself please.
MK: Well, I was born in Salt Lake City, and when I was four years old, my parents and family moved to Payson which is sixty miles south, and that's where I went to high school. Then I attended the Brigham Young University at Provo. I didn't go to work for the state government to begin with; I worked in private industry. I started out working as office manager for a garage and then I came to Salt Lake, and this was in 1941, and went to work for Bens and Arms Company in their production facility here during the Second World War. And I went to work there as a clerk in a purchasing department, was later promoted to purchase order auditor, and then a buyer. From there I went to work for a short time with the Army Services Depot at Ogden as civilian in charge of procurement for the engineers supplies section. I came back to Salt Lake, and I won't hit all of the places I worked. I went to
work for the--this was still in wartime--I went to work for the state of Utah as cashier for the State Land Board. I worked there for a year and a half, and then accepted a job for the M. H. King Company in Burley, Idaho as office manager for that company.

It's a chain of variety stores. Two years later I returned to Salt Lake and engaged in public accounting work. In 1950 I came to work for the State Tax Commission as a purchase order auditor--not a purchase order auditor, but an auditor in the income tax; later in the corporation franchise tax. Then I was asked to come into the property tax during the
rush period. I did that for three years, and the third year I stayed on and became director. That was in about 1954. So I've been director of Property Tax Division since that time.
MH: So you were director or associated with the tax commission during the entire uranium boom?
MK: Yes.
MH: Now, there's been quite a bit of, well, discussion
especially when talking of the legal aspects in regards to the assessment work. Utah has a mandatory assessment as well as different other property tax aspect. What are some of the aspects of property tax which are covered by your commission in regards to
the mines?
MK: All of the mines and public utilities, railroads, and
oil producing properties are assessed by this office- -I mean by the tax commission, and the detail work and recommendations are made from this office. Now

when you get into mining it's pretty much cut and dried as far as metalliferous mining is concerned because we have a net-proceeds law involving a three- year average, and it's merely arithmetical
computation after you get the proper information from
the assessees.
MH: During the beginning of the uranium boom was there
ever a conflict over whether or not uranium was or
was not metalliferous?
MK: Yes. That was right at the beginning, and it was
determined that it was metalliferous and therefore subject to the net proceeds. I think we got an opinion on it and then made a decision, the tax commission made a decision which to my knowledge has never been challenged. But a more important--and I've been thinking about this, outlining--we've had some real serious problems in the state of Utah, maybe you're aware of, involving tax loss up to two million dollars in tax money. There was a question one time whether we could assess uranium properties, not because of tnem being metalliferous, but rather because most of the uranium production came from unpatented mining claims. I have here an attorney- general opinion rendered in 1955, Number 55-002, which stated the question in here: can the state of
3

 M. H .
KERR # 1
Utah tax unpatented metalliferous mining claims under existing law? And the conclusion was yes. And, of course, if you'd like a copy of this, you can have
it. Now that was the first thing. We've never been in the habit--or rather been in the practice to tax unpatented mining claims. The taxation in Utah, when I refer to it, the basic taxation is every mine, and mining claims should be assessed at five dollars an acre, and in addition thereto, they shall be assessed under the net proceeds formula, that is, if there's production. So the large amount of evaluation on any of our mining property comes from the net proceeds, not the five dollars an acre. So we're very interested that we can assess unpatented mining claims, and we didn't even put five dollars an acre assessment on them, but rather if they were in production then we invoked the net proceeds and therefore we got our value.
MH: Uh huh. Now this is commonly referred to as the hundred-dollars-a-year assessment work. Now is that according to that arithmetical formula that you're saying?
MK: No, no. No, in order to hold an unpatented mining claim--and here, I'm not an authority on staking out and ---?--- All of this is handled either through
4

 M. H .
KERR # 1
the Bureau of Land Management or the counties. Under their rules I understand they have to do a certain amount--they have to stake it out in a certain
fashion, and they have to do so much assessment work. And in order to hold their possessory rights in the unpatented mining claim, they do not have fee title, but they do gain the right to mine the ore.
MH: Now there you mentioned unpatented and patented mining claims. Now, considering if I'm right in this figure--70 percent of the actual land in Utah is government owned or public domain, if I remember.
MK: Well, you probably are correct.
MH: Uh huh. So that would be a definite deficit as far as
taxation, wouldn't it? I mean if this question of whether or not you can tax an unpatented mining claim were to come to bear against the tax commission, then you'd lose quite a bit of revenue. I mean isn't this where you get into this--?
MK: Well, most of the hard-rock mines like Kennecott Copper and your lead-silver mines are patented. Now in the case of the uranium, because of the nature of the animal, they would go in and find a body of uranium ore and they would have it mined out before they could ever go to patent. It was a timing element there. So there was no necessity for them to patent
5

 M. H . KERR # 1
the ground. After they got the uranium out, they weren't interested in patenting it. And they would move off and leave it.
MH: Uh huh. So it was kind of like a hit-and-run type of thing before both the taxes and the responsibility of the claim was sent up to you?
MK: Well, no. We had control of that. In the case of uranium we had a very tight control on all of the activity through the AEC. We get reports from the AEC and did it during this period. We secured reports
from their Denver and or Grand Junction office telling us exactly the production of ore because it was controlled at that time. You couldn't sell uranium ore except to the AEC. And so we knew exactly who was mining, where they were mining, how much they were mining, and how much they were receiving for it. So we had really a tight control on that. There's no question of anybody getting away with anything because they were in conflict with the federal if they tried. And there's no use of mining uranium ore without have a place to sell it, and the AEC was the only place you could sell it. Now they've loosened that up. Now private places can buy it. Since that time, since the Atlas mill and other mills--I think Union Carbide had a m ill, and these vcarious m ills
6

 M. H. KERR #1
have cooperated with the tax commission in giving us mill reports on all their purchases. So we know pretty well what's going on as far as production's concerned: who is producing, where it's being produced, and how much their proceeds are.
MH: The question comes to my mind--you mentioned before that through your average of taxation and this is something I guess your tax commission went through a long struggle in order to have that aspect of it changed. Now could you explain to me exactly--
MK: Well, the net-proceeds law was in existence before the uranium boom ever hit, and it was specifically tailored to long-term operations such as Tinic Standard Mining Company up at Eureka, in the Eureka district, particularly in connection with Kennecott Copper's operation. Now one time they had a one-year and then they changed it to a three-year average, so it's to smooth out the income, and it has worked very well. It has worked very well and in the hard-rock mining industry, in the copper, the lead, zinc, silver, gold, and this type of mining activity. When
we started into uranium, we saw some defects in it. Now this is something you may want to discuss, how we corrected those defects over the years. Now in the first place we had this matter--the one you
7

 M. H. KERR #1
mentioned, was it metalliferous? We made a definition there. After that was determined, we had to find out
if we could go on and put the net proceeds formula on the production from unpatented mining claims. This Attorney General's opinion gave us that right, so we went ahead. Then it became apparent that one reason it didn't work well with the uranium operation is that it's a three-year average, and if a company-- say, a uranium company goes in and they have three good years and then suddenly they comes to the end of their uranium and they close down, they still have to pay ad valorem tax, or did have to pay an ad valorem tax until the three-year average worked itself out. So they could be paying up to three years after they had stopped production. And there was a lot of complaints about this. So in about 19--, we'll have to correct these dates later, but in perhaps the 1963 session of the legislature they--or perhaps the 1965- -yeah, '63 or '65, they put the wording in the law something like this: " ... provided, however, there shall be no valuation based upon net hang of proceeds of all uranium or vanadium mines for the purpose of assessment of any such mine or mining claim for any one year in which there were no gross proceeds realized in the year next proceeding the year of
8

 M. H .
KERR # 1
assessment." Now that cleaned up that inequity. And these things seem to dovetail in with another. Beginning in about 1958 and becoming real critical in 1969, we had mining companies such as the Atlas Minerals Industrial Uranium, Hecla Mining Company, Homestake Mining Company which had very successful
operations during the late fifties and early sixties. And when they come to the end and they had exhausted all that they could commercially, or peaceably take out, they just closed down the mines and refused to pay taxes. And I have a schedule here for the years
1 58 to '68 which shows there was a total of $1,950,000 in tax money which was lost due to this method of operating. Now we immediately went to court back in about 1963, '64 where we had a case of the Atlas Corporation in which we forced them to pay this--I'm getting ahead of my story a little bit. Back in the late fifties we could see that some of these mining companies particularly fly-by-night operators were mining, selling, getting out, leaving us holding the bag for taxes. So we went to the legislature and the legislature gave us a law making it possible for the tax commission to require security in sufficient amount to insure the payment of the ad valorem taxes and the type of security that
9

 M. H .
KERR # 1
the tax commission felt was necessary. Now unfortunately the tax commission did not completely
implement this law. They were persuaded by representatives of Atlas, Homestake, Hecla, and other large ones--they were large companies, had plenty of assets to take care of any taxes legally due. [They persuaded us that] it would be a hardship to force them to put up, say, a million dollars in security. Well, I guess the advice of the department, the commission just didn¥t require it of some of these companies. Well, they got caught. I can't say that it was crooked, but the companies took the position that the law provided that the property itself was security itself for the taxes on it. And that's all the security they had, and that's all we could take. And they it would be their duty to their stockholders to take advantage of all the provisions of the law. That was their position and the court upheld it, and it went to the Supreme Court and they upheld it.
This is a Supreme Court decisions that upheld this?
MH:
MK: I'll have to check that, but I believe so. I believe
it went right to the Supreme Court. I know I sat through the district court in Price. Yes. And then, of course, at that time the tax commission immediately required every uranium and vanadium
10

 KERR # 1
producer to put up security, and we've had done since that time. Now in addition to this security provision, we were successful in 1967 to have an in personam obligation extended to all mining, all metal1iferous mining. And so as not to make it not
discriminatory, we pulled the words uranium and vanadium out of the law and so that now if any type of mining company has no net proceeds in the year preceding the year of assessments, they will not be assessed. And then the in personam obligation extends to all metalliferous mining companies. So now with these changes in the law and with vigorous administration, or tightening up of our administrative procedures, we feel we have the thing under control now. Now is this the type of thing you're interested in?
just wrote this out. You may be interested in turning of the machine and reading that. See if that stuff is of use. [Interruption]
MH: You mentioned that the administration had tightened its policy. Now that infers that when the uranium boom started many people were caught unaware. You know, they were caught unprepared, and would this
M. H .
Uh huh.
MH:
MK: Now when we edit this I can go through--last night I
11

 M. H . KERR # 1
hold true for the tax commission as well?
MK: No, I think not. I think that at that time they had a very knowledgeable individual who had been working with the tax commission and administering under the direction of the Directorate Division--the mining
assessments. His name was Horace Higgs, and he was familiar with almost every pot hole in the state. He'd go out in the summertime and take field trips, and he covered the waterfront pretty well, I think, as far as getting the essentials on the books, we were in very good shape. And they either stopped paying their taxes--of course, in Utah, on a mine, if you have ground you don't have to pay the taxes for four years until we got this security provision in our law which they have to put out a time C.D. or cash or some kind of government security, and it's in our hands. And when the taxes come due that all, if they don't pay them, we go ahead and cash his time C.D. and pay the taxes. And if there's anything left over, or any interest, we give it back to them, and
then we require them to give us more security. We keep the security two years in advance. They have to post security this year for 1970, or the first of last year, say, January first or as close thereafter as we can implement it. We will have required every
12

 M. H .
KERR # 1
person that's operating, or company that's operating a uranium mine in the state of Utah to have posted with us cash, bond, a time C. D. , or a government
security that's readily convertible to cash, not only for the 1970 tax year, but for the '71 tax year. And as soon as we use up the '71, '70 tax year, we make them post one for '72. So we keep two years in advance on our security.
Now according to law if they do stop operation of the
MH:
mine, they do get their security back?
MK: Not until after all the taxes that are legally due
are paid.
MH: I mean like they won't be assessed, you know, even
though they have had security for two years on.
MK: Well now, say that a mine that has posted with us a time C.D. to take care of the taxes for 1970 and '71 should cease operations today. They would have taxes due for '70, but it would not be based on '70 operations; it would be based on '69 operations, '68 operations, and '67 operations. Now in '71 they would have a tax due because they did have net proceeds or gross proceeds in '70, so they would owe us tax in
'71. But if they didn't operate in '71, they would not have to pay anything in '72, and we would return any excess security we had at that time.
13

 M. H . KERR # 1
MH: Uh huh. So it's kind of like they fill the gap as
they go. You go as far as they can for taxing, and
you return their money?
MK: Yeah. The law provides that any interest accruing on
the time C.D.--the time C.D. is the most popular because they can get 6, 7 percent on that. That money belongs to them. All they have to do is pay their taxes. Normally the bigger companies will pay their taxes now, and ask us to endorse and return their time C.D. so they can cash it in and get the whole thing back and repost for the future years if they're going to operate.
MH: I notice that on your desk you have the record for San Juan County, you know, the tax losses there.
MK: Yeah.
MH: This brings to mind a question. You've mentioned
large companies so far, but what about the smaller companies? What is the process when they evade their taxes? I mean it would seem most likely they would be the ones to do it.
MK: We require security from them, as we do the larger ones. We require security from all of them so we have no problem now. There are a number there that have smaller amounts, and this isn't all the tax loss. We had quite a large tax loss in the Emery County, which
14

 M. H .
KERR # 1
I could get the figures on. This only covers San Juan County. In regards to amounts, there may be a number of smaller ones with amounts that weren't so startling. But now this in personam--you understand what in personam obligation means.
MH: While they're actually on there, on there present, or--
MK: It means that, well, let's see.
MH: I think there's a statute in the law that states it
identically.
MK: Yeah, it'll be--now here's something on this security
tax, and I'm reading from 59-5-65 and that's amended, "Provided that the tax commission, in order to insure the payment and collection of all of the ad valorem property tax imposed upon uranium and vanadium properties, may require the owner or the person engaged in mining the same to deposit with it such security as the tax commission shall determine. That security may be sold by the tax commission at public sale if it becomes necessary to do so in order to recover any tax, interest, or penalty due." And then it goes on to say, "The notice of such sales shall be served..." and so on. And this is the one we added in 1967 which really tightened it up. The mining interest felt that we didn't need both of them, but
15

 M. H .
KERR # 1
we felt that we had to have two routes to go. And this would this would follow your small ones possibly. "The ad valorem tax imposed herein upon metalliferous mining claims and property shall be an
in personam obligation of the owner or the operator of such claims of properties. And such obligations shall not be satisfied until paid in full. If a mining claim or property is sold at preliminary or final tax sale, pursuant with the provisions of Title Fifty-Nine, Chapter Ten, such sales shall not extinguish the in personam obligation of the owner or operator of such claim or property. The in personam obligation shall continue against the owner or operator of such claim or property until paid or otherwise satisfied. Other or personal property of the owner or operator may be seized or sold to satisfy the in personam obligation. This remedy shall not be deemed exclusive, but shall be in addition to any and all other remedies provided by law for the collection of these taxes, provided however, that nothing contained herein shall abrogate existing powers of the state tax commissioner and the boards of county commissioners to compromise or adjust assessments or taxes." So we went through a lot of
problems and court action and worked with 16

 M. H .
KERR # 1
legislation, and the legislature worked very well with us. And now it seems like we have gotten the thing tightened up and taken care of. And I wanted to mention one more thing. Due to al1 this, the tax commission has allowed me to put on two more people. One is an auditor who right now is engaged in making net proceeds audits. If we find in the audit that they have claimed expenses that they're not entitled to, if they fail to report some of their proceeds and this type of thing, then we're going to put a
supplement, or additional assessment on them. We have been understaffed in the past and we still are to a certain extent, but we're in a lot better shape than we were. We use every means we can to be sure that we get the right reports. For example, I mentioned before this matter of getting reports from A.E.C. Now take oil and gas, which is a little bit off the subject, but for oil and gas production, we require the taxpayers to make reports on our forms of their production for ad valorem purposes as well as for occupation tax purposes, both in metalliferous and oil and gas. In the case of oil and gas we get a monthly report from the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission showing us how many barrels each well in the state of Utah produces and the amount that it's
17

 M. H . KERR # 1
sold for. So I think we run a pretty tight ship by getting this type of informations and utilizing it.
MH: You almost have to, though, for your resources, right? I mean if you didn't, you'd [have your] two million dollar tax loss over and over again due to the nature of your resource industry? Is this true to say?
MK: Well, I would have to say that I feel that we have gotten the assessment on rolls. Where the trouble comes in is the legal attack to the assessment itself.
MH: What type of legal attacks? For example, when you're trying to pass your measures through the legislature, what types of methods were used to block them there?
MK: Well, we had some, oh, let's say, static from some of the mining interests when we tried to get this in personam through. We had a real---?--- on the floor of the house here back in 1967. We finally prevailed. Some of these companies said that it wasn't necessary and that now we were enforcing security of provisions of the law that we didn't need to with the in personam. We were able to convince the legislature that maybe we didn't need it, but it wasn't going to
hurt anything for us to have it. In other words, we had lost money; now let's do everything we possibly
18

 M. H .
KERR # 1
can to avoid to having anything like that happening in the future. And so they went along with us. But I will say that the mining interests as a whole have always supported us in anything that we have asked
for in the way of the law. Now I remember that such reliable companies as Kennecott Copper, they were right with us on this in personam basis. "We don't care what kind of laws you pass. We intend to pay our taxes. Put all the safeguards you can because we'd like to see everybody else pay their taxes." That was the position they took--and other reliable companies. So I can't say that we--
MK: I haven't had a chance really to read this over, but when you get through putting it together, I can pull out the--
MH: Okay, thank you. So there wasn't any real, for example, lobbying or soliciting or that type of thing going to block you?
MK: Well, one of the members of Atlas--I guess maybe they were just sore. There had been a lot of this big court fight to defend their actions. I know one of the officers of the company or one of the legal representatives of the company appeared before the House as the committee of a whole and gave their position and opposition to this in personam, for
19

 M. H . KERR # 1
example. I was given an opportunity to testify before that lobby, and one day they broke the dam, the next day it was called back and went through unanimously-- this in personam section.
MH: So in essence then, it seems that you've been going through procedural tightening up basically. And in order to go through that, you not only had to go through the courts and the legislature, but you also had to sometimes buck heads directly with mining companies?
MK: Yes.
MH: And change some of the laws? So that now basically it
seems like a state function of what you had to do and which what was done, right? And each move you made had to be though approved by the legislature?
MK: Well, yes. It was just a matter of cleaning up the basic law here and there, and getting the type of law we needed on the security function and on this in personam. The other things were largely administrative, and we thought that we had--for example, if a company like Atlas had several mines we could go in and seize all of them in order to satisfy
the obligation if necessary, and that's one of the points that they beat us in court. I still don't believe--I think a company that's in the uranium
20

 M. H . KERR # 1
field, if they're in a mining activity in a county, that every bit of the activity should be considered one mine.
MH: The courts ruled that each mine was as a separate piece. This is like, for example, when one company has three hundred claims, yet all they do (?), what prize mines or, you know, "glory holes" as they call them. And this is a large question that came up.
MK: Uh huh.
MH: Now, just kind of as a final question: would it be
safe to say then that by its very nature would you call a uranium [mine] a different type of animal? I mean uranium seems to have a unique nature by itself, I mean in pertaining to mining laws as well as in pertaining to, you know, taxation, ástate laws, and different other things. Then is it true to say that when the boom of the magnitude which hit Utah in the fifties and early sixties came, then did it take a while for the state and the organizations of the state to adjust to the size of the boom and the amount of money which was going in and out and other different things?
MK: I would say so in the area of collection. But I would not--I do not think there was any problem in the
21

 M. H . KERR # 1
function of the assessment.
MH: Right. So it was kind of like the theory was there, but the practice was sort of---?---.
MK: I think that we adapted to our problems rather quickly and got those assessments on the rolls, but that's only half of the job. It's the job of tax commission to get the assessment on the rolls. And then we'd, the way this works, we have record of assessments and then after we make our assessments of all the property that we assess, be it utility, mine, the oil well, whatever it is, Utah being a---?--- state in ad valorem taxation, we had to allocate these various assessments out to the areas and identify them to the areas in which they were actually located. Then we sent our assessment figures
out to the county auditors just like the county assessors passes his local assessments on to the county auditor. The county auditor would compute the taxes and turn it over to the treasurer to collect. Now our problems didn't come in putting the assessment on or giving it out to the county auditor or computing the taxes. The problem come in collecting the taxes. Now the tax commission in Utah has certain powers and duties, and one of these duties, either specifically or implied--in the first
22

 M. H .
KERR # 1
place, tax law does not contemplate any loss from taxes, so when we saw that there was a necessity for some different administrative procedures in the county treasurer's offices and some help in state
law--see, the tax commission got in the collection business with this bonding deal. We've never had to collect taxes. Now we collect the uranium taxes for the counties, and when the county bills a company and they fail to pay it, they notify us and we pay it out
of the security that we have. So we got into a county function there out of necessity which we had never had to do before. But we had broad powers to instruct and direct and require certain things from county officials. Well, we could say that under the existing law that there was a void in this one area. So we had to plug it up, and we had to go to the legislature to do it. And naturally it was better for the tax commission to do it for the entire state than for a county to come up and try to do it themselves to the legislature.
MH: Uh huh. So in a way it was negligence of the county in collection that really caused you as many problems as anything else?
MK: Well, yes. I think that I wouldn't call it negligence so much because they would bill these companies, and
23

 M. H. KERR #1
they would inform us that they had not paid, and that was how these big suits came up. When they informed us that Atlas Minerals failed to pay a certain amount of taxes, we got busy right now and got in court. But we got beat. So then we had to have law, and then we got our law.
Uh huh. I see. Thank you. Is there anything else you'd like to add in regards to this subject?
Well, I think that after you have this prepared that
MH:
MK:
MH: MK: MH:
I'd be very happy to, of course, edit and go through and make suggestions at that time, and I'm sure things will occur to me that I should have said and perhaps in the meantime I can make some notes and additions if this would be what you want.
Okay, very good.
But you are interested only in the uranium?
Right. Uranium mining industry per se of the Colorado Plateau. Okay, thank you.
