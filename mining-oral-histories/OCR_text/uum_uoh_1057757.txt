SG:
RS:
Mr. Sundwall, can you tell me a little bit about your background? When you came to Moab?
Well, I came to Moab in the fall of 1949. I came here as principal of the high school--actually, the principal of whatever school it was; it was a combined school at the time, kindergarten through twelfth grade. And I served as principal for I think it was eight years. Then I went into People Personnel Services, whose setup was the director of people personnel for the district. Up until six years ago---?---.
Had you been in this area before you came to Moab or in Utah?
I'm from Sanpete County, from---?---, Utah. I had been in the Moab area quite a little bit. My first teaching experience was in San Juan County. That was before World
War Two--just before, and then I moved to Price where I was in Carbon College for about eight years. Then I came from there and finished out a degree from the University of Oregon, finished out a degree there.
SG:
RS:
SG: So you were quite familiar with the area before you took the job as principal?
RS: Yeah.
SG: About how many students were in this school at that time? RS: At that time we had--I would have to include the other
two schools in the district at that time. They were two

 ROBERT SUNDWALL #1
small one-teacher schools: one at Thompson and one at Cisco. But the first year I was here we had an average daily membership of 425.
SG: That's for the three schools?
RS: That's for the district.
SG: About how many teachers were there?
RS: I think there were eighteen in the district. Two of them
were out on these small schools and the rest of them here i n Moab.
SG: What were your impressions of the city itself at this time?
RS: Well, of course, I was acquainted with it, so I knew fairly well where it was. I mean, when you come into it, you recognize it as a rural farming area. I should say farming. I should say agricultural and stock raising and this. At that time the principle industries were still stock raising and small amounts of farming, some still exists, and some fruit growing. There was mining here at that time and ---?--- in the ADC was fairly active. We
were shipping ore out, but not in large amounts. This was still pre-boom, and therefore hadn't got anything yet. The people, of course, were the people that were native to our community in the sense that they had been here all the time, old family names that were part of Moab's history. Occasional names were coming in which were
2

 ROBERT SUNDWALL #1
primarily schoolteachers. And these were generally the new people that came in, not entirely but generally. So I recall it was a population of about twelve hundred when I come in.
SG: What kind of students were they at that time?
RS: They were very typically rural students. They were, oh, having ---?--- to ---?--- them, extremely unsophisticated. But even at that time, you wouldn't call it a backward type community. Everyone was quite education conscious. They were interested in education,
and their kids went to school. No dropouts, everybody went through school in those days. Not all of them very successfully, but they all went through.
SG: Then the community itself supported education?
RS: Yes. I remember we had periods of certain types of pressure turmoil. I think one thing you can say about Moab is that it's always been pro-school. We never had any of that type of problem except you have your periodic disruptions where you have a group that don't like what
you're doing.
SG: What would you--what were the main problems caused by the
boom in the school itself?
RS: Of course, there were two problems. The one worst felt
was really a surprise, however, in the fact that we did not have building facilities or plant facilities. This is
3

 ROBERT SUNDWALL #1
your major problem to start with. I suppose the boom struck actually in about 1953, '54. The population came
in very strong then. You see, at the one plant which is now a junior high, at that time, everything was housed in that one building with the exception of the shop class which we had installed. Outside of that, everything was in one building. That building, I think, was planned for not more than 400 students, maybe 425 with a bit---?--- But we started getting up around--oh, let's see, within a couple of years time, why, then we were running--oh, I would say, running up close to 1,000 students. And up until about 1955, we were trying to keep these students in that one plant. We had, however--some of the things we did to give you an idea of how it was, we had classrooms, I remember for two or three years, of---?--- forty students with one teacher. And we rented some rooms in the LDS church, the old chapel. And we had about three classes there. They were high school classes. When we owned the school ---?---, it's an old church building which sits just right west of the main building. This was a building that hadn't been used for anything except the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers---?---. And we moved into that. You have to go in to see it, I guess, because---?-
with a stage, and there were two dressing rooms, one on each turn at the back of the stage. And we partitioned
4

 ROBERT SUNDWALL #1
an office at the front of the stage and---?--- so that we used---?--- three classrooms. We had one large room upstairs. That's up on the second floor of the high
school building, and we partitioned that and cut a space for the door because you had to go through one class to another in order to get in. This is the type of situation we had for nearly two years.
SG: About how many students were attending these temporary quarters? Any idea of that?
RS: No, I'd have to look to make sure. But I think we were running up at that time a student population of--oh, I'd say at least eight hundred, maybe more than that. And the original building was built for closer to four hundred, maybe four twenty-five.
SG: How long was it then before the first permanent building was added?
RS: Well, the first new building was added in 1955 and '56. And that was the Hilleman Night School, which is now fifteen years old. ---?---constructed---?--- elementary students down there, and then this became a high school.
SG: And you started moving on for new buildings fairly soon once the boom started?
RS: That's correct. With all our planning, we were about a year, I think, working on the buildings. It takes about that long before you get a bond election and everything,
5

 ROBERT SUNDWALL #1
which we had to do in order to get it. Oh, that election
SG:
RS: SG:
RS: SG: RS:
for that building went over strong. We had no problems. It's just all the preliminaries you have to go through. So you considered the boom to be real almost as soon as the thing started? It wasn't going to die as fast as it started. It wasn't going to die off as fast--
It wasn't what?
It wasn't going to die off as fast as some of these other booms had in the past?
Are you talking about the beginning of it?
Yeah. Yeah, in other words--
Yeah, it was real. It began and hit the schools right at the start as far as it being effective from a population standpoint. Well, of course, right after Charley Steen made his discovery, that was the beginning of the opening of the boom, actually. And from practically that day on, why, people started swarming out. And, of course, his operation itself employed quite a few. The whole industry grew up even though there was a fair amount of industry, you know, before that. It was all, more or less, most of it was small mines and was not attracting national
attention. And, of course, as soon as the ---?---. For example, we started out with 425 and we have since that time had enrollments as high as--oh, we have maybe around 2,400. Something like that. We're now down to, I would
6

 ROBERT SUNDWALL #1
guess--last year we closed out with about 2,100.
SG: What reasons do you think for the slight decline then?
RS: For the decline?
SG: Yeah.
RS: We had a little bit of decline when we had little periods
of slump in our---?--- time. We've had a couple of---?- situations. And the decline most recently has been the slowdown of Texas-Gulf Sulphur. This is what occurred that slowed us down last year. It affected all last year
---?--- four or five years, and still---?--- next year. SG: Do you view this as being more temporary though, or--?
RS: Well, I don't view it as temporary. I think that we will
increase, but I think it will not be a fixed ratio or fixed level, but it'll be a much slower and more natural type of increase as opposed to an up and down ---?--- mining---?---
SG: To go back to the boom period, did the type of people that were coming in during the uranium boom, did they make different types of demands on the school district as opposed to what the original inhabitants wanted from their school?
RS: Yes. And interestingly enough, the demands primarily were for better facilities. They wanted, these people that came in started at a time when we were getting quite a bit of money. It was not just people that were all
7

 ROBERT SUNDWALL #1
working and all ambitious, a lot of them were used to a higher standard of living. They wanted, primarily,
better--they wanted a lot of---?--- and things to drive to, and things of this kind. Now this here was to start with--when you had a lot of, what you say, unsettled situations, and so on to---?---. And you see that a lot of these people were coming in from Texas and from California, mining-type people that were more or less used to some of these things that you don't necessarily have in an agricultural-type community. This here is what we were finding at first. A lot of things were not real, and as I said, a lot of them were just things they'd like to have, which were here, and so on. No, we never had-- even then we didn't have consistent criticism of our curriculum. I think this simply states that we had a fairly good curriculum to start with, and I think that Grand County has always been very ---?--- We're recognized that way now.
SG: How would you characterize your relations with these other residents of the community? Were you able to develop communications with them very easily, or--?
RS: I think in the main we were, yes. We ---?--- certain ones, of course, where you couldn't. We had them come from entire1y different communities. And you get in a person who came from there and into a more heterogeneous
8

 ROBERT SUNDWALL #1
environment and start getting sophistication into that. You also have your many types of religion connected with that. So you have this all reflected on the school---?--
-. But we never did have anything with the---?--- or the cause of destruction, or it caused a deadly change, you know, that we were trying to do.
SG: Did your job itself change, given--
RS: Well, my job changed, but I liked the change. Now as far
as the principalship is concerned, it didn't change to this. We began getting in--we didn't have quite the close family relationship as before these people came in. Therefore, you had to alter it differently in your handling it. That's not a very good way--but anyway, in your relationship to the student, the truancy factor became more prominent. And more ---?--- to it. And getting this solved then became a problem. Where before we could send out a truant officer who knew---?--- take the job in bringing in---?--- and would not have a conflict with the parent. Then we got to the point where people came in where this was not part of their lives, and then we had to make some changes. We had to do some accepting of certain types of behavior that we hadn't been faced with before. And my position changed in respect to my administrative ---?--- in behalf ---?---. And I changed that in order to fit better to what these
9

 ROBERT SUNDWALL #1
people were used to having. So it did create---?---. So
from an administrative standpoint we looked at it differently. We couldn't look at it--oh, ---?--- the child by his first name. I knew his family quite well, and so I ---?------?---certain types, certain methods. Then you get to the point where you're not as close and that's when you have to handle it differently. You use a letter instead of a direct-on-the-street contact. Or you don't go down and visit the homes of these people partly because of the numbers and partly because you don't know them that well. There's this type of change. Then, of course, we found that we did have to work to increase our curriculum ---?--- the high school. We did have to broaden our curriculum to meet those individual demands which we didn't have before. We used to cut off, for example, chemistry one year because---?------?--- soon came ---?--- change, so you have your physics and your chemistry. And you have a fairly stronger ---?--- for mathematics and for science. Where we used to offer algebra and possible have a half dozen students in a geometry class, we finally got it to where we're offering Algebra II and trigonometry and some of these higher level math classes. We had to move out in the different areas of the science field and so on. But we hadn't
offered it before because the need wasn't there. 10

 ROBERT SUNDWALL #1
SG: Does offering more technical courses, does this put a
further demand on the budget? Does this mean more has to be spent than before, beyond compensating just for the greater number of students?
RS: This is true. Yes. We haven't touched the finances much, but since you bring up that question--now the first year, we did not have a big financial problem. We---?--- the state of Utah for---?---, we only get part of the money from the uniform school fund. About a third of our budget has to come from local taxation. Now this ---?--- and what you get from a uniform state school fund will not educate a child. So when we started getting these large number in to start with, it didn't much affect us the first year, of course. We just---?---. And then we got a new plant with all the additional expenses there and continued hiring new teachers because, of course, we had to meet a certain class load style. And then we started feeling the pinch because we started getting students that we had to take care of and we weren't getting enough
money to take care of them with. I can't remember offhand. I'm not sure I ever did---?--- I guess---?--- where the tax money was, where--
