 THE FOLLOWING I S AN INTERVIEW WITH HAROLD BARTON, CONDUCTED FOR THE COLORADO PLATEAU URANIUM PROJECT , BY JOHN DONNEL Y AND STEVE GUTTMAN A T MOAB, UT AH, ON JUL Y 3 0 , 1970.
SG: Okay, could you give us a little bit of background on yourself, sir?
HB: Well, I was born in Tooele in 1910, and grew up around Monticello, ---?.---, and Blanding. I went to high school and graduated from Blanding. I went to B. Y. U. to college, and from there I went to Mount Pleasant where I taught three years in high school there. And then I went to Bingham Canyon, was office manager and employment agent for the mines until about 1949. Then in 1949, I came down to this country and supervised the building of this garage, the Red Motor Company in Monticello, and I spent three years there. Then I came to Moab, oh, in the spring of '51. I worked for the Ford Motor Company and sol automobiles and trucks. And during that time, I spenT five years with Ford, Christenson Motor, sold Fork trucks. During the time when the uranium boom started, we sold many, many ore-hauling trucks of the smaller size, up to F-8 tandem rear ends and dump
bodies and so on. I think in 1955 I went to the school district teaching mathematics in the junior high school, and that's where I've been since that
time.

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
JD: Before we go on a little bit later into some of the
analysis of the school now, you said in 1949 or
before you were working in some mines?
HB: No, in 1949 I went to Monticello and built the--
JD: What did you do before 1949?
HB: Well, I worked in Bingham Canyon, Utah. That's
Bingham Canyon, the largest open copper pit, and I
was office manager up there.
JD: Do you remember an employee list of people working up
there, how many people were on the payroll?
HB: The National---?--- Mines Company where I worked had about three hundred underground. It was all
underground. It was not Kennecott, the open pit-- JD: Right.
HB: It was finally taken over by Anaconda who drove that tunnel from Tooele to Bingham. I did the cost accounting on that project.
JD: And the other thing I was wondering about--you you got into the truck-selling business about when?
HB: Well, in 1949 for Chevrolet. Sold three years in
Monticello and then I came to Moab about
1 51I in
April of '51.
JD: You had so many people corning in from all over
different areas. What type of trouble did you have with like payments, working out credit and long-term
2
saw

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
payments? Did you have any trouble with that?
HB: We had very good luck with that. We had very good luck. We checked credit very closely before we put out, say, a ten to fourteen thousand dollar ore- hauling truck. We didn't have too much trouble with credit, not any more than usual. In fact, in five years we only had one repossession of cars and trucks.
JD: That wasn't bad at all.
HB: We had a very good record there.
JD: If you can remember back then, what were some of the
prices of the ore-hauling equipment that you were
selling on the different trucks?
HB: Well, the F-8 Ford truck with the tandem rear end and
dumpbody would sell for--a rig-up would sell for
about fourteen thousand.
JD: Fourteen thousand?
HB: And from there on down it was smaller trucks. And in
those days they didn't have toads to take these big semis that haul from the mines now. It was more, oh, dirt road, rough road, and it wouldn't take the big trucks. And that's where we sold a lot of equipment.
JD: What sort of options did they have on the trucks? What things could the buy or what kind of improvements on the trucks themselves were available?
3

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
HB: Well, the dumpbodies and hoist, and tandem rear end,
put in another axel, tandem axel, was the main thing. JD: Do you do most of your servicing yourself?
HB: Well, the dumpbodies and extra axel would be fixed
JD: HB:
on, say, in Salt Lake usually. In so far as their service and all that, yes, on the trucks after they were sold we did at the garage.
Did you have trouble during the boom obtaining parts? Not too much. Some parts. Once in a while we wold have to wait. Once in a while we would have to wait. But compared to the total market, we wouldn't have to wait any more than ordinary because this was just a small part of the country, you see. We could usually get pretty well whatever we wanted.
JD: How would your business compare before the boom and during the boom in sales?
HB: Oh, they were much more during the boom.
JD: What percentage, do you have any idea?
HB: Oh, it went from hardly anything, just a few cars and
pickups a month to several big outfits sometimes a month. Oh yes, we had a population here less than, say, a thousand people. And at one time, I suppose, in Moab probably we had ten thousand prospectors in and out of Moab. Telephone service was the one that--
was times when you couldn't get a telephone call out 4

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
for three days. And so they got more lines run in, you see. It took them all by surprise there.
Did that run into a lot of trouble when you were checking credit?
Well, that was usually--we could do that locally. Were most of the buys from local people?
Yes. They were local people. There were a lot of people that moved in and became local.
SG:
HB: JD: HB:
SG:
HB:
Do you notice a lot of people buying cars for families, or what was the usual buying trend during
the boom?
Well, of course, we sold more automobiles than before, but there was a lots of sales of pickups, prospecting pickups, and cross-country pickups, and
four-wheel drives started coming in pretty well along about that time.
Well, to kind of go back now. what were you reasons for leaving the mine operation and moving over into the selling of automobiles and trucks?
Leaving the---?--- Mines?
Y es.
I spent fifteen years there and we worked the mine out, it closed down. I was looking for a job. I
worked as a foreman building a subdivision up there for a while until--and that's how I got down here.
SG:
HB: SG: HB:
5

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
Came down and put up that--bought the materials and so on to put up the garage in Monticello and so I stayed.
SG: And what reason then did you have for moving into the school district in '55?
HB: Well, I had started out teaching school and had always wanted to get back into it. It started out as kind of a joke. Mrs. Knight, the superintendent of schools, she came into the garage one day. With the
influx of people, they were having problems and discipline problems and so on, and I made the remark that I bet the school kids wouldn't run me out of the schoolroom, which they had done to a teacher or two. And she says, "Well, you got a job." And I says, "All right, I believe I'll take it," kidding, and a year later I took it.
JD: What was it like when you went into the classroom?
HB: I didn't have any trouble at all. I get along good
with the kids. JD: Did you?
HB: Rather strict, I suppose, they say I am. I gave them homework though lots of teachers don't. I started off at the beginning of the year and set up the course for them telling them what to expect, and I had good luck with it.
6

 HAROLD BARTON #1
JD: Did you have any trouble back in the boom with kid
dropping out when a lot of t ime they could make a lot
of money just staking claims?
HB: Uh, some. But not a great lot of that. Not a lot of
dropping out. We didn't have any more than perhaps we
do right now.
JD: How about when you talk about your courses--did you
have any courses that could kind of prepare them,
gear them for a mining career in high school?
HB: Well, I taught mathematics in junior high. We have a pretty fair--we're quite proud of our mathematic
department here in Moab.
JD: What kind of a session were you on?
HB: We were on a double session. Seven in the morning
'till six at night, goi~g all day; that is, we split--
SG: I mean, did the teachers take different shifts or what?
HB: Yes, I was on afternoon shift. But I think we went about eleven o'clock until six; maybe it was twelve till six.
SG: For how long did this last?
HB: Oh, I suppose you already have that on other
interviews, but we were on double session a couple or three years, I suppose.

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
JD:
HB:
How about your facilities? What type of facilities did you have? Did you have all the equipment that you needed to teach with or--?
No, not as--no. See, it took the district by surprise really, this many students. And it was a little rough. Short of classroom space, I suppose, would be the main thing. In the math department we got along fairly well with materials. We just provided program where we didn't need any textbooks.
JD:
HB:
SG:
HB:
suppose, will always say that there is a shortage of something.
How about your bonding? Did you have any trouble getting money for the schools?
No, it seemed the bond elections they carried right along every time.
Has that been the case in Moab for most of the time that you've been here?
Yes, they've supported it pretty well. The town has supported it. There has been some dissent back and forth, but in the end it all worked out for what has been planned for. I think Mr. Sundwall would know
more about that than I do. You've probably had his report on it. But in the end we got along pretty good.
---?--- Something of a shortage, but then school people, I
8

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
SG: Did the teachers have any trouble at all with the
administration during the boom?
HB: Oh no. No, I don't think so. Not any more than usual.
They worked together. In fact, the teachers and the school administration of Moab have always worked real well together. We do now. We're the first district in Utah this year to sign contracts. Our negotiations and so on for salary raises. We've been that way all along. We haven't had trouble with the administration. We work together pretty good.
SG: When you talk of different standards for contract negotiations in comparison, say, to California or some other states so that we could use it for comparison, can you give us some idea of the range of teachers' salaries, depending upon their qualifications?
HB: Yes, bachelor's degree will start at, with this contract, at $6,000 and goes to $9,300, I think it is. A master's on top of that, oh, roughly about three or four hundred over that.
JD: A master's?
HB: Yes.
SG: So would you say then your top end is about ten
thousand dollars?
HB: Yes, around ten thousand. I think it's slightly less
9

 HAROLD BARTON #1
than that, without looking it up. But it's close to that, though.
Think they--
Well, yes, it's a little less than that, I think.
Do you think that the school and the teachers have pretty much got along on matters during the years?
Oh, yes, I think we've had exceptionally good luck in getting along together.
Do you remember any kids specifically asking you for help--the miners' kids wanting to know something about different figures or different equations that they were using in mining?
HB: Well, not too much in the junior high school. Mr. Littern in the high school may have run into that
more than I would in the junior high.
SG: What were the major problems you had with discipline?
Did you ever have any minority troubles or anything
at all during the years?
HB: No. We have had a few Indians. We have had a few
Spanish-Americans. We've had one or two Negroes. But there has been nothing as far as races go at all in the school.
JD: Have you had any trouble with vandalism? HB: In school?
JD: Y es.
JD: HB: JD:
HB:
SG:
10

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
HB: There has been some, but not nearly as much, I th"nk,
as other parts of the state and surrounding areas. We get a few windows broken now and then. We get a little bit of vandalism, a little bit every year, I suppose. But not bad in comparison to some of the schools I read about in the paper like in Salt Lake when literally thousands of dollars worth of damage has been done to a school building. Flood it with water and tear it up. We had a few window breakings
and things of that sort.
JD: So pretty much of the time, then, you're a pretty
much model school?
HB: Well, it hasn't been bad.
SG: What reasons do you give for this close
adminstration-teacher relationship or yours?
HB: They have some what you call might call old-time
teachers in here, say, ten, fifteen, twenty years, and they're pretty good teachers. They see the school's problems, the school district's problems. And they know how much money they can spend. They know what it's spent for, and they talk it over and
decide how much of a raise the district can stand, and we've never been turned down on what we asked for. We've never had to take a cut below what we asked for. In fact, one year they gave us more than
11

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
we asked for. They had some money that evidently we didn't know about, and they figured that they could pay us even more than we asked. And we got along that way pretty well.
Has anything like the teacher unions that have been
SG:
HB:
SG:
HB: SG:
HB:
corning into the urban districts--has anything like this started up in Moab?
No. No. I don't think any place in Utah has teacher unions. There was some talk of it a few years ago around the Salt Lake area that a few unions might come in, but nothing ever came of it.
Do you see this in the future, say, in the next five years or so?
I don't see it in the next five years, no.
Given that you had taught about ten years before you went back to it, what difference, if any, did you see over the years you were away?
The schools are better now. Schools are better. I think students are better. I think perhaps teachers are better. There's all kinds of teachers and all kinds of students, that's true. But I think schools are, what we say, a little more up to date. They are
better schools, I think, than they used to be thirty,
forty years ago.
SG: Would this be in all the fields or mainly in math?
12

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
HB:
SG:
HB:
SG:
HB:
In math and in reading I think they've been improv d. I think perhaps science is better than it used to be. You think it's because people are spending more money on education now?
I think so. I think they're spending more money for it.
In teaching mining and working in an area which is heavily mining, do you think that that type of background makes the district a little different in the type of kids that will be going to school?
I don't know. I was acquainted with the schools in Bingham Canyon which was strictly a mining town, and acquainted with schools in farming and cattle raising, and schools in Moab which is farming, cattle raising, and mining. They're pretty much the same, pretty much the same. Students are pretty much the same. I think we're maybe different than the large city schools. Probably much different. I think they
are faced with problems up there in the big cities that we don't have. Maybe we're lucky we don't have them.
SG: What kind of problems now are you mainly referring to that you don't have here?
HB: Vandalism for one. And students who--I sometimes think they're taking work away from students, so they
13

 HAROLD BARTON #1
having nothing to do. They have to do something, and so they do what they can do, what they get into and the mischief that they manufacture. In the smaller places, I think there are more of them working, and they have an interest in work that keeps them maybe out of some of the trouble they have in the larger districts.
SG: You hear quite a bit about the permissiveness of schools. Given that you went to school in this area, do you think there is any difference in this area between what is was then and what it is now?
HB: Oh yes, we're more permissive in some respects. I don't know whether you'd call it more permissive. It's a little bit--for instance, in dress, the miniskirt and so on, long hair, you wouldn't have been tolerated, you see, thirty or forty years ago, and we take it from them now. If you can call that permissiveness, I don't know. Some of the conduct of students--times change, and I'm not willing to say it's wrong or going downhill in our schools, but
times change. I suppose we teachers change with them. SG: In terms of what's demanded of the student, this has
gone up?
HB: What's demanded of the student?
SG: Yeah, in terms of in the classroom, or has it stayed
14

 HAROLD BARTON # 1 the same?
HB: Well, I suppose you would say that the better students, the student who will study, who have learned how to study, or who you can teach how to study, they work just as hard now as they ever did. But perhaps we have a few more, a larger percentage that don't study as hard as they used to. Probably a
JD:
HB: JD:
HB:
JD:
larger percentage. There used to be, oh, roughly 10 percent of the students didn't do too well; now I think it's up maybe to 30 percent.
How do you account for the fact that 12.1 1s supposedly your educational level? You think that's pretty much the fact?
That 12.1 is what?
In other words, people usually finish high school and then some and this is the educational level of this
part of the area.
Well, the average is 12.1, is that what it is? Now how do I account for what?
How do you account for this high level above the national average?
HB: Well, Utah schools probably have been a little high in comparison to the national average. I think quite along, haven't they? Think that you would probably
have the statistics on that. 15

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
JD: Right.
HB: It's probably typical of the Western area. You might
that same thing, say, in Arizona. I don't know what it is, but--have you looked that up? But these mountain states, surrounding states, usually have
been higher than the national average all the time. JD: Do they have regulations regarding the working of kids, say, from fifteen to eighteen years of age or
younger in Utah?
HB: Oh, yes. They have to be about the same as the rest
of the nation on that. We have to get work permits for them through the proper channels. They can take any sort of job which is all right. I think they prohibit kids from working more now than they used to.
SG: Have you noticed any increase in dropout rates from the time you were going to school as opposed to what it is now, or has this also remained pretty much constant?
HB: The percentage of the dropout rate is--I don't know the figures on it.
SG: I was just wondering what your impression of this was?
HB: I don't know think that we've got a larger dropout rate than we used to have.
16

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
SG: As someone coming to the area here, we heard on the
news on your radio station and your newspaper, we heard quite a bit about drugs being a problem in this area. We were wondering if this is a problem or just
---?---? a..
HB: This is just a little bit new. Just this past year, I think, we've got some drug problems. In the junior high, we have talked up there and have wondered if we had anybody using them. We understand that there have been one or two suspected of using drugs. In the high school, I think, we get a little more of it. Now how much of a problem that is, I don't know. I suppose you will get that from your interview with the superintendent of schools or perhaps the chief of police. We hear rumors and all and read the papers and know of some arrests that have been made, and in the last four months here there have been eight or ten that have been brought in on drug abuse.
JD: How do you gear your books for this in your health classes, or do you have health classes?
HB: We have a program started. We had the school, a drug school here, oh, around the first of the year with teachers and lecturers and so on from the Institute on Drugs. (?) And this is being handled mainly
through the health department in P.E. classes and 17

 HAROLD BARTON #1
teachers. They are also on the school people, on the committees for the control of drug use.
SG: Then as far as you know, it hasn't hit the junior highs yet? It's strictly a high-school phenomenon?
HB: As far as I know personally, it hasn't. I talked to the principal of the school and he suspected one or two may have used drugs. But I see no evidence of it in the junior high school during school. Now what they do after school and on weekends, maybe things go on that we don't know about. But I think we've been pretty lucky in the junior high. High school, I guess, is a little different.
SG: How much authority in the ---?--- schools does the principal have over what happens in the schools? Is it your indication that he does have a pretty wide spectrum to operate, or is there--?
HB: No, he's not curtailed too much. He has pretty much all the authority he needs, I think, to handle a case. And the authority he doesn't have, he can get if it's necessary from the proper place.
SG: How much freedom does a teacher have in classrooms in this area?
HB: It's never been a problem. I've
restricted. Whether the teachers don't need to be restricted, or whether we haven't had a problem of
18
never been

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
restricting a t eacher on what they do or what th y teach, or how they--not as much I read about in some of the paper in some of the l arger schools .
Is there very many problems over t enure i n this area? There never has. It's been an understood thing more
SG: HB:
SG:
HB:
in here. We do have it now, but it's still an understood thing, I suppose, after three years. You get a contract that is just renewed every year. We don't sign a contract, we just sign a renewal of the old.
The fact that there is so few minority students in this area, in the school district itself, could this be one reason why there is less of these different problems do you think? It's a more homogeneous area. Well, I don't know. I'm not acquainted with the other in order to compare it. All I know is what I read in the papers on what goes on in other schools because of the minority groups and so on. But it hasn't
bothered us here. Is that what you wanted to get?
SG: Yeah, that's what I wanted to know. Do you have any idea what part of the district is really considered underprivileged? I mean---?---? You know, some of your miners might ---?--- rate the poverty
classification?
HB: Well, in Moab no one goes hungry and there isn't
19

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
anyone who has to stay home from school on account of clothes. We do have a welfare department---?--- is all taken care of, and we do have some that fit into this place. But they're not looked down on in school. I can't see that they are looked down on by students or by teachers or by anyone because of, say, being on relief or welfare.
SG: HB:
SG:
HB:
SG: HB:
Are there quite a few cliques in school?
About the same as the average school, I suppose. It doesn't seem to be much of a problem.
Did you notice when you came into this school district if there was as many problems between those kids who were recent arrivals and those who had been here for quite a few years?
Well, anyone who is moving into a new district, getting acquainted and so on, there's a period of adjustment there as there would be in any school. But I don't see anything too rough about it.
It wasn't anything excessive then?
No. Was a time when we got some students, they say, that came from California, called the Pachakos, (?)
but they didn't seem to get a foothold here. Black-
jacket kids and so on.
JD: They kind of stayed mostly down by the river, didn't
they?
20

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
HB: Yeah, as far as school went , there was some l'ttl
SG:
HB:
problems with them, but nothing excessive, nothing that just couldn't be handled as it came up.
Were you able to tell which kids were from mining towns and which were not? I mean, were there any characteristics that were outstanding?
No. No. We had people from all walks of life. We had many lawyers' students, doctors' students, dentists'
students, engineers, accountants moving in here during that time too along with people who were not so well educated, or had little education.
Do you think this influx of people then brought up the standards of the district, or in other words, did they make any demands on the system?
Well, we had really two different types of people. We had the people from the upper income, upper educational occupations that helped out a great amount and those from the lower that tore it down some.
Were the new demands made on the district as to the type of courses that were offered by the school?
Oh yes. They offer many more courses now than they did before the boom started. In the way of fore i gn languages we offer French, German, and Spanish in our schools now. We didn't offer anything before. We have
SG:
HB:
SG:
HB:
21

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
had Latin. We're not teaching that one right now.
SG: So then, the school curriculum has widened?
HB: Widened, yes; widened a lot; widened in mathematics; it's widened in science; it's widened in the reading
programs. It's a much better school than it was
before the boom.
JD: How about your population in your different schools
now? Compared to what they were in the boom, what are
they right now?
HB: The number of students?
JD: Right.
HB: Well, we got about as many students as we had during
the boom. We're probably about two, three hundred--
about two or three hundred less, I suppose.
JD: How many people do you have at your junior high?
HB: We run between 450 and 500.
JD: And how many grades does that encompass?
HB: Three grades: seventh, eight, and ninth.
JD: Do you happen to have any idea of what they are at
the high school?
HB: They graduated something 1ike over 100 this year,
110. They have about three grades up there. They'll have about 350, I suppose. I'm not sure of that figure. You may already have that figure on your tapes.
22

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
JD: Do all the people t hat go t o the junior high all go
to the same high school? In other words do they continuously feed right through ten grades, or is there any other high school they can go to in any other area?
HB: There is only one high school here, yes. The population is influx. There will be many people going and coming all the time. They hold out well in other schools coming from this one. I can tell you that. I
just got a letter from a boy in Australia. He moved in May. And down there it's their winter month, so he's in school this summer. He just wrote me a letter
about their math department down there. He says, "You're certainly not behind up where you are, and probably ahead." He's talking about his algebra class. We get rid of the tough algebra class in the eighth, here in the eighth grade before we start on the engineering or any pursuits where it take a heavy
math background. It's not a watered-down course; it's a tough one. And he was in this school and left before we finished, and he is in school in Australia. I just got a letter from him yesterday.
SG: Are the schools here using the so-called new math technique?
HB: Yes, we have. And we combine a lot of the so-called 23

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
new concepts with traditional too. I think we're leading toward combining more than those strictly new math, so-called. I think we have run into difficulty
in strictly new math when they get into chemistry and physics and have troubles solving the problems. So we feel there are some drawbacks to strictly new math so we'll combine that with the traditional.
Is there any problems in this school district with any handicapped students?
Oh yes. We have a school right across the street here called the New Horizon School for mentally retarded or slow students. And we have programs in all the schools to help these underprivileged or handicapped students. We have in the junior high school on teacher that does nothing but teach reading to
handicapped and slow learners and slow readers.
average size of your classes?
HB: The junior high would be--oh, the average size would
be about twenty-eight, but have averaged as high as thirty-four. The last two years they've been averaging around twenty-eight.
SG: Is this thirty-four figure back when you first came
SG:
HB:
Do you have any idea how large a program this is?
SG:
HB: Well, it's in every school. It's in all four schools. SG: Yes, that's what I was wondering. What is the
24

 HAROLD BARTON #1
in and you were still trying to--?
HB: Yes, yes. We like to ---?---. I've had as many as forty-six in the classroom and t hat's a roomful.
SG: But these kinds of problems the district has met
with?
HB: Oh, they're taken care of, yes, by building more
classroom space.
SG: Where are most of your new teachers coming from? Are
other teacher like yourself coming from the local area, or are you getting more and more people from outside the state, say?
HB: We had quite a few teachers from Colorado. We have one or two from New Mexico in junior high school. I think we have three. But mainly from Utah ---?--- schools; Utah and Colorado mainly.
SG: Have you noticed any increase in the people from outside the area coming into this area to teach? Has this been increasing or has this always been kind of a steady figure?
HB: The number of teachers coming in?
SG: Yeah. In other words, what the district able to
recruit Utah people?
HB: Not all of them, no. They've gone out. They've gone
to Arizona, they've gone to New Mexico, they've gone to Colorado recruiting teachers in the years past.

Well, when would you say that the district was able to catch up with the population explosion that occurred because of uranium?
Well, as far as school goes or with everything?
Well, as far as the school district, yeah. Well, first of all, as far as your own observation of the junior high?
Oh, I think they were pretty well caught up by '62 or
1 63.
To kind of move out of the school now, did you ever get involved in any of the uranium mining itself?
Oh yes, when the boom started, I was selling Ford cars and trucks. We staked hundred of--oh, I suppose I won't say hundreds, I think we staked about three hundred claims, the group opposite the garage.
What kind of equipment were you using? Geiger counters of just eying it?
Geiger counters, and samples, and eying it too.
Did you ever decide to process any of this, or did
you just sell the claims?
Well, we sold claims and put them out on lease. We didn't make a lot of money, but we got our expenses back and a little bit of ---?--- money, and an interest in---?--- royalty.
JD: Where did you do most of your staking?

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
HB: W ell, every direction from Moab.
SG: Up towards the north, where were you staking?
HB: JD:
HB: JD:
HB:
JD:
HB: JD: B:
JD:
HB: JD: HB:
Cisco area. Around the Cisco area.
Were you mostly taking a four wheel back in and just
staking the land then?
Yeah.
---?--- the land different from others, or just any type of land, no matter what it was.
Oh, I think we must have put our claims in some of those.
What was the land selling for back then? Did it vary in price according to--
Oh, it varied in price.
Could you give us some idea about it?
Oh, say, for fifty claims we may go for all the way from five hundred to ten (?) thousand dollars depending on the deal, depending in the contract, depending on the royalty, depending on many things. No two are alike really.
How about with your corner staking? Did you have any trouble with that at all?
With what?
The corners?
The corners? Oh, not too much. We had some of them surveyed by engineers; not all of them, but some.

JD: Did you have any problem with claim jumping?
HB: No, we didn't. We honored other people's stakes.
There was a little bit of that going on, I
understand, yes, but that didn't happen to us.
JD: How about Moab? Can you talk about Moab strictly as a resident? What did you think? Did you see a lot of people that were doing something for the town, or
were they kind of lessening the spirit of the town, or what do you think of the people?
HB: Oh, the boom year they say was larger than the boom of California in '49. We had all kinds of people, all kinds. Many of them helped build this town up, and many of them didn't you know. But there are people here now that came during the boom and have been boosters of the town ever since.
JD: Did most of them stay when the boom was finished, or did a lot of them move out?
HB: Oh, a lot of them moved out. Most of them moved out. The lawyers moved out, the accountants moved out.
JD: Did you notice whether the prices went up when a larger flux of people came in?
HB: Not because of the boom, no. The prices didn't go up too much. Land prices of the houses and building lots
went up, yes. Went up out of sight.
SG: Do you think that you still have a pretty effective

city government even with the increase in size?
HB:
JD:

SG:
HB: SG:
HB: SG: HB: SG: HB: SG:
HB:
Oh, I believe so. There's always room for сmprov ment on that. And I suppose every town in the country would say the same thing.
Do you think that the miners pretty much blended into the population?
Yes.
Did you get involved at all in any of these penny stocks that were floating around?
Oh yes! Yes, I bought and sold quite a few of them. Were you one of the people that ever came out ahead on this thing?
I didn't lose.
Did you---?---?
I made a few dollars.
Do you still have some of these things?
Yes, I've still got some of them.
Do most of the people in the area become involved in
these penny stocks to a certain degree?
Oh, not most of them, no. Not most of them. Quite a lotofthemdo. Alotofthemdo. Yes, I gota lotof penny stocks, and it's been transferred from company to company to company until some of it's been pretty good. In fact, I sold too quick on some that was transferred from one company to another, and got
29

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
about sixty cents a share out of it, and a friend of mine that left here a few minutes ago, sold his not long ago for seventeen dollars a share.
So some people have really made quite a bit of money off these things?
Oh, yes.
What do you think was the main thing to come out of-- for Moab that came out of the uranium era?
Better roads for one thing. Better schools for another thing. Better phone service for another thing. Better supply houses. Better--more grocery stores, more super markets, more tourists.
You think it's been just kind of an overall improvement in the economy?
Yes. There's more jobs around.
What do you see as the future of the schools in Moab? Do you think you're going to keep on your present pace?
I think they'll level off a little bit. Just this next coming year I understand that we may have fewer students than we had last year, by how many I don't

HB: SG:

SG: HB:
know. Maybe a hundred. That's a rough guess.
Do you view this as more of a temporary thing or--?
I think there will be a leveling off. I think there
will be some growth, yes. I think that this will be-- 30

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
tourism I think has great possibility here in his Canyonland and so on. I t hink i t will become apace of retirement for people too.
SG: Do you think that the future of Moab is in these areas as opposed to the mining l ike it was before?
HB: Is what?
SG: Do you think that the future of the city will be in
an industry like tourism or as a retirement place as
opposed to being a center of mining?
HB: No, there'll be mining, I believe. There's a little
upsurge in the uranium mining now that's taking place and we don't want to forget oil. We don't want to forget potash and gas. See, all of these things came about since that time and maybe because of this uranium boom. Prospecting and so on. It all works in together.
SG: So you think that ---?--- that they now have are going to keep expanding?
HB: Yes, I think so.
SG: And tourism is just going to play one part of it? HB: Yes, just one part.
SG: Without being predominant or anything?
HB: No. No, it won't be predominant. However, I t hink i t will bring quite a lot of dollars to this area.
SG: As far as the teachers go, do most of them work 31

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
during the summer, or go on vacation?
HB:
SG:
HB: SG: HB:
SG:
HB:
Well, most of them work or go back to school. See, we have to keep our certificates up and go back to school. But most of them work.
Do you have any idea what kind of turnover rate the district has?
In school teaching?
Yeah.
I think you've already probably got those figures, haven't you? They'd be exact. From Mr. Sundwall?
Yeah, he was--well, I have to go back and get the figures he gave me. He just gave us impressions and I have to go back there now and get actual figures.
We have a turnover, but I don't think it's--! don't think it's excessive. All school districts have a turnover. Some of the lady teachers get married. There is a certain amount of retirement when they reach the age of retirement, and there's always a
turnover. But I don't think it's excessive.
Yeah, that's what I was wondering. The actual figure are there, but I was wondering what the impression of a teacher was in the school whether he viewed it as,
SG:
you know, excessive or high.
HB: No, it isn't high. And sometimes--we have quite a few
teachers that come here, new teachers,
young
32

 HAROLD BARTON # 1
teachers, and then come back after they've b n w y one year, two years. They want to come back.
SG: Is there anything else as far as the schools that we haven't covered that--
HB:
I think we've pretty well covered it. Since I've been here--we're a long ways from the larger centers, and this has a bearing on the turnover too. Maybe a young man and his wife doesn't like it because of the isolation. But after you've taught a couple of year that doesn't seem to be a problem. Maybe the first year it would be more of a problem. But I think the schools are good in this area. I think we can compare them with any town in the surrounding states and not be a bit ashamed of them. In fact, I think we could compare them with a lot of the larger Salt Lake schools and not be a bit ashamed of the schools here in Moab. I'm quite sold on the school system.
SG: Are there any other comments you would like to make as far as the city itself goes?
HB: Oh, it's just a nice, nice town to live in in winter, and little to hot in the summer, as you've already found out. And that's the big drawback. But it has
possibilities, and it's a town that I think is beginning to take real pride. In five years I think it will be a better town than it is now. But you like
33

      HAROLD BARTON # 1
it here. You think, "Oh, I could never live in a little town like that." And the first year it might be rough, but after that it'd be all right for you.
SG: Okay, thank you very much. HB: Thank you, gentlemen.
