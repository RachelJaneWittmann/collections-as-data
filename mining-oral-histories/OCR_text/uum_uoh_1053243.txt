 THIS INTERVIEW WITH MR. RALPH NOONAN IS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH AND CALIFORNIA STATE COLLEGE AT FULLERTON URANIUM INDUSTRY ORAL HISTORY PROJECT.
KB.: Mr. Noonan, a miner and prospector, had been previously interviewed ahout his experiences as a miner, but when I interviewed Mr. Johnny Delsey (?), a Navajo miner, he told me that he had asked Mr. Noonan to come into partnership with him on a claim that he had located
RN:
in Monument Valley. I want to explore this a little further with Mr. Noonan. Unfortunately, the first part of the tape recording was accidentally erased.
..¥I was involved with that because--1 know that the business arrangement would probably wind up being kicked around up there
in Window Rock, or something like that, and all it was, was an opportunity to develop some bad relations, as far as I was concerned. I just don't like to get mixed up--
KB: Bad relations with the Navajo people?
RN: ---?---Johnny---?---. As far as Johnny's concerned, there's
nothing I'd rather do more than go our with Johnny, with what little bit of know-how I have, and what machinery and help, and we'd work together on it. He wanted to go down there and work together on it. Which I ~ould be more than willing to do, but it's beyong a thing
like that. You just don't pick you up a partner and go out--anywhere,

 NOONAN P AGE 2
much less down on the reservation. As soon as y ou get down the r e , then you become involved with posting bonds. And there's always people down there that I was always afraid would take the wrong attitude, say, "Well, this guy's just down here. He's just found him a Navajo, and he's down here trying to hook him in on some kind of deal or something." And I just didn't want to ever become involved in it, that's all. But, I told Johnny he ought to try
to get some help from the agency down there, and look into it.
If he's got something, why, if there's anything of merit there, why, it could be developed and he'd realize something out of it. I'd help him however I could without becoming personally involved in
it, but ---?---
KB.: Well, I don't know. I talked to a couple of miners down on the reservation, and they claimed that they know where they could
stake some good claims, but that the Tribal Council refuses to
give them the claims because they didn't have any money or mach- inery. And yet they wouldn't allow them to go out and get a white partner to supply this, and so then their claims were taken up
hy someone at Window Rock because they could tell where the claims
were.
RN: Well, there's one little thing. For one thing, it's a little risky
to b.ecome involved in something like that because of---?--- with

 NOONAN PAGE 3
with a guy, and you get down there, and he gets in debt of some kind. Even though it may be nominal, a very small amount. And then maybe he's overlooked something, or for some reason, he gets put out of there, why, it could be a rough blow. But Johnny, I don't understand, exactly what rights he has out there, but if
he knows where there's something, I told him just to keep it under his hat, and to try to get something like that developed because
I'd rather see him--. 'Course these fellas'll go to work and
work in the mines, and they understand their jobs and everything about going in, breaking the rock, and hauling the ore, and all
that part, but they don't have even the vaguest idea of all that goes on at the top. There's contracts with the mills, and you've got to understand how you're monitoring your ore with the radiation equipment. There's probing holes, and fixing counters, and you have to get all that done. They don't realize all that has to be--has to--
KB,: There's more than just digging it out, huh?
RN: There's much, much more than just digging it out and hauling it
away.
KB.: Well, they really don't seem to have much of a head for money,
anyway, do they? What do they usually use their paychecks for, have you been able to tell?

RN: Well, I guess it varies with individuals same as anywhere else. I know some boys down there who have little farms. Over here is Red Sky, one of the finest men I've even known in my life. He's been comin' up here two or three times; he wants me to go down--I have
a little drill rig--he lives across the river and he has to go all the way around---?--- to get hack and get across that river.
They're talking about building a bridge across it. He's got a little place out there, and he thinks there's water there. He has to haul water now several miles to his place, but he thinks there's water there, around thirty, forty, fifty feet deep. Well, I've got a little drilling machine, and he worked for me, he knew me, he saw
me up there drilling these holes for uranium. And, well, he's
come back several, oh, several times wantin' me to come down there. I have a hard time--he can't even speak good English or understand it very well. His daughter comes with him to talk, but I tried
to explain to him that he had to get a permit for all this. I just
wouldn't drive down there and drill a water-well. Water drainage
is getting to be quite a part of the environmental picture, you know,
with more regulations, and whatnot. Well, he drove up to the State Water Engineers office---?--- just about two weeks ago, told me what all I'd have to do and what all he'd have to do to get his water-well down. So I turned it over to him, told him that I

 NOONAN PAGE 5
didn't want to post all that bond, get a water-well driller's licence, and all that sort of thing to go down there and drill a little hole. But there he is, and he's prudent, he's thrifty, he's one of the
b£st little workers I've ever had. He never gets in a hurry, but
he's as steady as he could be. There's a fellow named Key(?) Moustache down there. He was always interested in building up his place and getting more cows or this, that, and the other. There's
an attitude in the mine that I think they've picked up from White people in my business. There's a certain element of people in my business. They want to make big money and blow it all on Saturday night, see. That's kind of a reflection of the mine, I guess, mining need from the beginning. And maybe that--some of that attitude has
migrated over into some of these Navajo boys, but it's a natural thing with anybody. I've found that in any kind of construction
business all over the world that if a guy works hard, he plays hard, he lives hard, does everything. And so, when they get payed--some
of 'em get payed, they go down and they blow their check, I guess, and then some go in deb.t, too. I don't know, as far as that aspect's concerned, there's probably not a great deal of difference in many
ways than a cross-section of the Anglos, I don't know. There's some of them that are prudent and thrifty and they allow for the future, and some of them don't. There's no--I don't think there's

 NOONAN PAGE 6
any particular trait that's prevalent among them in that respect. But the point I really hope--the point I hope to see, and this has b.een something that's been with me maybe all my life really is the attitude of the United States Government and the people in America, especially, some of these people who write for the slick(?) mag- azines. They mean well, they're real dedicated, they're honest, they're real fine people, but there's--there's a certain attitude in these people, not just the Navajos, far as I'm concerned. It's als.o the Chicanos down in South Texas. But there's a certain attitude among those people that's entirely foreign to this Judeo- Christian concept. And we're trying to put and iron glove around
'em and say, "Now, this is the way you're gonna be, see, in order for you to have all the benefits of this society." Well, I think
a lot of people may be questioning some of those so-called benefits. For instance, down in old Mexico, anywhere along the river there
are a lot of families down there. They still take--they still have
what they call their siesta. That's the period after lunch. And,
I don't know what, it might be that there wouldn't be so many executives dying of heart attacks in this country if we relaxed
and took a little different attitude toward a few things. Those-- those kind of things I told these other girls about this story about
the fellow who--1 was on jury duty one day, and there was some kind

 NOONAN PAGE 7
of little celebration out here west of town, this one old woman went to the sherrif's office and filed a complaint against this man charging him with the rape of this girl there that was around,
I don't know, twelve, fifteen years old, or something. And this guy was around thirty or thirty-five. Anyhow, there was all this with the interpreter and everything, this whole thing was brought up in court. It was an extremely flimsy set of imformation and testimony that was given there to begin with. But, nevertheless, when we walked into that jury room, it was just almost a foregone conclusion that this guy was guilty. Well, I think that probably,
maybe, he was guilty of that act. I'm just not--I know I was thoroughly convinced, but the things that bothered me was that here there was not one ounce of consideration give to the fact that here was a completely different type of person, different human being who belonged to a different ethnic group. But, you
were just imposing on him your legal and moral standards without any consideration at all for what that society's concept of that act might have been. I don't think it was right. I'm not saying this was condonable or acceptable or anything, necessarily, but
I just think that there was a lack of an attempt to understand
their attitude toward this same thing, which in many places among these people is quite different than we have. And, of course, this

 NOONAN P AGE 8
may be the---?--- of the best. B.ut that disregard for the cultural b.ackground, and the social mechanics, and the social workings of those other ethnic groups--this total disregard for that is what I was always noticing--the abscence of that. And I don't know that it's the b.est thing in the world to try to have these people just forget everything in their entire historic background and try to convert them into our social arrangement or not. That's a question with me. But, that's getting quite a bit away from mining! But, nevertheless, these are the things that are reflected to me in
the Navajo people. The more I saw of 'em, the more I like 'em. They do some pretty ornery things, we think, but they have some other concepts and an attitude toward things on this old planet that I like. And I think th.ey're there---?--- ---?---
KB.: It would be a pity if it was all lost.
RN: Well, there's people here, or course, who have lived all their
lives with the people, and they can give you much more information than I can about them. But I guess to summarize it, I've enjoyed every minute. I've never had any regrets of hiring any of these
boys. I've found 'em to be dependable, I've found 'em to be honest,---?---. I'm talking about---?--- and that sort of thing. But, they're really and truly basically honest and remarkably in- telligent--very intelligent. I've never had any experience with

 NOONAN P AGE 9
the Utes; I understand that they have quite a different set of characteristics, I don't know. But I have nothing but admirat i on for the Navajos.
KB: How did you pay your men? Was it hourly or by contract?
RN: No, it was by the hourly wage.
KB.: Uh huh. Well, Mr. Noonan, I want to thank you very much for talking
to me.
RN: Well, it isn't much. ---?---
KB: You've given quite a bit of insight, hut, you know,---?---
RN: Well, I'm sure---?--- the kind of thing you're taking down. I
enjoyed talking about it.
