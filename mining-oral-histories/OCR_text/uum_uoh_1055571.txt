 THE FOLLOWING IS AN INTERVIEW BEING CONDUCTED BY DOROTHY ERICK WITH ARVILLA WARREN; SAN JUAN COUNTY RECORDER, AUGUST 1 2 , 1970, IN A ROOM ACROSS THE HALL FROM THE RECORDER'S FILES AT 88 NORTH MAIN, MONTICELLO, UTAH .
DE: You know it seems to me that one of the most important persons that played a part in this uranium rush was the county recorder and I'd like to have you tell us your name and when you became county recorder.
AW: My name is Arvilla E. Warren, I was appointed to the office of county recorder in April of 1952 to fill an unexpired term. I have served since; I have had three terms for election, two that were not contested.
DE: And you have an election coming up this coming fall? AW: Yes, I do. November 3 is the state and county election.
Oh, this is going to be all fouled up. DE: It's fine. Don't worry about a thing.
AW: I'd written down, well--
DE: Let me explain that, well, you will be able to edit this
and we talk in a little bit different manner than we write a thesis or something. So this is just to get you on tape and don't worry about--we'll just forget it's there and we'll just talk as if we were, as if we didn't have that on. Okay? All right. Now I know you've seen a
lot of things happen, both good and bad.
AW: Yes, I sure have. Many people became wealthy and many,
many thousands became poor, or broke during the uranium
boom.
DE: What are some of the things that come to mind when you

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
thing of the boom of the '50s after you were appointed.
AW: When I came in office and the uranium business had been going on for many years. Probably a new boom was starting and this was the reason that Charles H. Steen came to San Juan County possibly to seek his fortune. We had seen even before that, many miners and hopeful people. The Happy Jack mine was located and probably well under way long before Steen came, but I feel very sure that the real action began after Steen made his fabulous strike which spread over the country far and wide bringing many people during that period from various walks of life. Well, we had movie stars and wealthy people involved as well as foreigners who hoped to make something for this. As foreigners I would say three or five men who stayed in Grand Junction, but they came from Hawaii. We had two Englishmen who were in the United States on visa who came
hoping they might also be included, but I think the finishing touch was when five Eskimos walked in accompanied by two local people.
DE: Now I'd like to ask a question about foreigners coming in, or people who were not citizens of the United States coming in to stake claims, was this a legal thing at that time?
AW: No, I think it's quite impossible. I think they found this out. They realized a lot of the uranium staking was
2

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
done on the Indian reservation of which San Juan County has a very large area. This could only be done according to law by the Indians themselves or a white man who is signing on location with an Indian. This gave the Indian the prior rights but they did create some claims in the
DE: AW:
Indian reservation.
Now from Hawaii, England, and from Alaska?
Alaska and Hawaii had not yet become states and the men on the visa from England I'm sure didn't have the privilege of actively taking part in anything in the United States and I'm very doubtful about the others because well, it was probably more or less a lark for them.
You think they came here because of the publicity from Steen then?
Yes, they definitely, I think that the big story spread so rapidly about Steen's mine and about the Happy Jake mine and everybody thought this was a pot of gold. It could, the 1954-1955 rush could well be compared to the California Gold Rush.
DE:
AW:
DE: Can you remember some of them, distinctly, some of the people that came in here and some of their problems?
AW: Usually the biggest problem was having enough money to pay for the recording; that they had seemed to be carried away and staked more claims, made more maps perhaps than
3

 ARVILLA WARREN #1
they had required recording fees which sometimes to them was very embarrassing.
DE: What were these people doing, coming in by themselves or did they bring their families or how did they go about this?
AW: Very few brought their families. Very few wives accompanied them. In some instances older couples came. Particularly I remember two ladies coming from California. They bought mining claims, they had mining claims located for them in the rugged areas of the LaSal mountains which was near Steen's holdings.
DE: Well, that is one of the things that you remember it later you can fill it in too. Well, did they appear to have a lot of money?
It was my impression they did. They drove their own car and although they were old, the one lady was very alert and her name was Susan Sheret. She has since, has since
deceased. The partner's name is Mrs. Francis Coombs and they were from San Diego, California. It was a regular thing to see them appear at the time proof of labor became due which is the required annual work on mining claims. Mrs. Coombs came later and tried to continue although her partner was no longer with her and the last time I heard from her she was bedfast in San Diego. She sent me some very beautiful pictures as a gift from her
AW:
4

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
home. As to now, I believe that Mrs. Coombs is also dead.
DE: Well, did she actually do some staking on her own? Did she go out and walk these--?
AW: No they hired, no they hired, no they hired the work done.
DE: And your work has to be done by, is it July 1st?
AW: September 1st. They extended this period during the t ime they had such terrific snowstorms and people were unable
to reach even the mining claims of the higher mountains, Elk Mountains and Blue Mountains because of the deep snow still in June. The law passed that they would not be required to hand work in or record it until September 1st, which gave a real break that year.
DE: And that's why your summer months then are very, very-- AW: Rushed. Particularly the month of August.
DE: That's the month in right now. Going back to the days of
the first so-called boom, what is the largest number that you can remember having recorded in one day or having accepted in one day?
AW: The largest number, and this was very unusual, 6,000 instruments.
DE: Now would these be brought in by individuals or, and in large claims?
AW: Large groups of claims. This was usually individuals or partnerships or sometimes large companies. Usually t his
5

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
was a time when the AEC had released land which they had previously withheld and drilled. So the miners felt it was a real break to rush in and record on the land that the AEC had probably discovered something.
DE: Did you have trouble with people trying to record more than one claim?
AW: Well, this was always a problem but it isn't our problem. We accept anything people bring in to record. No question in our minds that there are conf1icts, overlaps and overstaking, but my job is merely to record what they
bring in, let them decide who has the preference.
DE: And I notice that you mentioned that you accept and record. How do you differentiate if one comes in before
the other one?
AW: I learned that lesson first when I became a recorder. I
heard quite a discussion the first day I worked between the recorder and two men about who had come in with claims first in one day and it had been a full year. So when I was appointed recorder the first thing I did was buy two new timing machines and the person that came in first would be required to stand and see their instrument timed and when there was an extreme rush we would line them up. Th~y came in their order through the door, make their receipt count the instruments, accept the money and then after the person remained standing while the time
6

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
was on their instrument and they could verify that the exact instrument fell in or der, instrument.
DE: Did you then have to sign something or was it just all done on the instrument?
AW: No it's all taken care of before it came in. This is not another unusual thing to find them undated, not properly signed and we have some very efficient help who have worked overtime and far beyond the call of duty calling attention to the people: you need a notary seal, you need a notary, you need to date this, this instrument doesn't seem to be complete. And that's been our way of handling
it right until today.
DE: Well, I knew it has been and still is one of the biggest
jobs in the country when you appeal that all of these things have to be staked, have to be claimed and have to be recorded. These claims do change hands quite often?
AW: Very often. Big companies now seem to be in possession of some of the most desirable claims. However, there's a great many of them being used on the stock market with only a small royalty reserved which if the claim is never
mined, the person who owned and worked so hard to stake
it originally may never receive any benefit.
DE: Did you get to know some of these people very well?
AW: Yes, I became acquainted with wonderful people from all over the United States. Lawyers, businessmen, indiv iduals
7

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
and many of them have kept in touch with me. I have received many lovely gifts and other ways of recognition from people throughout the United States.
DE: I understand that this is not, at that time it was not unusual for you to put in many, many hours.
AW:
It's the truth. From April in 1953 until December 24th we practically ran the office day and night. We had two shifts of girls working and a total of 18 deputies. At six in the morning one group came to work and they would work until nine o'clock. Many of them had families and they would go home. At nine o'clock another crew came on and the girls that did the photostating and they would work until five in the evening. Then at five the other group would come back and work until nine or ten, how long before they got too tired. And after that my faithful husband, Burt Warren who is now dead would come to the office with me to get work ready for the next day
and to find a book that had been photostated and readied, made into a book that day.
I thought it was interesting the small number of books up to the time of the great uranium boom and then from then on it really mushroomed. I'd like to have you tell us
DE:
about that.
AW: The books in the beginning were very small handwritten
and the copy originally was located in Bluff, Utah. It 8

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
later moved to Monticello. They kept wonderful records which has been beneficial to us. In 1952 the county purchased the first photostat machine and t his was a real blessing because when I came here they had worked in book 19. At the present time we are in book 485. This is photostat book alone. You realize of course that each photostat books is accompanied by many, many other books. Indexes of various kinds, a complete land or tract description index wherever possible, especially on patented land, are kept in my office. This is for the benefit of. oil companies, individuals who may want privacy or to look up the information themselves rather than at the expense of abstract companies or attorneys to handle it for them.
DE:
In other words they can come in and do their own abstract work without and have all of it here?
Very easily.
AW:
DE: You have it completely indexed then by book, cross
AW:
indexed?
Cross indexed. We have since 1954 a cross index under the name of the claim; under the name of the locator. This
helps the individual if they know either, so they may search in either book. Also the demand on the books at times is very great. We also have proof of labor indexes and miscellaneous books which if we have a real crowd in
9

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
the office many of them can still be looking up information they need and using separate books.
DE: Now some claims are, well many claims you said have the same name. Does this prove a problem?
AW:
Not especially. We have many by the same names and some in different areas. And if the area is described at all why we can soon eliminate the one that they are not looking for. We have some very unusual funny names of claims. It seemed to be the mood the person was in, they would name their claim. I remember one time a man came in. His clothes were badly torn and he had named his claim No Pants. It seemed he had slid down a rocky hillside and so he thought it was a fitting name of his claim. Still later another man came and he named several claims No Jeep and numbered them different numbers, he was very excited. He was working with some negroes with a California license plate who were the only ones he had seen in the area, but when he came from staking claims he had no jeep and no mining equipment and no camping
equipment, so his claims were well-named. Some of the better producing claims and some of the ones that sold for the most money in the Steen area were named all brands of whiskey and beer. This gave me the feeling that this man was really thirsty and that he perhaps was
acquainted with all of them. 10

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
DE: Was this by one individual?
AW: DE:
AW:
DE: AW:
Y es.
What were some of the happy things that you can remember about these people coming in to stake claims?
It was a happy occasion. I enjoyed every moment of it. It seems that everyone was enthusiastic and happy and a very happy beginning for them.
Did most of them seem to know what they were doing? Well, it's really doubtful, but they were all very anxious to get into the field and put up their stakes and to have their name on the locations which is required by the ground as well as recorded in the recorder's office within 30 days. And it was more or less of a lark. They were camping out and yet they were going to become rich. What group of people, or should I say from what state did most of the newcomers come to do their prospecting? Perhaps from ever state in the Union. We had Four Corners area whichá included Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and
Arizona and I'm sure that all of these areas were very highly staked, but in the meantime big strikes have been made at Grants, New Mexico which took a little pressure off of our area.
Well, did the Californians come in here to actually work or did they come in here mostly for the promotion?
No, they came with the idea of becoming wealthy and the
DE:
AW:
DE:
AW:
11

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
work was necessary to stake the claims. It's really a big
job. They are allowed 20 acres in one location and some
of this country is very rugged.
DE: That's really putting it mildly I would say, after flying
over it today. Well, the reason I ask about California, they always say that California always comes into Utah to hunt deer and I just wondered if they had been in here hunting deer before this. I wondered if any of those came back to stake claims.
AW: The type of people that came to stake claims were not the type that come to hunt deer. The deer hunters--we have wonderful deer hunting and large numbers of deers taken every year. These people look forward from one year to the next to take their vacation, to get a little better equipment; now to bring their trailer houses, to bring their wives, and if nothing else to show them the scenic country. Usually they get their deer.
DE: Well, then would you describe the people that came in though to get uranium as those who came in just to take and not to really enjoy the place?
AW: Oh no. They had high hopes of big mills, more production, producing uranium on their own.
DE: Did they seem to be acquainted with what really was expected of them, had to be done?
AW: Yes, most of them would have in the group someone who was
12

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
familiar with mining, who had previous experience.
DE: Whether it had been with uranium or some other metal or some other ore.
AW: That's right.
DE: Going back to the people themselves, did you become well-
acquainted with some that came in as newcomers and not
those just around in the town or area?
AW: Yes, very much so. I have friends from Long Beach,
California who still have claims in the White Canyon area. They're wealthy people. They make an annual visit, sometimes more often. I've been invited to their homes many times.
DE: Do they keep this and do their assessment work?
AW: Yes, definitely. They still feel there's a big future in
that area.
DE: Is this down near the Happy Jack?
AW: Yes. In the general area.
DE: Does everything seem to be an air of anxious expectation?
AW: That's right.
DE: Then what happened when people didn't seem to get their
ore or it was too much out of their reach? What really
started to take place?
AW: We had five brothers from Oklahoma who are very wealthy
came out here and spent a great deal of money. Brought their wives each summer. Did the assessment work on their
13

 ARVILLA WARREN #1
claims, and I'm sure eventually they realized that the thing was out of their grasp and for the past few years I have neither seen or heard from them although I knew five of them real well.
DE: Did they ever mine any of the ore?
AW: Not to my knowledge. They didn't ship ore. The name was
Thomas brothers from--
DE: In other words they were, they were merely stakers of
claims?
AW: This was to be a big investment for them I think.
DE: I understand that many prospected and found the claims
and then sold them. AW: That is true.
DE: Did you hear any stories about, along that line?
AW: Do you want me to tell one?
DE: Yes.
AW: Jesse Bronson-Cooper family did very well when he sold
the Happy Jack mine.
DE: Did they have any other holdings other than the Happy
Jack?
AW: Perhaps 8 to 10 claims? This was always done to protect
a claim that is really the valuable one. They stake other claims around them for protection. They were later patented I think.
DE: You know I'd like to have and on tape to explain the 14

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1 patenting process.
AW:
The patenting of a mining claim is quite difficult. It takes an absolute true survey and qualified work plus much tedious working o-f the claim, properties staked, properties surveyed, and perhaps takes two years to receive a patent. After the claim is patented they, taxes are paid to the state of Utah. This is done in lieu of the usual proof of labor which is done annually on unpatentad claims.
Uh huh. Proof of labor, is that one hundred dollars per claim per year?
That's right.
Has it changed over the years?
No, the audit has not changed and the price has not changed to my knowledge. However, we can almost say as a barometer, the number of claims each year that have been dropped by the number of proofs of labor that come in. This is very interesting and we very often tally them just for our own benefit. And we find that it's really stabilized as we perhaps tally these at the end of the year finding there are 49,000 that have proof of labor done or 29,000 which were in the low ebb. It's going to
be very interesting this year to see how many were done, with the old claims still in good standing plus the claims that were staked during our recent rush from 1969,
DE:
AW: DE: AW:
15

 ARVILLA WARREN #1
1966, I'm sorry, through 1968.
DE: In other words, some of the.claims that were prior to 1966 have still been--?
AW: Kept in good standing.
DE: Uh huh, and then from '66 on the-re were restaking or new
staking and [we're] anxious to know now whether or not these are continuing. Is this partly because of end of the stretch-out period by the AEC?
AW: This is possible. However, I think that as some people became discouraged and gave up certain areas other people became encouraged and restaked the same property.
DE: I was wondering if this was any barometer of the so called recession that we've been encountering in the last few years.
AW: This is possible. It's very expensive to drill, however drilling on property can be very beneficial due to the fact that when they do drilling to do the assessment work, they're also hoping to strike ore.
DE: Now if they have this proof of labor is it usually by drilling? Do they have to put on this proof of labor what they have done and on which claims?
Yes, Yes. The proof of labor forms call for the type of
work that was done and on what particular claims and the amount of work accomplished and since it's very expensive to drill, it doesn't take l_ong to, to do the work.
AW:
16

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
However when the claims are conti guous, r oad building geographical work, development of any type, are considered to be proof of labor.
DE: When you see where they have to put roads into it's- AW: Yes, you can see why it's so expensive.
DE: You can see why it's so expensive, right. It's also expensive to haul their ore out of there if they do have a strike. Has, have you had any unusual dealings with the, some of those who have been prospecting?
AW: The relationship I've had with people in the office has been very rewarding to me. I've enjoyed everyone that come in. I love people and the human element has been most in my mind. However, there have been some very vivid cases where the Sheriff's department has been involved with the people who were breaking the law even to the point of requiring numerous deputies and various people to open gates into forest land or into parts of land that were opened for public staking and this very often was done at gun point. Sometimes equipment had to possessed and we had one very vivid thing at the time that census
was being taken in 1960. The census taker went into a camp and was held hostage by the people. Apparently they were doing something that they did not want known. The sheriff called and went there alone to be met by a man
with a machine gun. He didn't make any resistance at all, 17

 ARVILLA WARREN # 1
but went back to his car and shortwaved for help and this proved to be one of the cases where the three people
DE:
AW:
DE: AW: DE:
AW:
DE:
involved in the mining venture moved to different areas, took other people as hostage, did illegal things and now all three are serving time in penitentiaries.
Was it because of their claims or something else that they were doing?
It was in regards to the mining claims but they seemed to think that because they staked a claim on public domain that they owned the whole world, at least the whole area. Were these people from out of state?
Colorado.
And they were aware of mining and what went along with it.
They had their operation headquarters in Denver, however they were very interesting people. One of them was a graduate from Williams and Mary's College in Virginia and the other two partners were also well educated.
Is this because they thought they were going to get rich quick at someone else's expense?
Perhaps. They surely.tried everything.
AW:
DE: Well, a machine gun alone is illegal.
AW: They had to repossess all their equipment and it was here
for a long time. They finally wound up in Gold, Arizona and took an old man and an old lady as hostage and
18

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
luckily they were caught in this act which was the final?
DE: AW:
DE:
AW:
DE:
AW:
DE:
AW:
Was this after the last one of 1966?
No, it was following this, during the time of the United States census in 1960. It was a census taker that they took also.
You were right. I should have written that down 1960. Have they ever put any stalls on those mines?
Well, not that I've heard of. Sometimes they acted like they might have done.
The people that came in to have things recorded, how did they act, how where they dressed? Were they the typical miner as we've been led to believe in the TV westerns? Well, this is western country and they came in western dress. That's the usual, prepared to rough it.
Could you really tell those who struck it rich from those who didn't?
No, but I could tell the ones that were already rich when they came in. They were more demanding. (laughing)
DE: That's what I was wondering. They would not have been humble.
AW: No.
DE: But they had to wait their turn just as anyone else.
AW: But sometimes became quite pertul!li:>ed or impatient because
they did have to wait their turn to be served.
DE: Well, you mentioned something about someone who came in
19

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
here and they stayed quite a while or some of those who didn't quite make it out of the mines. Some that you remembered when we were talking.the other day.
AW: You mean the ones that were, didn't make money and then tried to go home?
DE: Uh huh.
AW: Yes, this was a boom town. There was not enough rooms in
the hotels or motels. People were taking people into their homes, renting rooms. Some of them desirable, some of then undesirable characters. We had more restaurants and one in particular was across the street from the court house. We very often ran over to get a sandwich. I remember this particular man had invested quite heavily in mining claims and was working very hard to run a cafe, and when the time came that he had received enough money and felt that it was time to go home, although he was separated from his wife and his family, he thought this
might be a way of reuniting and he left here in very gay spirits and died on the train of a heart attack 50 miles from his home. Later his wife and son came here most eager to find out if he had more.
DE: Sounds like it's a lot, a lot of things that went on that related to people in just their ordinary lives.
AW: But you understand that this was not just the uranium boom. We were also in the middle of a very large oil
20

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
discovery. So people as a whole were quite different. We had the oil men; we had the ordinary miner and there was such an influx of people. At this time they built the El Paso Natural gas plant at Mont ezuma Creek , Utah, and I think during that period they built 75 homes , t wo and three bedroom homes. This was all trucked in, and through a little research I found out that in establishing an oil well there might be as many as 225 varied industries
DE:
AW:
DE: AW: DE: AW:
involved. This to me was very interesting.
Then you had both at the same time to record and to try and keep them from tramping on each other's toes.
Well, they were in different areas, and most of the oil action at that time was on the Navajo Reservation.
Was this down at Anna?
Uh huh.
And this all recorded here in your office?
Yes. Anything in Utah is probably recorded in this office. Later a discovery was made at Big Indian area of oil. This is also an isolated place and now we have a recycling plant there and the ore, oil, how do you irradicate?
It will be out in the transcription. The oil--
DE:
AW: The oil is now being pumped in a pipeline from the
recycling plant near the Big Indian area to the El Paso Natural plant, the Natural Gas plant at Montezuma Creek;
21

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
from there the pipeline enlarges. Natural gas is shipped to Farmington, New Mexico. The gasoline goes on to the Four Corners area where it meets a 36 inch pipeline which goes into California. This oil is a cooperative thing from the Four Corners area also.
Did any of those interested in uranium have anything to do with this ah--
No, very little.
In other words they were like two separate groups that moved in and they did not mingle.
That's right.
DE:
AW: DE:
AW: DE:
AW:
There you've seen Monticello enlarge and now again I understand the number has gone down.
This is true. Perhaps Moab, Utah, received the most benefits due to the fact that Steen lived there, built homes, hired many people. Also the potash production now and for this we're really happy. We would like to see Monticello built into a city the size of Moab and perhaps someday it will. However, our main industry is farming, cattle rasihg and sheep raising, has always been the
case, and we're very, very proud of the production of pinto beans and wheal which is shipped to various points in the United States and used by great extent by the United States Army or Army Services.
DE: Well, this type of operation then that you have around 22

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
here, other than the ur anium and the mine staking is more stable, is it not?
Yes, the economy, County Commissioner Calvin Black told me however that this year the oil had held as well. This
AW:
DE:
AW:
is not stabilized within our county. We have one of the larger oil fields in the United States. Urani um r ight now has been very slow. We're all hoping that the new company, Rio Algum Corporation will prove something that we're all anxious to know. Do we or don't we have ore? They're drilling to a great dept which no one else has been able to do.
Some of the other places have had to go much deeper and go through where they thought they might have found ore and found none though they went on down. Is this what they're doing around here then with this Rio Algum?
Rio Algum's attention is to build a very deep bed. They believe the ore to be at a depth much deeper than ordinary miners have drilled. And of course new types of drilling equipment are being brought in by various companies that will drill much deeper than anything that has so far produced in the area.
DE: They you have sensed there is an optimism?
AW: Some people have felt discouraged but really the optimism
is still felt. We haven't given up any hope at all.
DE: Back when the regular, the first boom was here, did
23

 A R V I L L A W ARREN # 1
people really feel that they were part of the new generation, the new atomic age or was it, do you feel, mostly for their own benefit? The bomb had already been exploded and they had discussed even nuclear reactors.
AW: We had, it had the test that Al Migardo in White Sands and we were mostly aware of the necessity of producing uranium and vanadium and I'm sure that the people that came in felt that they were in a new era and they were going to help greatly in the production of uranium.
DE: Were there any fears about it expressed at least?
AW: No, none whatsoever. Perhaps they didn't realize the
definite danger.
DE: Other than the ultimate use of it. I see. Well, I know we
could go on and on but I know that you have to get back
to your, very busy-- AW: Play that back.
DE: Okay. There is one thing I'd 1ike to have cleared up though--it is about the taxes on the claims. We understood áabout the patented claims. They do tax on those.
AW:
Other than that the only claims taxed would probably be the ones in production. This is done by the local assessor in connection with the Utah State Tax Commission. The taxes then are assessed and collected by the state of Utah. In some instances these were very
24
Lf03e ;!5 +olloWs f 5e ?!...qJ

facilities which I fel t coul d never have been done. We have swimming pools, golf courses. Most of the opportunities came to us from this production of oil and uranium.
Would you say they were about even in their taxed production.
No, at one time the production of uranium ore was higher. Later oil became the main factor, that their oil field was established.
When would this uranium have been higher? About what time?
Perhaps during the peak years of assessed valuation. In 1954 the assessed valuation of San Juan County was three million eight hundred and seventy-nine dollars. I'm not reading it right.
Three million eight hundred and seventy nine thousand and seventy one. That was in 1954 and then we go up to-- The peak. ¥
That's 19--I can't, 1360 and then you had a peak year in 1960?

And how much was that?

DE: And this was after and they were, after they had been 26

having all these discoveries and they were starting to produce.
They were producing.
So there is a difference from the time they were staking the claims when the time they had actually done work and started to produce.
That is right. The assessed valuation remained quite stable for a few years and then began to increase greatly.
And then when did it start to taper off?
Immediately after the peak it went down each year slowly. And now in 1970 it has run down to--
Forty-seven thousand, four hundred and twenty--Forty seven million, four hundred and twenty-six thousand, four hundred and thirty-one dollars. This I feel is still very good. We're still not a broke county.
So between 1954 and 1970 you have gone up and still you're not down to where you started?
Not by a long ways.
This has been a great deal then to continue your upgraded
economy and your better facilities, right?
AW: This is right. We've had some very fine stable men for country commissioner~ who have worked well and used the money for the best benefit of the county, including
improved roads. Because we are such a large county,

covering more area than any other county in the state, we have more than 1,500 miles of roads to be maintained and rebuilt and more being built into the scenic areas, such as Canyonlands, Halls Crossing, Hovenweep; many other beautiful areas.
Well, when you say 1,500 miles of roads does this mean that you are, they are already in and they are being maintained now?
No, not essentially. Most new roads being built always.
DE:

1,500 was just an early--
Well, in other words you are gradually increasing the number of miles of road that is passable?
Yes this is true and much road has been built and
improved through state roads and with federal aid.
You were going to mention some of the people that you recall did come into the state---?---. Once you said something about movie stars.
Well, of course, the movie stars didn't come personally. They were in the background; Roy Rogers, George Montgomery, such noted people as Dale Webb, many others
probably tttat I have forgotten.
DE: Was this mostly investment money?
AW: .I'm sure it was. We had lots of money being invested by
people who never did appear. We even had people come in that were sent to invest this money or to use it, didn't

appear either. Much to the--
DE: Would you get inquiries as to what had happened?
AW: Yes very often. The FBI was very active in those days. They used my books greatly and with the usual crossroads
into Colorado and New Mexico, we had many problems that concerned the law enforcement officers and many types of people going through; some of them staying over, a lot of them broke. It created a real problem.
DE: So with the increase of the size of the town and the newcomers coming in usually increase a few of your problems there. Did many of these people actually stay?
AW: A lot of them are local people and they live here and they certainly have shown by their lovely homes the value of the money they received. No actually the ones that came did not remain. However, this place is very exciting to people and they always seem to come back, and in many instances do, now on vacation usually.
DE: Well, I would like to ask you about this one person that you mentioned that did have so much publicity and seemed to start all this--Charles Steen. Did he stay around in this area?
AW: Charles and Manie Lee were very good friends of our family before he actually made this discovery. At the time they were living in Moab in a tar paper shack and
after they became wealthy they made trips to Europe and

great during the uranium boom. One production company was the Gem, Incorporated, who are no l onger in business, but shipped hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of ore
from San Juan County. These were in the general area, also, of the Steen production which was taxed by the State Tax Commission. So you see San Juan County of the town of Monticello did not always get the full benefit. However our assessed valuation raised from the time I came here from what we call a cow county and about 7th in classification of counties, to number two county in the peak of the boom and our assessed valuation became near the same value as Utah County, Weber County, and Salt Lake County.
DE: Where you had your colleges and your bigger towns. How did they arrive at any assessed value other these men going in and, you must have had some--?
On the ore projection and the payments of ore through the milling.
AW:
DE:
AW:
So the amount of that came out then, and that which was hauled to the mills was their basis?
San Juan County used their money very well at this time. They built a beautiful hospital. There was not any country, a clinic ih Blanding. We have a rest home and a
hospital at Montezuma Creek. We have good airports. We have beautiful school buildings and many recreational

he will realize the great income that he once had before, because I'm sure that he worked very hard to gain this in the first place and as a person and a family, they're highly respected by me at least.

No, he was very generous. He owned airplanes. He had leased building at the old Moab airport and each year he gave a public party inviting everyone in the county and it was in the form of a barbecue. He had a caterer from Grand Junction and some of the finest entertainment that could be brought in from outside places and dance music, every type of hospitality. And he shared it with everyone
in the county and in Grand county.
Have you seen these people recently?
No, I haven't seen Steens for a number of years.
Now where will he have to record his-claims if he makes them over around Escalante and Kanab?
They have been recorded in Kanab at the county courthouse, which is the county seat.
It has been rumored that he did go into bankruptcy. Was this just rumor or was it partly fact? But not that it would record it here on anything.
We have on file in this office large, terrifically large

Shumway family in Blanding perhaps, Mr. Balsely in Moab and the Bronson and Cooper family in Monticello are some that really benefitted.

There were many who tried promotional activities, organized companies, sold stock, and a lot, I would say were very dishonest and got by with it for a

The promoters really didn't make much headway then with your individual prospectors and miners in this area? This is very true. People worked hard for the money that they did make and they were not about to spend it in a way which they would lose it.
Well, I do notice that you have a lot of, at least they appear to be, relatively new and lovely homes. Is this all a result of the uranium boom?
on the other hand we still go back to the industry of farming, cattle raising and sheep raising.
Did you have some articles?

journals that were sent to me by geologists or attorneys, some who thought I would enjoy reading these articles and I've kept them for my personal scrapbook.

I'm most happy to help in any possible way and will be happy in the future if you care to have anymore information that you might write for. I'd be most happy to send it to you.
