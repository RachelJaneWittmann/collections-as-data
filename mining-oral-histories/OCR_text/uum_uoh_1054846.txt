 THIS IS AN INTERVIEW FOR THE URANIUM INDUSTRY ORAL HISTORY PROJECT JOINTL Y SPONSORED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH AND CALIFORNIA STATE COLLEGE AT FULLERTON. SUZANNE SIMON I S INTERVIEWING WITH MR. CARL MAHON AT 377 WEST FOURTH SOUTH, BOX 298, BLANDING, UTAH ON AUGUST 9, 1970. [TAPE #1.]
SS: Why don't you start by telling me something about your background.
CM: Well, I was born and raised over by Cortez, Colorado. As a kid I ran around a lot in Kelmo Canyon and its drainage, which lays just north of Sleeping Butte Mountain. There was a 1ittle talk of ore back in those days in what was known as sandstone. We found a whole lot of brown marbles, and they would vary in
size from the size of a matchhead to as big as a hen's egg, but they were all real round and black. So there had been a little talk of vanadium and silver and a lot of different types of ore. It wasn't long after the Star Mine was located over near Mankin, Colorado, when they took a 76 pound nugget out, which kind of made us young fellows go to looking. We sent them in to the school mine at Golden and they sent back an analysis of the ore that we had found, and it turned out to be manganese and iron. It had been rolled in a stream bed at one time and had become round. And as the sand had hardened, the marble had stayed intact, and they were harder than the sandstone. So in a lot of places they had eroded out and were protruding from the surface of the rock. So

 CARL MAHON 2
that's probably the first time I became much
interested in mining. Then later on--
SS: How old were you then?
CM: Oh, probably fourteen or fifteen. I was raised on a
ranch and Dad had cattle when I was a kid. I was out all the time and rode a lot after the cattle. Then Dad lost his cattle in the depression and then I was interested in horses and cattle. I kept helping the neighbors whenever there was a chance, usually for nothing, just to get the chance to help. Then later on I found some silver ore float south of Goodman Point. That was the area I was born and raised in, and we looked and looked and looked and we never could find any, where the float came form, but it was a good specimen of pure ore. Then in 1942 I came to Monticello, when I packed Ross Mussman's guests out from his dude ranch out there and became interested in this country and met my wife. A year later, or a year and a half later we were married. Then in 1945 we came to Monticello to make our home. There was quite a little bit of mining activity in vanadium in those days. Running around in the different areas I saw quite a little bit of mining activity and became interested in geology. So I began to read everything that I could get ahold of. A friend of
2

 CARL MAHON 2
mine had a bunch of geology textbooks from Utah State and I borrowed these and studied those real good.
During the uranium boom I got to work with a lot of geologists and I pumped all of them for everything I could get out of them. In 1950, I had trucks and did some trucking of livestock and wheat throughout the area, and then Haigh and Doyle Perkins wanted to do some prospecting in the Red Canyon area, Red and White Canyon area. So we made a deal and they used
some of my horses and mules and I transported them out to the Red House and then we were to be partners on any claims or anything we might find. We spent--I guess they spent a month or six weeks going in there looking around. They got up on Five Points and they found some ore there. Some thought it was ore and some of them thought it was ochre. They got in a big argument; they didn't have a geiger counter with them, or they had bumped it and it wasn't working, I'm not right sure what the deal was, but they decided that they would have it analyzed before they staked a claim. So they brought it in and had an analysis run on it, and it was good uranium ore. By the time they got back to stake it Ed Beard from Dove Creek had staked it. He did some work on it, not a lot, he did a little bit of digging around and sold
3

 CARL MAHON 2
it to Col. Sitton for $40,000.
ss: CM:
Do you know what that---?--- called it?
They are what? Canyon #1 is the main mine, but they were in there in the fall of '50 is when they did that prospecting. That's when Ed Beard staked them,
just a few days after they had found it, and [they] got in this mighty argument.
Did you go with them, or had you just supplied--?
I had a job and I hauled their horses and equipment out and furnished them two or three saddle horses and two or three mules and then they were to count me in as a full partner. But they never did find anything that was any good. So that kind of took care of that part of the country for that time. I was in Muldoon in Dune Creek, and we staked some uranium claims there. I went to work for Mack Dalton in Muldoon Creek that fall, the fall of '50, worked there for two years and there were quite a lot of claims, and I kept looking around and we staked some claims; they
SS: CM:
didn't show too much uranium.
SS: What did you call those, do you remember?
CM: No, I don't right now. I believe they were the Poor
Off Claims. But then I moved down to the Perkins Ranch, went to work for Calvin and Richard Perkins. I kept looking around for uranium and one thing and
4

 CARL MAHON 2
another. There were some pretty good uranium veins showing on a school section there and I went to check into it and found that some Shumways had already had
SS: CM:
SS: CM: SS:
CM:
it leased.
Now what area is this?
Well, it is Montezuma Creek Canyon and it's just between the mouth of Dove and Monument Canyon. I can give you the range and township and the whole business if you want that part of it.
Well, that wouldn't be too much good.
Well, that's what I was thinking. Anyhow, I didn't-- What I didn't know was if you had left Montezuma
area, working at the Perkins Ranch.
No, both ranches are on Montezuma Creek, and we were quite busy there with the livestock. I was in charge of the cattle, and helped some with the sheep and did some ranching, some of the farming and kind of oversaw it. Everytime we would get around and get to looking, we would kind of keep our eyes open for ore. Then the uranium boom really, you know, went to
picking up. Bean had a big strike up there and a lot of people were out prospecting. Different people had kind of suggested that a person might do pretty well out prospecting instead of working there on the ranch, but I kind of felt that a steady income was
5

 CARL MAHON 2
better than a lot of hope. So I kind of stayed there. Some of the fellows had got out and they struck ore close to the stream. We staked about 23 stakes in Montezuma Creek. There was a fellow from Durango, and
I can't remember his name, and he had a trailer sales over there, and he came over and he wanted to stake and he wanted to stake some claims, and he wanted us to show him a place to stake claims. Melvin Dawson and I showed some of his men where to stake, and we staked 23 claims and sold these with an override for $1,000. And then we were--I had a Navajo boy who was herding the buck sheep and I had him helping me do some fencing on the ranch. So to kind of be fair about the deal I would go and help him round up his sheep in the evening. One evening I was east of the Montezuma Creek Ranch and I saw what looked like ore, but it was up in the Brushy Basin formation, and there hadn't been any ore found in the Brushy Basin formation at that time. So I was quite sure that it must be ocher, but it looked awful good. I was in quite a hurry, it was in the spring of the year and there was lots of work to do. This was in the spring of '54. I tried to get Melvin Dalton to come down and help me or come with me and we would stake this. He was busy and I was busy and we were always going to
6

 CARL MAHON 2
do it, but we never did quite. One day Melvin, Mack and I met some prospectors up on Montezuma Creek, and they were students from some eastern college and they proved their money better. They decided to go out and
stake some uranium claims and make themselves a fortune. They took and stayed out just as long as they possibly could and they just barely had enough money to get back home and start working up another fortune when--and they didn't even have money enough to buy cigarettes. This one fellow, let me see, we bought--he was auctioning off his camp, his camp
iron, his geiger-counter and a lot of camping gear that they didn't feel that they would need, in order to get money enough to go home. [From] this one fellow I bought his binoculars, and he charged me, I believe I paid him $10.00 for them. I had to throw in a package of cigarettes because he hadn't had a smoke for three days and he was kind of anxious to be in the habit. So we bought, oh, I don't know, between the bunch of us, we bought about $50.00 to $75.00
worth of equipment from them. Ropes, binoculars, geiger-counters, stove, tent, I don't know what all. But along this school section that I spoke of before there was a pretty good showing of uranium and vanadium just about 150 feet from the main used gate
7

 CARL MAHON 2
or the dip fence there. There was a gate in there, and about all the prospectors that came along went through this gate, and as long as the livestock was
in there the gate was kept closed. I never did see anybody go over to this little deposit, and it was quite amusing because lots of times I would see as many as seven or eight people a day prospecting that school section, and we had a bunch of cattle in there and I could see them all. It was kind of odd to ride up to some of those people, a lot of them thought they were being real greedy and thought nobody knew what they was doing. Some of them thought they were way, way, way away from town and everything and that you wouldn't have enough to eat and some of them would offer you food and things 1ike that. So you just never knew for sure what the reason was going to be, it was really comical. A lot of people didn't know how to stake claims, they would have "southeast of Blanding, Utah, 25 miles" or something like that. Others of them would set it in by degrees and minutes and really put them in proper. I know we were up in Squaw Creek there one day and we found 13 claims within 300 feet of each other, 13 different claims laying different directions, one right on top of the other one. We unfolded the notices there, we got
8

 CARL MAHON 2
quite a kick out of it, and we unfolded this one and this one said, "This claim starts at this monument and runs 300 feet west, 300 feet east and 1500 feet straight up; jump it you sons of bitches." There were some fellows from Grand Junction (who] came down into the Montezuma Creek area, and they had a scintillator
and they was wanting to find some ore. This Lewis Sleek had leased a mine up in Bradford Canyon, it was an early mining area that they had mined principally for vanadium, a little uranium. I met him on one of his trips down there. He was hauling out some ore and got stuck and had a lot of trouble. So they would come over and stay all night with me. Then they decided to come down there and do a little prospecting in the cane there. I got a jeep and we went over into an area which was Dakota formation, but they had the idea that there might be some ore there. We did find some real good ore count, but it was in the Brushy Basin clay, it wasn't in this Dakota at all. So we went and staked it and our agreement was that Lewis Sleek would get a fourth and
Richard and Calvin Perkins each would have a fourth, and myself a fourth. Richard Perkins accompanied us that day. We staked out a good many claims that this Lewis Sleek thought that he should have had, because
9

 CARL MAHON 2
he had the geiger-counter. We didn't hardly think so, because we were furnishing the jeep and lodging and everything, so we thought we should split just a fourth. So we just offed a bunch of claims and then I was to go ahead and go back and run them in pretty accurate, and when I got back over there I found that he had come with another man and had jumped the claims and he had written his name down twice. He was even trying to hook his partner. He had used his
initials on one and his full name on another. He had used our monument--on the original claims, he had a fourth interest and he used the same cans and everything and had jumped our claims. But he had back-dated them further than we had even claimed them. The funny thing was they had the day that the notices were printed, and they were 20 days before the notices had been printed. They hadn't noticed that in the printing office. So we kind of had a little discussion the next time we saw him and he decided to quit-claim his interests to us on that deal. The fact of the matter, he even decided that it was very improper to jump our claims and he quit- claimed his original interest, which we wouldn't have insisted on if he hadn't have tried to hook us. But
there was this kind of thing going on all the time. 10

 CARL MAHON 2
SS: Well, then did you get any good ore out of there?
CM: We finally did get some ore. It was so new that
everyone was skeptical of it, and when we found this ore in this and Lewis tried to hook us on it, we decided the best thing to do was go buy our own Neckonometer and do our own prospecting. I had a red mule that was real gentle, handy to haul around, so I went to using this mule and going out and riding this clay. I thought of this place that I had seen before when I was helping this herder. So I would just ride along with this counter on the highest gear and a lot of times I would get part of the background, but a lot of the times you would get into these clay beds and you would have to kick it down on to a lower gear to control your background, especially if there was a
little wind. So I was riding around in that area where I had seen the soil, but I couldn't quite remember it. I had had a high background count and I had set it down on a lower gear and I just stopped to look to see about where I had been before and I glanced back at the nickometer and it was clear down or clear pegged on the second gear. I got right off that mule, dropped the bridle and started to walking and I had it on this low gear, and I was still getting a good count on it. Pretty soon before I
11

 CARL MAHON 2
actually got to the ore body this thing pegged itself. I really got excited, I was supposed to have met Richard and Calvin Perkins and they were going to take the neckometer and go someplace for the rest of that day. But when I saw what that did I never noticed what time it was or anything. I got busy and
SS: CM:
SS: CM:
SS: CM:
staked a bunch of claims right then and there.
Yes, yes.
You could see the ore was real ore and just anywhere within two or three hundred feet.
And it was in the Brushy Basin?
It was in the Brushy Basin. As near as I know this was the first ore found in the Brushy Basin formation
in the Montezuma Creek area.
Hum.
I know after we got our claims recorded, the next day was the 24th of July, which was a state holiday and I couldn't record them in the courthouse, so I decided that the best thing to do was to go back and stake out a whole large group of claims, and I did, I went up there and staked 32 claims. They call that "Red Hot claims". Then after we got them staked and everything was legal, then there were--and we let the information out that we had found it--there were lots
of people that came to look because it was something 12

 CARL MAHON 2
new. But before we let the public know it, we had gone to everyplace that we knew of this ore that we found was in the red--there are lots of different colors of this Bushy Basin formation. Of course, we
found it in this red clay and we thought that was where it would be again. So we went all over the whole Montezuma alkali, any place that we knew that the Brushy Basin formation was exposed before we let this information out.
SS: What year was this?
CM: This was in 1954, and it was in July, the 23rd. I
found this first ore--well, we had found a little count over in Alkali, but it was just a prospect at that time. Later on we went back and dug out some ore and it shipped a little, it went around 15 or 20 hundredths, but the thing of it was, when they mined it they used a loader, and this particular ore had to be handled real careful, it is either ore or it isn't ore. The ore that we found was real good, was surottengurlite and there was also ottenite there which would run maybe 5 or 8 hundredths, so if it was real--oh, you just couldn't tell for sure what you were getting into or which was [what], and to start with we didn't know. We had run into some of this lemon yellow--it was florescent, it was a yellow, but
13

 CARL MAHON 2
it would look like a florescent lemon-green when you put it under a black light. So we come up with some off-series there before we actually got well acquainted with this kind of ore. Some of this other ore that we found would maybe count 25 or 30 hundredths but would run 50 or 60 hundredths if it was far out of equilibrium under as the ottinite was out of equilibrium over. So we had to learn a lot about it. But I told Melvin Dalton about finding this ore in the Brushy Basin and he had gone down there and he rode for about three days looking in all these places because he thought after he'd seen it in the red that it would be in the red. He came to my place, and there had been some fellows down from up in Colorado and they had asked me to guide them around
in Ute Mountain; they thought there could be possibly some big uranium deposits around Ute Mountain. They had come down and they hired me to take them around and show them around the Ute Mountain area. We were east of the Hatch Trading Post and we found a place that had real good count; we didn't go over to it, but we stopped in a few places and tried it with their simulator, and up about two and one half miles east of Batch's Store we found some real high count, but we had a real bad wind that day. So I took them
14

 CARL MAHON 2
on around on to the Ute Mountain area and we came back that night. We didn't find anything. They were going to check with the tribe about the permits, etc.--but Melvin came in just the next day or something 1ike that and he asked me where I hadn't staked. I told Melvin of this area east of Hatch's store, and he was to give me an interest in his claims if he found anything. So he went down there prospecting and he found the area on the school
section that--the school section is 1639 south, range 25 east--that laid in east of Hatch's, but it was leased by Homestakers. Then following this he found the Peate Claims which eventually produced over a million dollars worth of ore. Well, the way Melvin got out of his agreement with me was that his partner found them and he didn't. At that time I didn't realize that he was responsible, his agreement with me was as responsible as if I had made it with his partner. So my agreement was that I was to get 5% override of anything he found. So again I kind of lost out on that deal. So we went up and built a road up to this Red Hot claims and we shipped some ore there. The first shipment we just took a wheelbarrow and truck, we backed the truck up and just put planks up. The first shipment of ore that we shipped ran 58
15

 CARL MAHON 2
hundredths, we just hand dug it. There were some buckskin colored ores and some red and there would be
flecks of yellow there just as thick as a thumbnail or a match carton something like that, just laying right in the red clay. There was one big red clay ball there that was about as big as a washtub and it just looked like it had rolled in the clay and it still kind of held together, and I took the corner of the blade of the Cat and started to roll it out of the road, because I thought it would be just dead, and when I hit it with the Cat why it just popped open and it looked like you had just taken a gallon of yellow paint and just dumped right down through it. Then there was a oil company out of Texas that was real interested in these claims and they came up and they offered me $150,000 with a 12 1/2% override for these claims. The Perkins boys turned this offer down; they offered to give us $5,000 apiece that day, there was Richard and Calvin Perkins and I, that's the way we staked the claims. They offered to give us another $10,000 in 30 days and, let's see, they said $25,832 within 60 days, and then the balance would be within six months. They offered a job as mining foreman at $800 a month. This is probably what really stirred up the hornets' nest. Calvin Perkins wanted
16

 CARL MAHON 2
that job and the oil company wanted to give it to me because they figured that I had more experience at working. So they got up a big deal that we were going to form a company and they were going to give us--we had about 1,200 claims that we had staked. In the meanwhile we had just taken and blanketed the
country--and they were going to give us $60,000 worth of their oil stock, they were incorporated for $250,000 in the state of Delaware, they had some producing oil wells in Texas, they had 3 drill rigs, and they were just starting to drill 1800 acres of property that they had just leased. They offered to give us $60,000 worth of their oil stock plus about $100,000 cash and they would guarantee to buy back their oil stock within a year if we wanted to sell it. I wanted to take it right then, But Perkins' held back and I just begged them to take it, because I thought that this oil stock would be more valuable than uranium ore and we still were retaining the 12 1/2% royalty, but they sent me out on the reservation to do some prospecting out there, and when I got back the deal had fallen through. Less than six months later this Rye-Clark and Sinkhole, this was the oil company, sold out 49% for 7 million doilars. Anyhow, later on I came to find out that there had been a
17

 CARL MAHON 2
quit-claim deed from me to Perkins' that I had never seen and we went through 1itigation, started into litigation and I got my interest in the claims back, but by that time why we had mined what ore that was shown on the surface. Things kind of cooled down and eventually we never did get anything out of it.
Hum.
SS: CM:
But Melvin Dalton sold out to Reynolds, I believe it was a Canadian company, and he sold out for $150,000 and an override and he and his partner each got $1000 a month for one year to prospect for them, those
folks.
What were the Peate claims?
Those were the Peate claims. They shipped the first sixteen loads of ore and they were averaging 16 tons to the load. The first sixteen loads that they shipped averaged 40 hundredths.
Oh, I guess they got an agency bonus out of that. Well, I'm quite sure they did. The way they acquired this school section was, they went up to the Homestake and told them that they . were kind of interested in sub-leasing this or leasing part of it and Homestake got the idea that maybe there was some
ore down there and they sent their geologist down there. He looked at the ore and said that it wasn't
SS: CM:
SS: CM:
18

 CARL MAHON 2
any good. Well, Homestake kind of wanted to keep a portion of it, so they divided it up and each one of them took a fourty wide and they divided up in four parties and they said, "Well, we'll keep this one and the middle one and you can have these two." These deposits were on the one that they offered Dalton and Menlove. Homestake tried to bring a suit against them
later and everything, but it never did work out. They had mined this ore with a Ford tractor and a front- end loader. They just went up there and went to shooting it. The ore was 25 feet thick and was averaging this 40 hundredths. Seventy-feet behind this deposit they drilled down behind to see where their ore lead, and they got 3 inches of 38 hundredths. It was just a doll, that was all there was to it. Then Randwich was the Canadian Company, Reynolds had something to do with it, but Randwich was the name of the company. They went in and mined these Peate Claims and took out quite a bit of ore. The agreement they had from the sale, if they ever decided to sell the mine, they would--or if they gave it up, then it would be returned to Menlove and Dalton. They went to two or three ore bodies and never reported it to the company. They didn't have company men working there, they just had the local
19

 CARL MAHON 2
fellows working for them, so they just kind of took them to the cleaners also.
SS: Do you know who, where they shipped that ore, out of the Peate? Who bought it?
CM: The mill in Monticello bought this ore. Now this was a bentonite ore. They just hated it, they couldn't melt it or anything. So, I quit Perkins' when we began to go in litigation and went to Rangely and worked on an oil rig there for a while. I came back in the fall of '56 and went to work at the Happy Jack. But let me see, the spring of 1955 I went back down into the White Canyon area and worked for quite a long time stripping out channels on some property owned by Walt Stevens and Melvin Adams and Fred Haliday, and I guess the Perkins boys had an interest in it of some kind. I worked out there for about three or four weeks in the White Canyon area running this Cat and this chute. They had quite a bit of copper, but we never did run into any uranium ore that was any good.
SS: What did they call that mine?
CM: I can't remember.
SS: Oh, that's all right.
CM: I just can't remember what they did call those
claims, seemed like it was Blue something, something 20

 CARL MAHON 2
to do with clay. But I found mud channeling handier when I was working there, that I dug out and it was mud. It had mudstone and it had lots of trash in it. This channel was about nine feet across and about 12
feet deep and I dug it all out. Several people tried to get Melvin Adams and his partners to go ahead and run a drift back in there or to drill it. Right to this day that channel has never been drilled. It was just above the Happy Jack about five or six miles. I still believe that there might be a time that it is opened up and they will got ore.
SS: Well now, what kind of problems would you run into mining a mud channel like that? Is it in sand or--?
CM: Well, there was a length of sandstone up above it and we could have gone into it. At that time I really didn't know that much about it, but Adams and these fellows after two or three years let their claims go. Now A tlas has them, and I have never to ld them where the channel was. The rainstorms filled this hole that I dug up with muck and they, as far as I know, Atlas doesn't have any idea that this channel is there and nobody has ever drilled it yet but me.
SS: If Atlas should let those claims go or anything like that would you claim them?
CM: I sure would, because after I went to work at the 21

 CARL MAHON 2
Happy Jack and saw how these mud slides roll in and out, there is just a real good chance that this still has some good ore in it. That was in the summer of
1 55, and then I quit that fall for Perkins'. I worked for a local fellow and drilled spar wells. Then along in May of '56 I went to Rangely and worked over there until about the last of July and came back and worked for a short time on the McCracken area when that field was opening. Then Rolly Micksell was the mining foreman for Texas Paint after they bought the Happy Jack, and he asked me to go out and work for them. At that time I had drilled quite a little just ditches or something like that, but I never really had mined as a miner, and help was really hard to get, so I went out to the Happy Jack to go to work in the latter part of September of 1956. They were setting this mine up, putting in new rails and doing a lot of work, putting in electric tremors and things like that, and we didn't actually get to mining until sometime in November. I did a lot of Cat work when I first went out there. They had a new Cat and didn't have anybody to operate it, and I had operated a Cat a lot. The first part of my work there was as a Cat operator. I had to get a partner to help me, and I got Duane Carlton, who married one of Dod Homers'
22

 CARL MAHON 2
daughters; he went out with me and we started working there at the Happy Jack. We were on a contract basis, they paid up to $2.56 per ton, or each ton be bought
out caps and fuse and powder--and they withheld social security and income tax. For the time we were out there, when we first got started, we didn't have many places to work, and they were just getting the mine set up, but we averaged about $775 a month for the full time we were there. Then we were the
furthest back, we were on #2 drift, and we were back about 2,100 feet when we started working. We drove the drift on back to about 2,375 feet plus cutting some big channels in there. We tried to average around 40-50 tons a day.
SS: I've been out to the Happy Jack, but I'm not too sure where the #2 drift is. Was that in the big room area now? Have they pulled those pillars in that area to the east?
CM: They had then and they hadn't run that drift underneath; that was done later on. We were over on the lead plant of the mine, there was a number 3 channel that went out there, but it didn't go near as far to the south and west as the channel we were on. There was one pillar there about 900 feet long and they had a young mine foreman that was just out of
23

 CARL MAHON 2
school, and he was trying to run it. He had his degree but he didn't have experience. He wouldn't give us but two places to work. He had quite a lot of trouble until Ed Swatt came to work there, and after he got there he let us work seven or eight different places. From that time on we really began to make money. Sometimes we would make as high as $1100 a month clear, but there had been a couple of months there when we just about broke even our wages. After we got the larger number of places we made good money
and enjoyed the work. Then Isabelle came in and started stripping this mine, and every morning when we went in to make a shot we would find big old chunks of ore rock had dropped out of the ceiling, and I just decided that that would be a good place to be away from. So I quit. Curly Carlton stayed in and I quit. Roy Montsell and his brother Earl and I went out and leased the Peate claims, and started to work the Peate claims. Earl got his neck hurt and he had a neck injury before. Roy was awful good to keep up the equipment and stuff, but he really didn't produce much ore. So we decided that maybe it would be better to quit, because we made around $400 or $450 a month for the time we were there. Then later, after we divided up and everything, we sold our equipment to
24

 CARL MAHON 2
the Even and Odds, that was what Menlove and Dalton called their company, Even and Odds. I took a job as foreman with a percentage of the profits. My wife was bookkeeper. So we started in and had a few Indians working for us, Joe Bill, Heiope Hot Dog and Howard--
I can't recall that name right now, I'll think of it in a minute. Anyhow, they went to work for me there at the mine, and we began to shipping ore. During the time of the mine that I had it, we had started shipping some ore to Mexican Hat. We could always beat the Monticello assay. We would get 35 hundredths from Monticello, but we would get 38 or 39 from the mill at Mexican Hat. But the thing of it was, Mexican Hat mill was just in the process of getting set up and they found this ore real hard to refine and it kept balling up this mentonite type ore. Also, we had a terrible time drilling, we just couldn't drill it wet. We would sop up the floor and it would stick to you a bit. A lot of times you could see it and it would collar up and you couldn't get your bit back. So, I got a suction pan, we drilled a hole and we got a suction pan set up on top. We kept the air right up close to the face and I wore a mask, I did the drilling, and I wore a mask and drilled dry. I was in
there one day drilling when the mine inspector caught 25

 CARL MAHON 2
me, which I really wasn't prepared for. He asked me why I was drilling dry and I told him. He took some
cuttings and sent them in and they said that this clay wouldn't cause any damage to the lungs. We had to buy a permit which cost us a dollar, to go ahead and mine dry. While the mine inspector was there we run into some peacock copper. It was just a 1ittle knob about the size of the eraser on a lead pencil and it just glistened like rubies. This man was just sure that I had run into a ruby mine and he got so excited and everything, he wanted me to send out samples and all. I told him all the time that it was peacock copper, but he wouldn't believe me. He had never seen anything like it before. It was just beautiful, just a whole face, a six foot face, and probably there would be fifteen or twenty of these per square foot, of these little nodules of peacock copper. He had to take some and have them tested before he would believe me. I thought that was quite amusing. But I mined this myself on this basis from September to July or the last of June of 1 58. They shut us down because on production they couldn't handle the ore. The mill in Monticello, they quit buying and the Mexican Hat mill was having a terrible time handling this ore. So I quite goofing off and
26

 CARL MAHON 2
went to work for Mason mining. That was Calvin Black and Ion Ferril and Russ Black. I went out and worked
for about a month on the Capitol Food Board property by old the jail and then they got into a litigation. They had a bum lease from somebody, I don't know why, and so they closed this mine down and I went up and went to work for an iron mining company which had
leased the Sandy Mines. I can't remember the name of that company now, but they were from McDonald, Michigan.
SS: Now the Sandy is on the reservation, isn't it?
CM: No, the Sandy is up on Elk Mountain close to the Hideout. While I had been working in the Peate Mines
and in the Catro-Phebo Mines, on holiday maintenance, just west of Holgio I had just all Navajos and I was trying to learn the language. I used as many Navajos as I could, and as long as I could say it in Navajo I never would use English. When I went up to work for this Michigan company, they had some Finns and different people who talked broken English. I was at the mine, I was hired as a mine forernan there and while I was working there one of these fellows came over and he talked real broken, and I answered him. I was preparing a hammer or whatever I was doing and he just stood there and he stopped me and I realized
27

 CARL MAHON 2
that I had answered him in Navajo. So I had to back off and tell him in English what he had asked. But this was the first Navajo, or help was real hard to get then and they wanted me to hire some miners, but they were against using Navajo Indians. I finally talked them into it and I hired Dan Black from over
in Monument Valley and Herbert Johnson from here in Blanding. This Herbert Johnson was a real good driller. Clarence Tipke had held a drilling record with the iron company for 16 years. It just happened one day that I had to put them on the same face of ore, and this Herbert Johnson out-drilled Tipke. The company really liked the Navajo boys that I hired there. This Dan Black later on got killed in a car wreck, and this one fellow offered to set up a school fund for his children. They were really well pleased with his work.
SS: Well, you must have found the Navajos good miners.
CM: I found them excellent miners, they were better in the Peate. There were days when I had to be gone and they would be able to see the ore. The ore there was
a primary type ore and you could hardly tell it. These Indians were actually better judges of the ore than was anybody else. I did the drilling all the time there, that's the reason I worked there, and
28

 CARL MAHON 2
this--we would have to poke each hole, because lots of times we couldn't tell what was ore and what was waste. We poked each hole, and in this one room we had a face of ore that was about 22 feet wide and 10
feet high. I would go in there and drill and shoot this and I would keep the miners busy, two shifts of miners busy for about four days. These Indians could easily, easily hand muck, hand cart and put out about an average of 16 tons a day per man. This ore in the bentonite clay was a real light ore and they--oh, it probably was a third lighter than the average ore. It took a lot bigger truck to haul it than a lot of them had. They could haul the heavier Morrison ore or the Shinarump ore, but when they come out there they just couldn't get a load off. Most of them had to put up side-boards, extra side-boards to haul it. Our mine car wouldn't haul but about 2,500 pounds or a ton and a quarter, and these Indians had about 900 feet--and that was the biggest car we could get in. But they, some days, one day I know I had another Indian working there and I would let him take the pick-up and go to town after parts and one thing and another, and they thought that I was kind of being extra good to him and not to them. He went off and got drunk and I canned him, and they had been kind of aggravated
29

 CARL MAHON 2
and hadn't been putting out much ore, and I let them set a couple of days before I said anything, but they still all held up. So I went in there one morning and said if they didn't go to work I was going to can them too. So they didn't do hardly anything that day, I think about 12 pounds, and I thought, "Well, I'11 give them one more day and then if they don't go to work then I'm going to can them." The next day they put out about 39 tons, two of them in an eight hour
shift. From that day on you could just about bet that it would be from about 39-4O tons. I had one old Indian that wanted a job, needed a job, he had a large family. Sam Cowboy was his name, he was in his early forties and he never did use anything but a wagon. He didn't understand much English, and I couldn't talk that much Navajo, but I took him and put him on a shovel car and I kept checking on him, and within a week he began to take this shovel car out and dump it. He was a small man, and he easily got out from 15 to 18 tons in an 8-hour shift by himself; he didn't like to work with anybody else. So I found the Navajos to be very good miners and very conscientious.
SS: Out at the Peate and later up on Elk Mountain, when you hired Navajos, did they like to bring their
30

 CARL MAHON 2
families with them?
CM: They did, and that was one thing that I let them do. Now at the Peate it's right along by the reservation and they just went home each evening. But the Capital Feed Board Mine, which was on the reservation, this Dan Black couldn't commute; it was too far from his home. So he moved his family there and the other miner lived a couple of miles away. Now when I went to the Sandy they furnished them a trailer house and they let them bring their families, and this proved to be a lot more satisfactory. Another thing, and this was something that I really appreciated, was that we didn't have guards there at the Peate mines, and we thought that there might be somebody come in there and steal the equipment or something. These
Indians were back and forth quite a lot on the week- end, and I told these Indians if they saw anybody messing around up there to go and tell them to leave. Roy Colger had worked for Randway when they were there, Roy Colger and Bill Porter. They came over thinking they might find employment and kind of wanting to stay there now that the Peate mine was working again--it was down for about six months before I started operating it, and they wanted to go see what ore had been found and how it looked and
31

 CARL MAHON 2
all. They came over there and they were there at the portal. Joe Bill saw them and he went up and told them that I was in Blanding and if they wanted to see me that they could some over here or come back Monday. They told him that they just wanted to look around. He said, "No, if you want to see Carl, you go
see him." So they both knew me real well, we had been raised together in Colorado, and they knew it would be alright. This Indian didn't realize that although he didn't know them, they talked to them for quite a while, and he just told them, "No," and they thought that he would fight before he would back and give them permission. They said they had never seen an Indian that loyal before.
ss: That is very interesting. One of the girls on the project is interviewing Navajos who have been involved with mining. Maybe when we get through here, if you know where any of these boys are, if you would write down their names maybe she could find them. If you could.
CM: Both these boys are dead now. Joe Bill was killed in a gun accident and Howard Marsh was killed in a mining accident. He went ahead and after he quite working at the Peat mine, or after he quit he went over and worked in the Slickrock area. He worked
32

 CARL MAHON 2
there years and years and finally he was killed in a mining accident. So both of those boys are gone and the--Dan Black was killed in a car wreck at Mexican Hat, a truck ran away, lost its brakes coming down that hill and ran right into that bluff and killed Dan and his uncle and his cousin. Herbert Johnson is working over by Monticello, and I'm sure that you
could interview him. He worked in the big mines
throughout the area.
SS: When you were up at the Sandy and you had the Navajo
crew working for you, was there any difficulty with
the other, with being accepted into the area?
CM: To start with, these people form the east kind of worried, but after they found that they were good workers and reliable they was accepted. There were some Italians, Finns and Norwegians working with the mining company too, people that had come out with them and they were accepted. The families of these men were accepted real well, the ladies, all the
miners had their families with them, or most of them had their families with them, and they hadn't been around the Italians much, and they found them extremely interesting. They treated them real well.
ss: Well, there were quite a number, I mean finally in the late 50's when a lot of these mines in White
33

 CARL MAHON 2
Canyon, Red Canyon and Elk Creek were in operation there were quite a number of people built up out there, weren't there?
CM: Well, there were a lot of people in the area. Fist in '55, in the spring and the summer of '55 when I was running the Cat down there, the Dry King store of Myron Terrese was there and we would go up there after groceries and they had five clerks working there and sometimes you would wait as much as 25-30
minutes [tape blanks out]--miners, lots of them. When I was working the Happy Jack, Ed and R. had around 40 men working there at the sampling plant, which was right below the Happy Jack. Then I forget how many men were employed, about 20 or 25 at the Happy Jack. The Cobb Minerals had their up-grading mill and mine going. They had three shifts of about 100 men a shift. There was one crew coming and going. They had tramp miners, lots of tramp miners, and some of them would just work a shift or two and go off drunk, or go off to another digging. So there were people just coming and going all the time. There were several wanted men picked in that area, because it was a boom area and they would think that they would have a good
chance at getting in there and hiding. SS: Uh-huh.
34

 CARL MAHON 2
CM: Several men came in and went to work for a few days,
then they would grab their check and leave. Some of them didn't even bother to get their check and they didn't leave a forwarding address.
SS: With transients and people that weren't assimilated into the community, did they have many incidences of violence or disputes or this sort of thing?
CM: Well, there were quite a few. I never was around anywhere there were any killings. There were quite a lot of arguments and litigations and threats and one thing and another. But most of them weren't of enough actual value in the property that the--after they cooled off. There was a mining company out close to the Greenwater area, they were talking in Mike's Canyon and in Cattle Wash area, and there was a red- headed woman about 28 or 29 years old, or that's what people thought, that headed the company. They staked over everybody. They just didn't back off unless somebody got after them about it. They might say that you had made a mistake in you survey and we want the fractions. Evidently there was lots and lots of money behind this thing because they had two or three big tents and they really ate good and hired a cook.
This woman would go out on these staking trips and she carried a .45 on her hip all the time. They hired
35

 CARL MAHON 2
a lot of college boys. A good many times when those college boys would take a hike throughout the country with her the next day they just couldn't get out of bed. She would just damn near kill them. There was one fellow there for about sixty days laid up in the rocks. He put a sign on his claim he didn't want anybody staking over them or anything, he wanted to sell them and get out of the area, or get money and get out. He put a sign up on his claims all around on the exterior boundary and he said if a certain red- headed woman jumps these claims, "Why, I'm going to kill her," and he laid up in the rocks with his marks fixed from daylight till dark every day there for sixty days. That was one of those claims that you couldn't touch.
SS: Was she a speculator, or did she figure that she could get any value out of those claims?
CM: Well, no, I don't know. She evidently was working for some big company. I never did know of anybody who knew exactly who was putting up the money, they just spent money like water. They had fifteen or twenty people working, cooks, good equipment, everything.
She was boss.
ss: Do you remember what her name was?
CM: I don't know what her name was, maybe some of the
36

 CARL MAHON 2
other fellows, I never saw her but a time or two. Maybe some of the other fellows around the area will remember her name. Now Junior Coffee and Holiday, Howard Holiday staked a lot of claims out in that area, and this one young Holiday, I forget his name, was out there with them. He was riding a big old brown mule and that mule threw him off every day for
30 days. He said that he always was glad when the mule threw him off in the morning because he didn't have to ride all day waiting for him to do it. He was telling me that one night he was coming in and he got within 50 yards of the camp and he thought that he had made it, but the mule threw him off before he could get off.
SS: Well, I understand from what you were saying that they hauled a truckload of beer cans off every morning. I understand that people down there had some pretty big parties.
CM: Well, that's right. They played, gambled a lot, their beer or pool and things 1ike that. It just wasn't uncommon to see $100.00 on the table, and sometimes as much as a thousand dollars, a thousand dollars on the table on just one pool game. Some of the--well, most of the places were open 24 hours a day.
SS: At Fry?
37

 CARL MAHON 2
CM: At Fry. There were--at that time when I was there in
'55 there were office clerks plus the postmistress working.
SS: Did you ever get down into the little community there at the river at White Canyon? They had a--or maybe that had been moved.
CM: No. I was there during the time that that was operating. First the vanadium copper mill was set up at Pike, and that's where the first ore was shipped out of the Happy Jack. I was neighbors with Joe Cooper and my wife had grown up with Brunson's daughters. They had tried to get me to go down and work for them. They had bought this mine, which you probably have a history of already, then they couldn't ship the ore. They had shipped--well, I was out there when they sent word back and said they couldn't buy anymore of the ore because the radioactive ore was ruining their mill. So there they sat, and this more or less kind of got under Brunson's skin, thinking that he had spent $250.00 for a mine that he couldn't sell the ore out of. I was down there on different occasions when they were milling the ore and saw the operation working. I heard Joe and Phillips talk about it.

CONDUCTED ON
UTAH FOR THE UTAH URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT . TAPE # 1 . ]
CONTINUA TION OF AN INTER VIEW WITH CARL MAHON AUGUST 9 , 1 9 7 0 BY SUZANNE SIMON AT BLANDING,
CM: It was quite interesting, this Fletch Bronson had already sold the Happy Jack mine, and we had a neucleorneter and he came and borrowed it. It cost about $500 at that time, he came and borrowed it to go and do some prospecting. He was welcome to it, but
it was kind of unusual, a multi-millionaire corning to
borrow his neighbor's nucleorneter.
SS: What's the difference in a nucleometer and a geiger
counter?
CM: Well, they are just more sensitive. I believe ours
had 24 tubes in it, and they were real sensitive and you could fly with them. Now this Red Hot claim that we had down in Montezuma, they were doing lots of flying, they were hunting this ore. They would come over every day, they used to go down to the Monument #2 mine on the reservation to check out their instruments to see if they was working properly. After they found out about the Red Hot they would come and check out over there, and there were lots of times they would get 15-20 times what they would come over to the Red-Hot claims to check their instruments to be sure that it was still working all right. I had quite an amusing experience with--right after I found
39

 CARL MAHON #1
the Red-Hot claims. Joe Fury from over in Dove Creek had staked some claims and leased some property from Perkins' and he was drilling on the Westwater section of the march on some little trees and one thing and another. It was just strictly prospecting, he didn't have anything to go on, just hope mostly. So anyhow, he had a little old counter that you had earphones on. It wasn't a dial or anything, you just counted the ticks. He was down there shooting back in there, he and his son and somebody else, I can't remember who it was at that time. I had been up at the Red Hot and found ore and I picked up some rusty looking rock and I handed it to him and asked him to test it to
see if there was any ore in it. So he did, he tested it. "Well," he said, "there might be just a little bit, not much." I had this ore in my pocket and I knew it was just really hot, and when I put the tube down by my pocket he just reached up and said "My God, where did you get that hot rock?" But he had a school section up in the bug park area and he had found some dinosaur bones and trees there and they assayed around 2%, but they were just small logs. He got a map from the A.E.C. that hadn't been released yet--he had a friend working there or something--and he got one that was a couple of weeks before it was
40

 CARL MAHON #1
to be released, and he brought it down and he showed it to me and he wanted to know if there were any of those hot spots on his claims. He didn't think that
it would be well to be quiet and stake these hot spots, they had all the hot spots marked, and he never thought of that. It was really amusing. He just wanted to know if there were any of those hot spots on his school section.
SS: Oh yes.
CM: So, I looked the m~p over real well, I knew the
country and I looked his map over real good, and went up and staked all the hot spots. Most of them I had already staked.
SS: You didn't think it would hurt, huh?
CM: But he didn't realize that he had that information
right there, and I had already found the Red Hot claims and showed him some of the ore and I told him about it, but for some reason he wasn't interested in it.
SS: Hum.
CM: I gave him a couple of days, and when I thought that
he wasn't going to stake them, I beat it right up
there and staked them.
SS: Well, did you mine out those areas up there, the Hot
Spots?
41

 CARL MAHON # 1
CM: We never did. Up on the claims they still are like
SS: CM:
SS: CM: SS: CM:
the day when I found them. It could be there is some radon gas in that country. This Montezuma Brushy ore is bad for radon gas. But we drilled a few holes on the Red Hot and then there was another company that drilled just below a ways north of us on some hot spots that they found. There are still probably about 7 or 8 sections in there that have never been drilled and these hot spots are still on them. I would have probably gone back later on and tried to do something with these, but I went to work for the government and
I can't mess with that kind of stuff now, with my job. But I still know where they are.
Do you still hold the claims?
No, I gave them up after I went to work for the government. They kind of frown on it, so I gave them up.
Even though you had staked them before?
Yes.
Hum.
So I gave them up, but over by the Red Hot, I know
where--they have been staked since--but I still know where there are some hot spots, and I believe that eventually that will be drilled out and some good ore will be found there.
42

 CARL MAHON #1
SS: Uh-hum.
CM: I just don't believe that that's all the ore in that
area.
SS: Did any of the mills develop a process that was
amenable to that clay?
CM: They did, Mexican Hat mill finally got a slurry set-
up going and they actually encouraged people to bring that type of ore in. They needed it, and if they couldn't produce enough ore they would go out and haul in clay to help with in their slurry process. Nowadays it's easily handled. But at that time it sure didn't fit, it would ball up, and they sure hated to see that ore coming.
ss: I think the last mine we talked about where you worked was the Sandy.
CM: Well, they closed it down. We did a lot of long- holding and tore out a bunch of pillars and one thing and another and they decided what little ore was left in there just wasn't good enough for their operations, so they closed it down. After they closed it down I quit mining and I haven't been engaged in mining since. We did find some interesting things are in the Sandy. There were a lot of big mud balls in there, and these are caused by a bank caving off along the river, and then the water would be swift it
43

 CARL MAHON # 1
would start rolling. The mud, it's something like a bentonite type clay, and it wasn't very easy to
saturate with water. The outside would become saturated and the force of the water would keep turning it. Pretty soon it would be a complete mud ball. Some of these mud balls that we found in that Sandy mine were 15 and 2O feet through. This one pillar that they left in there, I went in there when I went to work. They just had steel all over in this pillar. What had happened was this mud ball was in the center of this pillar, and they, the Shinarump ore was real hard and they would have a lot of pressure on the jack plate, and when they went into this clay, it was a soft clay and it just rammed about 3-5 inches right into this clay and it would collar up and they couldn't get it out. So I was thinking about it one day, there was a lot of new steel, and this North Range Mining Company from McDowney that had a lease on it, they were used to doing things in a big way, and they spent lots of money in big costs like the smaller miners around the area, and this is one reason that they couldn't operate after they got a small volume of ore. So they had asked me to cut costs as much as I could and still keep the operation going. I noticed a little
44

 CARL MAHON # 1
drip of water that was coming down from the ceiling and it was dripping down and hitting one of these steels and running down and following the steel down
into the hole and it had finally wet the clay up around the steel. I went and got a pipe wrench and turned the steel two or three times and pulled it right out. So each morning after I got the miners lined up I would go and get two or three buckets of water and pour a can of water on each steel and let it run down, and I think that I got 36 steel out of this, six foot steel, out of this pillar. A lot of them were brand new steel, just drilled two or three feet into this pillar. It just looked like a porcupine. I had enough steel that I didn't have to buy any new steel, I just collected around, these miners would get stuck and just wouldn't take the time to pull them out. This Sandy mine had some awfully high grade ore in it. They shipped a lot of waste or real low grade; they had ore in there that would go for 40%. We found several places that it would go for 20%. The highest our counter would only go to was 20%, and we had ore that would peg it so quick you had to watch it or it would bend the needle.
ss: For goodness sake!
45

 CARL MAHON # 1
CM: They just had small, as near as I could tell, from 3
1/2 to 4 feet thick that they would have this real high grade blend of ore. In lots of places they were pulling 20 feet of ore in this mine. This particular channel had about 12 or 15 feet of mudstone between the Moenkopi and the ore strata, which is real unusual.
ss: Well, does that give you a lot of problems with mining it?
CM: Well, no, not bad. We knew this, and it was a little hard to drill the lefters, because if you weren't careful you would run down clay and this would--it would stick to your steel. But as soon as the miners
found out about it there wasn't any problem.
SS: So you ran your channel right above that clay layer? CM: Yes, we would run it right above the clay. We ran
into another interesting, found another interesting thing in the Happy Jack when we were mining it. In places there would be six or eight inches of mud laying right on the Moenkopi, and when you hit that mud you would just back-off, pull-out. Most of the mines where the ore set right on the Moenkopi, you would drill down until you started getting your red cuttings back. Then there was this grey clay coming in, so whenever you started getting grey you would
46

 CARL MAHON # 1
pull your steel back out. Going up into #3 drift there was a real steep climb up out of there, maybe about 14% and you couldn't get up there for lack of
tremors, so it went up real steep for about 100 feet and then leveled off. Ed Swap had told the Art brothers to drill down and shoot this out at a better angle so that we could get up there. They started drilling, and Bunson and Cooper, when they had mined it, they had followed this clay beam up. Well, they started drilling and as soon as they started drilling they went into another ore body, or they thought it was ore, they were right in the sand. So they set out and got a counter and brought it in there and they tested it and sure enough it just started at a thin layer on the Moenkopi and by the time they got to the back of it they had 11 feet of ore there that Brunson had gone right over--
SS: Had gone over--
CM: So after that we were real careful to be sure that we
were going right to the Moenkopi.
SS: Well, now is that a pod in the floor that was similar
to the one that they found recently out there?
CM: No. What it was, there had been a deposit of ore made there in the channel. Then there had been a thin layer of clay--probably a big storm had brought down
47

 CARL MAHON #1
the clay from the Chinle formation and it was just coated down over this sandstone. Then there was another deposit of sandstone on top of that and sandstone ore. They had hit this clay; it had occurred for quite a long distance along between the Moenkopi and the Shinarump, this about six inches of grey clay. So when the clay started up they just
followed it up and just never did know anything about it. If it hadn't been so steep to get their trimmers up then they might have never found it.
SS: --never found it.
CM: But it wasn't a whirlpool or a pod in the floor or
such as Ed Nelson, John Black and Evan Hurst found. There were a lot of tricks there and a person had to be on their toes.
SS: When you were going back in there as you said you did when you were mining it, was it good ventilation back in there?
CM: Well, for a time there wasn't. I got pretty sick back in there one day. I was back in there and they didn't have the air channeled properly and I didn't get enough air and I got pretty sick that one day. But after that they got their cross-cuts and after that
we did have good ventilation.
SS: Were you using diesel equipment?
48

 CARL MAHON # 1
CM: No, we were using electric tremors and we didn't have
any diesel equipment under the ground at all when I
worked there.
SS: Which do you like better?
CM: Well, the electric is a lot nicer, that diesel smoke
gets pretty bad. Now we had some bad air up at the Sandy mine. We were using Aruko loaders, but that Aruko broke down sometimes, and we had an Allis- Chalmers locater in there, it had a good scrubber on it. Then we were using all diesel shuttle cars. The smoke would get pretty bad in there and we would use our fans and everything and still our air would get pretty bad. The air got so bad that it seemed like about 3 1/2 or 4 hours a night was all we could sleep.
SS: Uh-hum.
CM: You just couldn't sleep. I guess we just weren't
getting enough oxygen or something like that. In the morning when we went in, the drifts were at that time, were over--it was over 4 1/4 miles, it seems like it was over 1,900 feet straight drift. In the morning when you went back in you could stand at the back of the drift and look out and see the trees on the other side of the canyon. By noon you could hardly see more than light coming in the porte. Those
49

 CARL MAHON #1
were some of the conditions that weren't too good back then, at that time.
ss: Let's see. Well, you started out interested in horses and ranching and cattle and so forth; have you ever returned to that interest at all?
CM: Well, yes, after I quit the mining business I went into the road construction for a time and then in the fall of 1959 I went to work for the Bureau of Land Management as a range technician and I have worked for them since. My work is mainly around the cattle and sheep operations, planning type work for range development, reservoirs, springs. Then also I work a lot with wildlife. I do a lot of work with bighorn sheep in this area. I find this work is a lot more interesting to me. I had a chance a time or two to go back to the mines, and although I could make more
money, I didn't want to do it.
SS: What area are you concerned with, can you describe it
to me?
CM: Well, when I went to work for the Bureau there were
only 7 people working in the Monticello office, and this office had all the Grand and San Juan Counties. I worked these from about '65-'66. I worked both of these counties counting livestock and checking on trespass, and then they divided up into units or
50

 CARL MAHON # 1
areas, they call it. Now my area comes up Dark Canyon to the forest line, follows the forest line around Elk Mountain and around the Blue Mountains and back around to Monticello. Then it follows the highway to
the state line, down the state line to the Indian reservation, and then down the Indian reservation to the mouth of Montezuma and down the San Juan River to the confluence of the San Juan and Colorado, up the east shore of Lake Powell to the mouth of Dark Canyon.
SS: That is still quite a good-sized area, isn't it?
CM: About a m illion and one-half acres.
SS: Well, are you involved in the movement of the
livestock--of the people that use that for pasturage, do you have to be responsible for, to see that they get in when they are supposed to and out when they are supposed to and this sort of thing?
CM: Well, yes. We try to work with the ranchers as close as we can, and most of the ranchers will work real well with us. Sometimes they will miss a few cattle, and if we see a cow that they missed or a few head that they missed we tell them about it, and if they don't go and get them then we have to press trespass charges. But for the most of them they're real good, and it's just an oversight, that something gets out
51

 CARL MAHON #1
or something like this, and if it's a real late, wet spring a lot of times we give them some extension time in the spring. [tape disturbanceJ--but when I first came to the country, I became interested in the bighorn sheep and then I, after I went to work for the B.L.M. I kept up on these interests and kept records. Then as the president of the Blanding Sportsmen we brought pressure to bear on Fish and Game to get some graduate students down to study them. Now if you are interested in--
ss: I'd love to hear about this, so just rave on.
CM: You're all ready?
ss: Yeah, I'm all ready.
CM: Well, as I was saying, when I went out with Muckman
in 1942 I became interested in these bighorn sheep; I had never seen them but we saw tracks. With that many people along why we scared the sheep off before we ever got close to them. Then while I worked out at the Happy Jack mine and different times when I had occasion to go out there, I was always looking for them, but I was never able to see them. Other people saw them, but it seems that they always evaded me. So this really became quite a point with me, I wanted to see them. I went to work for the B.L.M. in 1959 and just a few days after I went to work, some of the
52

 CARL MAHON #1
boys came in and were telling me about seeing these sheep. They also had a lot of them [that] had seen them while I was working there at the Happy Jack, some of them right up on top there. I would go out and look and I could just--never was where the sheep were. I couldn't see them; I couldn't have been
lower. But in the spring of 1960 or the late spring we were flying, checking trespassing in the outside dome area, and we saw four rams from the air. This was real encouraging to me. I began to talk to the local game wardens and I talked to a lot of people already, trying to get them to do something about it, and they wouldn't. I guess it was 1961 the Board of Big Game Control came across the river and they had a luncheon for them up on the mountain. The district manager, Keith Norris and his wife and my wife and I met this group up there and we ate lunch. There had been a bunch of these bighorn sheep that crossed the road right in front of them down by Fry. I again tried to get them to become interested in them. They
just didn't seem like they cared. Well, I began to go out in that area a lot. I think some of the first times that I saw sheep were with Irvin Oliver and his father Harrison Oliver, they were cowboys on the T.Y. division of the Indian Creek Cattle Company. Also
53

 CARL MAHON # 1
Greg Stevens, another cowboy that worked for them. We saw these sheep. I make numerous trips out into this area and would look for sheep all the time. I
recorded the sheep, the varieties and where they were, and I would send a copy of my reports to the State Fish and Game. '11hey wasn't used to Federal people that would get out and walk, and I kept telling them about the areas I was seeing. Robby John was the first one to convince the state office that I actually did this walking. My son was with me quite a little, Curtis was only six or seven years old when he started going with me out into this area. We just kept gathering data on it and the Blanding Sportsmen Club set-up a form. We took this around to anybody that we heard of that saw sheep, and asked them to fill it out as near as they could, as we kept that on record. We kept pestering Utah Fish and Game to get a study on them or have a season on them so that we could find out something about them. They were real reluctant to do anything. We were members of the Southeastern W ildlife Federation and we got to talking to them about the bighorn sheep. They went after the Fish and Game and that didn't come to bring any great results, so we got the State Wildlife Federation to help us. I kept sending in these
54

 CARL MAHON # 1
reports all the time, and I would document them, where I saw them and the time and the sex and all about it. We kept putting this data down and then we got Mel Call, the state BLM biologist down. He went with us and we got to see more sheep. So he helped us. In the meantime, I was elected president of the
Blanding Sportsmen Club, so I put lots of pressure to bear there, but when the vote came up to make a recommendation of anything I didn't vote, the Board of Directors did the vote and I only voted in case of a tie. So actually I encouraged them, but it was the directors that made the decisions. Finally they told us that the first graduate student coming to Utah State would be sent down here, the first one that they felt was qualified. So in early 1965 they told us that they had found a student, and they sent Lanney Wilson, a graduate from--he had his B.A. from Wyoming State, and came over to do his graduate work in Logan. So they set up a cooperative study with the cooperative wildlife research out of Logan and the Fish and Game and BLM. The Sports, Fish and Wildlife sponsored this study, and Lanney was here for two years. I knew the area quite well, Rudy Barkneack, Robby John and I took him on his first trip and then I was down there on numerous occasions. Lanney was an
55

 CARL MAHON #1
exceptionally hard worker and he would lots of times jump to conclusions, but he would work just as hard to prove himself right as to prove himself wrong. We had lots of friendly arguments over the deal, and he went back to school the last of September of '65 and
returned in March, the first of March in '66, and he worked until the last of November that year on his studies. He really did work hard and got lots of information. During this time, Dr. Lowe from the Cooperative Research in Logan, and a lot of the different people that were interested int the study came down and we took them on different trips. But when Lanney came they told him that he might find six or maybe a dozen, but he would never find enough sheep to study. The first day that we took him out we showed him three big, nice--oh, we showed him about three big rams, big ones, . and two 1i ttle ones, so there were almost as many as they told him he would see without any ewes. He did a real conservative census and he came up with between 160 and 200 in his study area, which was from the south rim of Red Canyon to the south rim of Dark Canyon. There was one time that we got a project set up and we went over and checked the Gypsum Canyon and Bobby Canyon and Dark Canyon areas. We were over there for ten days,
56

 CARL MAHON # 1
came over and checked Mark's Mesa and some of that area close to the San Juan River. While we were in the Dark Canyon area, between the Dark Canyon and Gypsum Canyon areas we sighted fresh signs 29 times
and saw five bunches of sheep. One thing that we had to use as fresh signs was a lot of times the cliffs along the mesa edge would be six or seven hundred feet high and they were so perpendicular that you couldn't get right out on the edge and look straight down. There were lots of times we would drop rocks off. We would see signs, it had rained recently and we could see tracks with our glasses along the tail of the slope at the bottom of the ledge. We couldn't
see the sheep, but we would drop rocks over and scare them and make them run and we could see the dust. We still couldn't get out far enough to see them, but we could hear them running. So we established the fact that there were sheep in that area. Well, after Lanney finished his study the Cooperative Wildlife Research sent Chuck Urbine down to do a study. Lanney Wilson had Mel Call as his steady advisor, and when Chuck Urbine came down they asked me to be his steady advisor. Chuck was an excellent photographer, where Lanney hadn't taken up this hobby at that time, and some of the best wildlife or bighorn sheep pictures
57

 CARL MAHON # 1
that are in existence today are ones that Chuck Urbine took. Also, we determined that there were enough sheep that it looked like it was possible that we could have a hunt. So they set up a hunt. The first hunt in '67 offered ten permits, and this was a once in a lifetime hunt, and they set the hunt up in the ruough. They sold ten permits, they were drawn, they just took the applicants or their forms and dropped them into a basket and drew them. One fellow had a death in the family and wasn't able to come, but these sheep hadn't been hunted much, except maybe by a few Indians, and they were stupid over that
rough and there were nine killed out of the nine
hunters that came. SS: Hum.
CM: But it did give us some blood samples, long bone samples, and a lot of good information, stomach samples were taken. The next year the hunt was stepped up for the last week in September through the first two weeks in October. I took annual leave and
bought a guide license and I guided all three successful hunters with the difference of 100% and 30% there in two years. Then last year there were six sheep killed out of ten hunters and I guided two of the successful hunters. We didn't know anything about
58

 CARL MAHON #1
the bighorn sheep when we started this study. The more we study them the more there is to know. We find that there is probably a calcium-phosphorous deficiency among these animals which could account
for about 60% of the loss of lambs that we could be gaining. We are conducting further studies all the time. We are now in the process of setting up traps, where we can trap and tag these animals. We have never been able to trap them. During Chuck's study we tried to use some tranquillizer guns and collect some of these sheep, some of these rams, to get some blood samples and also to do some tagging. The vet was only able to come down a couple of times, and that was just for a day or two at a time, and then he went to Alaska on a trip up there and was killed in a plane accident. So that left them without a veterinarian to do this kind of work. They didn't dare to do it. We
started in the fall of '65 putting out hay, and everybody felt this was foolish and sheep wouldn't eat it. But the sheep did eat it, and we have kept up this practice right up to date. Now we are planning to set up some traps, and we hope to be able to trap a bunch of these animals and get some ideas on migration and so on and so forth. Now they divided the hunting area into two units, from White Canyon
59

 CARL MAHON #1
north to the rim of Dark Canyon. From White Canyon south to the rim of Red Canyon, and there were five sheep out of each unit. All the sheep that have been killed on the north side of White Canyon have ear scabies. A lot of times this is something like a mite, a little red fellow that you put under the microscope and is pretty ugly and he gets right in under the skin. They just keep eating and [causeJ irritation. Lots of times several of these rams have had the entire ear channel plugged. But we have never found any sign of ear mites on the south side of White Canyon.
SS: So that leads you to think that they have a natural barrier for them.
CM: That's right. I guess that it was in '67 I went to the bighorn sheep council. They have this throughout the southwestern part of the United States and Mexico. They gather each year and all the scientists and sportsmen and interested people are invited to this bighorn sheep council. They go from New Mexico and A rizona, C alifornia, Nevada--and Utah became involved after this study of Lanney's. The council rotates to these different states. I became a member and the council was held in Kingman, Arizona. We put in a bid for the bighorn council to come to Utah, and
60

 CARL MAHON # 1
we didn't do enough politicking and some of the
fellows from California outvoted us. At that time they made two recommendations, one: that the council be held in Nevada the following year and the next that Utah would have it. So we were lucky enough to get the bighorn sheep council in Utah. This past year we went to California. Next year the sheep council will be held in Santa Fe. These councils are really
educational. There are some veterinarian students that have worked a lot with tranquilizers and different kinds of knock-out pills or shots, and then there are just students making reports of their studies. Also laymen making their reports, and I gave a paper on the mineral consistency of wildlife or domestic animals and wildlife within the southeastern part of Utah and water development. It is really an educational meeting. They have a few days of meetings, one evening session of business, and a field trip. When they were here we had the biggest field trip that they had ever had. We had 66 people come out for the field trip and we fed them a steak supper. There were two of them [that] left, that went home, but we had 66 of them that went out in these different areas. We found that water was probably a limiting factor to the sheep, and the B.L.M. office
61

 CARL MAHON # 1
here in Monticello and the Fish and Game have got together on a cooperative water development, and they have developed certain springs. Now a lot of these
springs had water in them year-round, but during the hot summer months when then ewes were lactating the springs would dry up during the day, the water would run out and down through this course clay. Water comes out of the bottom of the wind gauge and goes down into this porous clay and is absorbed there. Also the sun evaporates a lot of it. A lot of these times the sheep wouldn't have water from early in the morning until late in the evening. When it began to
cool off, then the water would begin to come to the surface. A lot of times there were very small holes. We put out these springs, some of them they haven't found yet, but for the main part they are used. Also in the wintertime, on a really dry winter like we have just had, there isn't any available water, and these springs previously froze up. The water would just seep to the surface and would freeze. Now that we have had these developments the water runs into the roughs and we found that they use the springs
real heavily. Last winter we [began] slowly, but surely, doing something for these bighorn sheep. We are learning some of the things that we would like to
62

 CARL MAHON #1
know, but we've still got a lot to find out.
SS: That is very interesting. Let me ask you, when you go out to observe or to hunt the sheep? How do you get around? Can you get around with a four wheel drive, do you ride horses, or do you have to walk? I guess
it depends on how far back in do you get.
CM: We, lots of times, use all three methods. The rams use the Wingate Mesa which lays between White Canyon and Red Canyon. On the east end of this mesa it is about 7,000 feet. On the lower end it's about 5,500 feet in elevation. In places it isn't over a few yards wide, and in one place it is seven miles wide. These rams run in bachelor groups for about ten months of the year. The rutt season usually starts around the 25th of October or when the rams begin to move down with the ewes. They will lots of times stay with them until the middle of December or maybe the
first of January and then they go back. The ram lambs sometimes will be seen with their mothers or with a group of ewes up until they are two and a half years old. But a lot of time during their [first] two years they are trying to decide whether they are a ram or a
ewe, and so they are back and forth quite a little. At one time I ran into to 17 head of rams in one group. We have seen as many as 20 or 32 ewes and
63

 CARL MAHON # 1
lambs in a group.
SS: Hum.
CM: The ewes usually start lambing the last part of April
and lamb up until the middle of June. We have seen one or two lambs that were born around the first of July. The main part of the lambs are born in the last two weeks in May and the first two weeks in June. They get into real rough terrain and fairly close to water. When these lambs are born they're just a smut color. They can lay down on a rock within 20 or 30 feet of you and unless you see it move, you can hardly see it's there. Then after about three weeks or a month, the white patches begin to show up. After the lambs get to be about three weeks old the ewes begin to move back together. A lot of these ewes are ewes that have run together for years, and there is always th,e old leader, she is the one that leads this. She is gentle, a lot of times we have been up within just a few feet of these sheep.
ss: Is that right?
CM: This Lanney Wilson went over into what we call the
Blue Notch Canyon, it is a tributary to Red Canyon, and he ran into a group of sheep there, and he named this one old ewe Mabel. This was a big dark brown ewe and she had a yearling with her, which could have
64

 CARL MAHON # 1
been one of her lambs, which was real black. There is a great color variation within our sheep here. He called her Schizophrenia because she was always
looking around at all the other sheep, we thought it was because she was dark or something. They were always running and hitting her when she wasn't looking and she was just about a nervous wreck. But he named several of these sheep. Lanney just had to be talking to somebody al1 the time, and he would holler at them and he would just holler at them like they were hard of hearing. They got accustomed to this. He got to where, when he first started
following them--to start with they would run off and leave and he would follow them. Well, they kind of got used to this, but they would always put one of the ewes to watching. She would watch him and see what he doing and where he was while the others grazed. They would take turns. Then later on they got so used to him that they never paid any attention, other than if they went up over a little raise or something, and he didn't come, they would shortly come back to see what was the matter. He worked out a system that when he came into the area he would whistle real load, and they began to recognize this whistle. When he was in the area he would whistle and
65

 CARL MAHON # 1
watch for a little while, and if they were in the this area, pretty soon they would begin looking for him. Then after, I mean when he went to leave, he would again whistle signalling that he was leaving,
and they begin to sense this. When Chuck Urbine came to do his studies I took him over and showed him Mabel and her group and told him if he would walk up to them and talk while he went he could get up real close and get some pictures. Chuck was afraid that he was going to disturb them by speaking loudly, and I was sitting back watching him and he got up [to within] about 150 yards. A sheep doesn't spring when it leaps, like a deer or something, it is just a gathering of the muscles, and then they take off. I could see that Mabel was getting real nervous and I was about a couple or 300 yards [away]. I went to hollering at her just as loud as I could holler, and you could just see her relax when I began to holler.
Chuck got up, and the first time he was out there he got [within] 76 feet of the sheep. There's been a lot of talk about whether sheep actually needed water or not. Now maybe there are places on the desert that they go for long times without water, but they use cactus. In the lower Sonoran Desert they have these barrel cactus which really--and in this first picture
66

 CARL MAHON #1
Chuck took he got pictures of Mabel eating snow. It is the first one recorded wher e t hey were actually
[eating] snow. But he got pictures of that, where he was only 18 or 20 feet form these sheep.
SS: For goodness sake!
CM: They got to where they expected him and he would just
walk right up to them. But for about six weeks there he tried to be with them every day. If there was a specially nice day, why he would take special pictures. If it wasn't he would study their eating habits and resting habits and things like this. Now these sheep always have a noon-day siesta, a noon siesta. Wether it's ten o'clock in the morning or four o'clock in the afternoon, or wether it's ten till four, they would do this, and lots of times he would lay right down with them while they were having this siesta. There are always some of the sheep that are on guard, but he had to come into town for supplies, and there was a boy just from over across the river who came over to see him, and he was gone, of course, so he thought he would run over. So his wife told him where they had been feeding the sheep and he went down there and tried to sneak up on them, on Mabel and her group just flew. He was telling everybody how wild they were, and Chuck had been
67

 CARL MAHON # 1
within 20 feet of them or less.
S S : Hurn.
CM: So a lot of these sheep really got to know us and
knew what to expect. Then there's a lighter group of sheep--
[END OF T APE ONE] [INTERVIEW CONTINUED ON FILE 2MAH159]

 THE FOLLOWING I S THE CONTINUA TION OF AN INTER VIEW WITH CARL MAHON CONDUCTED BY SUZANNE SIMON IN BLANDING, UTAH ON AUGUST 9 , 1 9 7 0 . T H I S INTER VIEW WAS CONDUCTED FOR THE URANIUM INDUSTRY PROJECT. [TAPE #2.]
CM: --they're real light, about like a Palomino horse and without an exception, they're really wild. Some of these sheep, we had got within a mile-and-a-half of them and they would run. I know one time that I got
in real close to them accidentally. I got right in close to them before I realized that they were there. I got into [within] about a hundred and fifty yards of them. They were heavy with lamb and I was scared they were going to injure themselves 'cause they really headed for this ledge. It was so high that they couldn't make it, and they fell. So I got back just as fast as I could and let them out. We noticed this, and the same thing has been noticed by Chuck Hansen over in the Corn Creek area north of Las Vegas, also in Death Valley and also down in Arizona.
SS: Is it just these ones, this color of sheep that has this common characteristic?
CM: Yes. And also this light sheep had the pink tongue where the darker sheep had the black tongue. Chuck Hansen and I are cooperating on a talk next year on our findings on these pink-tongued sheep against these black-tongued sheep. Where they have coughed we find that some of them have spotted-tongues. It isn't
69

 CARL MAHON #2
anything scientific. It's just an interesting point. So we hope to create a little interest and get a few laughs about our study here.
SS: Well, that's remarkable. I never would have imagined that you could have, I would have just thought they were so shy and wild that you could have never found much of anything except tracks.
CM: Well, these sheep are real odd. Smell and hearing isn't very acute to them. You can roll a rock and you can sneak up on them as long as you stay out of sight. There are two ways to approach sheep. you either stay out in view, where they can see you all the time and walk 1ike you are going to just pass them, or you get out of sight and never let them see you. They have excellent eyesight. They claim that it is equivalent to a man with 20/20 vision and 8-power field glasses.
SS: For goodness sakes!
CM: I actually believe this because I've seen sheep and
been watching them through binoculars and only moved a finger and have them become alert. This has been as much as a mile from them. Just move a hand slightly and they pick it up just like that. One of their great habits if something disturbs them or something, they'11 run to a high spot where they can view the
70

 CARL MAHON #2
whole area and they will freeze. A lot of times they will have a rock. They won't be up on the skyline, they'11 be up against a rock at a high spot where they can look. At one time I saw a ram and he saw me
at approximately the same time. He moved a few steps and stood by a cedar tree, watching me. I watched him for 33 minutes. He never moved his tail, he never moved a hair. I had my spotting scope on him and the only thing he moved was the focus of his eyes. Occasionally a car would come down the highway about two miles away. When a car would come you could see him focus his eyes on the car and then back on myself. He played out before I did, and I played out before he did and left. But I timed it with my watch and for 33 minutes he stood absolutely still.
SS: That's really interesting.
CM: The most fascinating animal that I've ever seen. They
can hide and they've got a deer--once you've disturbed them and they know that you are after them, they can make a deer look 1ike an idiot. I 've had them crawl in under ledges lower than this table, back in under it and just barely stick their head out and watch. I've had them stay in there and hide five or six hours. I knew they were there and I had a
hunter with me and we knew they were there and we 71

 CARL MAHON #2
didn't want to disturb them 'cause a lot of times you disturb them and they come out running extremely
fast. We thought if we can just outwait them and let them come out. We knew they were in the area; we could see the whole ground country and they'd never come out. They'd hide in a small cave or something like that. Another thing about sheep, they don't like to have you above them. If you are trying to get up close for pictures or hunting, stay level or below. They like it better if you're below.
SS: That's very interesting.
CM: Any questions that you can think of?
SS: Well, yes, about what's the average life-span of
these sheep?
CM: We feel probably about 12-15 years. Now I found a
real good head and this ram was about 12 years old. Each year that a sheep grows they have a horn-ring. There's a ring on the horn for each year. The first three years with a ram the ring doesn't really amount to much, but each year the horn swells. It is a true horn, but it has holes in the horn. Each year during the---?--- these horns fill with fluid, giving more of a lick in their fighting. Then when the horn goes down it leaves a ring that is 3/8 or 1/2 inch wide and lots of times close to 3 inches deep. Only the
72

 CARL MAHON #2
mature animals are taken. They have a booming- crocket scoring on the sheep. I might state right at
this time that the desert bighorn sheep took the #2 trophy in the North American Continent. There are so few of them. The jaguar of Mexico and Central America was #1. This booming-crocket scoring is by measuring the base of the horn, the base of the circumference, measuring from the hairline to the end of the horn, the body of the fork and measuring the circumference at each fork and then adding these together. If they are not 144 booming-crocket points, 1 point per inch, or 7 1/2 years old they're declared illegal and the hunter is fined. We've only had two sheep that were taken that were under the seven years old. The one sheep scored 152 1/2 points, the other sheep took the small one, 105, ---?--- But at a distance with a good spotting scope, you have to have at least a 15- power scope and they prefer that you have a 20-power scope. They have given a schooling, and they have different size heads and things that they acquaint the hunter with, the legal sheep, before they go into the fields. With these spotting-scopes, after this five or six hours of schooling, the average person can go out and tell if a sheep is legal or illegal.
ss: Do the ewes live that long or can you tell? 73

 CARL MAHON #2
CM: We feel they do. The eldest sheep killed was 17 1/2
years old. The ewes also have horn rings. They have small horns. Some are curved a little bit and some just stick straight up in the air. They are small horns, maybe 1 inch or 2 or like that. A lot of people, the first time they see them they think they are goats. But they can be, age wise, the same as the rams. We feel that they sometimes live to be as much as 16 or so.
ss: Do they normally lamb every year?
CM: No, we found quite often that if it's a dry summer
the ewes do not conceive the years you thought they would and skip a year. Also the lambs are real defecable. The mineral deficiency causes lots of deaths. So it's not always easy to say whether a ewe has a lamb every year or not. We know this Mabel, I think has only missed one year since 1965, having a lamb. They have only one lamb in this area. One year she lost her lamb at about 5 months of age, but she had a lamb. They have their first lamb when they're about 2 years old. The places they take these little lambs, you would not believe it if you saw it, so I'm not going to try to describe exactly the type of area they take these little fellows. Within 15 or 20 minutes they're up on their feet and able to go
74

 CARL MAHON #2
through the rocks.
SS: In this area do they have any natural predatory animals?
CM: Well, there are lions and bobcats and coyotes. There has been one case where a kit-fox killed a lamb, but it wasn't in this area. Out in this area, we feel that probably the eagle [is another]. A lot of people are trying to protect the eagle and probably it's
just as well. But they can also kill lambs.
ss: Well, what is the greatest hazard for the lambs? Is it the strenuous environment they're in, I mean, is it the heat and the drought and this sort of thing?
Or is the greatest problem the predators?
CM: Well, I think that most of the lambs as near as we can tell--now in the fall of 1965 I found a bunch of ewes and I watched them for 2 1/2 hours. They went
down to a clay bank and they ate clay for 5 minutes. They would fight each other over this clay to see which one of them would eat it. ---?--- reported seeing---?--- along some of the old mining roads and he felt that they were eating roots that were on the edge of the berm along the edge of the road. I saw them eating this clay and I reported this. Then the following spring the Fish and Game gave him permission to take one animal so they could perform

an autopsy at Fort Collins, Colorado State. I went with him on this trip and we were following a bunch of quail. We found a deer antler that was originally a four-point and these sheep had just torn up a whole area fighting over this horn. It had started to decompose a little bit through the ears and they had eaten all the prongs down to where they had divided. So we suspected that there was a mineral deficiency. I put out ---?--- bone meal which was ---?--- in phosphorous. And at one time I had one ram walk up to me and eat 3 1/2 pounds at one time.
For heavens sake!

CM: This was a supplement that most of the better live-
stock operators would give the domestic livestock within the area. At the present time we are trying to set up a study with Dr. Lorne Harris of the Animal- Plant Department at Logan. He has been down and we've collected different plants and had them analyzed. We found that all the plants are deficient in this calcium, phosphorous and iodide. We hope to get a grant and take and work this out over a several year period. According to studies done at Colorado State, Utah State and Texas A&M, [this] shows that this could be the result of as much as 60 % loss of the increase of a bunch of sheep. Plus it could mean that

 CARL MAHON #2
the ewe would have at least four years less product life. In running over the area and in walking over it, I and different people that have been involved in this, we found more lamb carcasses than all other carcasses there. We feel that we are on the right track. Just what the portion of minerals they use, whether we can get it to them free choice, we don't know yet. If this carcasses programs goes as we hope
it will, we have a bet that they will be collecting blood-samples which they can analyze and determine what minerals are needed. Now this, a lot of people in wildlife field feel that this isn't necessary. But as much land as we are losing to urban-development, farms, highways, etc. prove to us that we are going to have to manage these wildlife animals just the same as a good rancher manages his livestock and the Europeans manage their wildlife. So we hope that this will be a program that will really get going in the
United States and help to keep these animals around. ss: Well, this has been interesting. Is there anything
else that you would like to add about them?
CM: Well, a lot of people may not realize it, but these bighorn sheep were not planted in here. Our first
record of white man was when Father Escalante came across Crossing of the Fathers of [the Rio] Colorado.

He said that the sheep were so plentiful they were almost like the---?---, and that was in 1740 [1776]. The pioneers found sheep when they first came across here. The first man that we interviewed was a man at the mouth of the Cajon in 1878. The pioneers that came over here in 1879 saw sheep and on the hieroglyphics, among the ancient ruins, the prehistoric ruins, ---?--- the sheep are depicted more than any other one anim al---?---.
SS: Then you guess that there was once a large native herd that has become smaller and smaller over the years?
CM: Right. They've compacted a lot of the ---?--- from the domestic herds, plus the hunters. I've interviewed a lot of these miners and I have recorded over 100 that were killed while the miners were here. There were so many of the people within the area, a lot of them were actually hungry and needed the meat, others just wanted to kill them because it was
something that they had never killed before. But we do feel that we are getting an increase with time. It's just hard to say. We have the Duchesne area over there that we have been trying to get a study started and we haven't been able to get a grant to do this. We also have sheep up and down the San Juan River. In
78

 CARL MAHON #2
fact, they have been seen about 12 miles below Bluff on the San Juan. So we have a small number scattered away all across along the San Juan drainage and the Colorado drainage clear above Moab, Utah. We just need a lot more information than we have today.
ss: Well, very good. It's been really fascinating and I've enjoyed it so much. I really thank you for your time and all this information.
CM: Well, these sheep are something I really enjoy and hope to keep around for a few more years.
