 T H I S I S MITCH HADDAD INTER VIEWING MR. JAMES B . LEE I N H I S OFFICE IN THE KEARNS BUILDING, JULY 29, 1970 AT FIVE 0 ' CLOCK IN THE EVENING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH-CAL STATE FULLERTON URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT
MH: Okay, Mr. Lee, the first thing I'd like to know is something about yourself.
JL: Well, I'm the treasurer of Parsons, Bailey, and Lattimore professional corporation, and the professional corporation practices law in the state of Utah. I'm a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, class of 1952. I graduated
MH: JL: MH:
JL:
MH: JL:
from George Washington University, class of 1960. I've been practicing law in Utah since 1962, and I've been with this firm since 1962. Is that enough? Enough. You graduated from West Point first?
Yes.
And then spent your four years in the army and then went to law school?
Three years. At that time, just a little over three years. And I came back and I was a research engineer with Kennecott Copper Corporation from 1955 through 1957, then I started law school in the fall of 1957. At George W ashington?
No, at Stanford University. I spent one year there and I was called back to active duty. And while I was on active duty at Fort Bel Air, Virginia, I decided
to resume school at night at G.W., and as soon as I

 JAMES
MH:
JL:
B . LEE # 1
was allowed to leave the service, I took a full schedule at George Washington University.
Now when were you first contacted with cases or legal
actions regarding the uranium industry?
I believe the first time I had contact with cases involving uranium would have been about 1964. Mr. Bailey, the senior partner in the firm, has been a mining lawyer for many years, and he asked me to take some of his work and to be a back-up man to him in the mining and water law areas in the state of Utah. And I had done some minor work when I first came to the firm on uranium claims in southeastern Utah, but really in a major way not until 1964. And it was after that that I started to do title work, particularly with respect to unpatented mining claims located in southeastern Utah.
Then most of your dealing has been with present day actions dealing with uranium?
I guess you could say present day actions, at least from 1964 until today.
MH:
JL:
MH: And during that period, what is the area or areas that present the largest legal problem?
JL: Well, anybody that's dealing with an abstract on the title to an unpatented mining claim knows that it's fraught with problems. People file notices, and
2

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
notices of an unpatented mining claim are not usually very clear as to the exact location. So when you're looking through an abstract, you're really not sure whether the claims that you're looking for that may be in conflict with your client's claims are really
in conflict. You have to read them carefully. And you're never really certain whether conflicting claimants made discoveries on their claims. You have the additional problem that you own clients may not have made discoveries within the concept of the federal statute, and within the---?--- of the state statute within the state of Utah. The ideal discovery
is most difficult. The burden put upon a mining claim is a stringent one. And now the Supreme Court, having said that it must be marketable as well as being type of ore that a prudent man would go after. It makes it a tremendous burden when you're reviewing abstracts because you're making judgments as to whether the claims are valid or not. And whether they're valid or not depends on what the facts are. And many times you don't have all of the facts, so in some instances you're making some pretty broad assumptions, and sometimes some wild guesses. But your client wants to know the best information possible as to whether or not he's got a valid claim or has some cloud on the
3

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
title such as possession. And, of course, the best you can do for him there is tell him that he had better be in actual possession and at the same time trying to make a discovery. I would say that the problem of abstracts on unpatented mining claims and reviewing them is one of the most difficult.
MH: Uh huh. Now this is a problem which is manifested even more by the attitude by the Department of Interior, isn't it?
JL: I would think so because the Department of Interior has taken it upon themselves the idea that they are the trustees of the property of the United States for all of the people. That's the attitude that they presently have. And as a result, they're not satisfied with what many people would call a discovery, and they put you to your proof if you're trying to get a patent. I think the end result is that many mining claimants decide not to seek a mining patent. Why taken on the government if you don't have to unless you're satisfied there's a very good reason to go to patent. So most of them will say, "Well, I have an unpatented mining claim. I
think I have a discovery. The government hasn't challenged me on it yet. They don't have the money or the time to go after every unpatented claim at the
4

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
preset time, so I don't think I'll patent it. I ' ll let it sit as it is, and I'll try to develop it. And
if I have an ore body is good there, then it's good anyway. All I have to do is do a hundred dollars' work on that claim each year." And that's not too difficult to do when you have a large company that's investing a lot of money, or a small company that has a good ore strike.
Now when you speak of the processes of going into a patent, now basically, by statute a patent is a fairly simple thing designed to protect the claims of the miner, originally. I mean, what is it, something like a fifteen dollar fee?
No, five dollars per acre.
Five dollars per acre?
Uh huh.
And you go through the adjudicating process like subhearings, and ---?--- originally it was to be issued. Now have they sort of blockaded that?
MH:
JL: MH: JL: MH:
JL: Well, I guess--I suppose you could use the expression blockaded. But my own feeling is that the Department of Interior and Land Management have felt that the system was misused for many years, that many years people secured patent, fee title without really having a mining claim. And the feeling is now that if
5

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
you have a mining property and you can prove it, they'll give you the patent, but they're going to make it most difficult for you to prove it. And just
coming in and saying you found a little ore is not going to be enough. They're going to have to be satisfied that that ore is marketable. And by marketable, I mean you could make a profit at selling the ore. And so I'm not as prone as some to say that they're blockading. I just think they're tougher today than they have been in the past in proving patents. On the other hand, I'm informed by counsel in Sante Fe that securing patents in New mexico is not any more difficult than it used to be. I know in this state it's more difficult.
MH: Now, is the area that we've been discussing, the patent area and unpatented mining claims, is this the area of largest legal action now?
JL: I'm not sure how to answer that question. There have not been too many significant cases in the state of Utah in the last, oh, seven or eight years regarding the mining properties. The few that I'm acquainted
with, Ranchers versus Anaconda, were involving beryllium claims, not uranium claims. But the principles that were espoused there are certainly applicable to uranium problems. I think when you talk
6

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
about cases that really don't have a large group of cases in the uranium field in the last six or seven years, the problems that we have are much like this: The uranium deposits in southeastern Utah are located at great depths. To make a discovery, you've got to have some ore. That means drilling a hole. And it's
expensive to drill a hole twenty-five hundred feet. You need a large rig and are going to pay anywhere from ten thousand to sixty thousand dollars on that hole, depending on what kind of material you run into. Many of the companies are putting together large blocks. It's uneconomical for them to drill on every hole. So what they do is spot drill based on their geologists' best guess where to put down the holes, and find out if they have an ore body that they can project based upon the drilling and upon the geology. If they do, then they say, "Well, we may not have discoveries on each and every claim, but we would argue that by inference that if a claim is in between two drill holes that there is probably uranium on that ground." Well, whether or not that's enough today under the laws of this state and particularly under the federal decisions in this state, I'm not certain. Judge Christiansen indicated in the Anaconda-Ranchers case that he felt that
7

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
probably the inference could not be made, although he did not completely discard the idea, and felt at the same time that the Supreme Court of the United States
said you have to have a discovery on each and every claim. We do have a doctrine of pedis possessio, which means you can be in real possession of a mining claim until you make a discovery. Most mining people recognize that you just don't go out and make a discovery and then stake the claim as the statute would suggest; what you do is stake the ground and then try to make a discovery in the uranium field. So if you've gone into an expensive drilling program, and then you decide to sink a shaft as is being done
in southeastern Utah near La Sal, you could argue that you're in peaceable possession of the other claims until you get the shaft down, so that you can project the shaft at deep levels off into claims where you haven't drilled, and hopefully make a discovery that way. And I am inclined to think that our federal court in this state would accept that sort of a preference if you had been diligently pursuing a discovery by sinking a shaft. Because to sink a shaft at the depths we're talking about will cost anywhere from two and a half to three million dollars. And certainly anybody that is spending that
8

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
kind of money is diligently pursuing discovery, in my opinion. So the real problem in the uranium field today is, do we have a discovery? How long can you possess claims before you make a discovery? Can you possess a large block where you've only put down ten or eleven holes and you've got 140, 150 claims, and argue possessio, I don't know. But I know that the practice is yes. That's what many mining companies are doing today, they're arguing that they won't spend all that money for drilling. That they'll save
it to go down with a shaft. And I'm inclined to think that the court would probably go along with them if they had been diligently pursuing discovery.
So then in short, today the courts are--there's a tendency there to bend the concept of pedis possessio from--might statutorily look like--! mean.
Well, I think--
Because of technological changes.
Yes. I don't like to use the word "bend", but let's say "extend".
Okay. Because of technology, though, primarily?
That's right. Uh huh. We're better able--geologists are--with what's available today to project what's down there. Neither you nor I can see to great depths in the earth's surface, nor anyone else, to determine
MH:
JL: MR: JL:
MH: JL:
9

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
what the size of an ore body may be. But by using a reasonable drilling program laid out by a geologist who's knowledgeable in the area, where gets good
samples and results at a certain depth, then he can project a certain picture, I think the court can accept that today, particularly in view of the amount of money that's being spent.
This brings to mind another question. And this is the affect, say, of a changing society in mining technology and mining methods and everything else on the mining laws. Now the basic laws, for example, for lode claims were passed in 1866, and (?) placer in 1870, and a composite law in 1872. And it really hasn't changed a whole bunch since that, has it?
MH:
JL: Hasn't changed--you've hit it on the head. It hasn't changed a whole bunch; it hasn't changed substantially. And those laws are really designed for such minerals as gold, silver where there is a vein and where you can find a general surface, and that's what they were talking about. Today we're talking about uranium which is at great depths, at least with the clients I have, and how do you make a discovery? And really are those laws applicable? I think the courts are trying to make the best adjustment they can in view of the law. And there's been great
10

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
discussion in some cases in Wyoming as to whether or not uranium in level beds, horizontal beds, was in
fact a placer, as opposed to a lode type claim. But the courts made a pretty good accommodation by saying, "Well, if there was some sort of vein there, not matter which way it went, you could argue it was a lode claim." I think that really most of the people in the mining industry in this state that are in the uranium business, are sort of reaching an agreement that you don't find uranium by just going out and staking the ground and saying it's there. You have to drill it. And if the ground opens up as it did on their navigation site here in June, then there'll be a real race to get on the ground with a rig. You've got simultaneous filings by four companies. All filed notice of location on the same day, same--staked out the same time. Now who has the priority? I think that it's understood by all that it's the first one that makes the discovery. So one fellow goes out with a little rig and drills down four hundred feet, and claims he's got into the Morrison. He's made a strike. Another company, a large company just would not believe that would constitute a discovery. So what do they do? They bring in a big rig and they drill down two thousand feet and find what they
11

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
believe to be the real body of uranium ore in that claim or group of claims. And so, I think it's fairly well understood that the laws had to be looked at and applied the best that they could be in the uranium
situation.
MH: This brings to mind another question of legislation
or needed changes or attempts at changing mining law. And I know this Public Land Law Review Commission, and different other bodies of legal people dealing in the area have made several suggestions.
JL: American Mining Congress among others. Well, yes. Public Land Law Review Commission suggested that they be given some right to possession; maybe a permit should be issued by the Bureau of Land Management to allow you to happen to be first on the ground to preserve your position while you attempt to make discovery. And instead of having claims 600 by 1,500, they ought to really be stated in terms of
description based upon sections. So that you're talking quarter sections of 40 acres, or you're talking half sections of 80, or full section of 160. And I'm speaking of the full quarter-section: 64 acres to the full square mile. And they think that this would be much better. And then if you do make a discovery, then they would allow you to go ahead and
12

 JAMES B. LEE #1
file what would be called an unpatented mining claim. But this system occurs to me to be a compromise between many factions, and I'm not sure but what the suggestion of the Public Land Law Review Commission is the answer in this area. The question I would have is, who is first in time on the ground. And how do you decide who should get the permit to make discovery? And then how do you decide if there is a discovery there? Who should have the right to the unpatented mining claim? I suppose I'm more inclined to think that if you want a system that makes some
sense, that maybe leasing, as we do with oil and gas, and those minerals of the 1920 Act that are described for leasing purposes, maybe we ought to go to leasing. The difficulty with that is that it really ultimately does away with the little miner concept, although I'm not so sure that the 1ittle miner can mine uranium anymore. The material that's close to the surface has apparently been pretty well searched out. These companies today are going much deeper, and the little guy just can't get that kind of money. So when they say, "Well, you do away with the unpatented mining claim and the patent system that we have, then you're going to hurt the little guy." I'm not sure
whether the little guy benefits anymore anyway. 13

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
That's why some of those people who are proposing leasing system may have the right idea. One thing about a leasing system, it's clear who's got the title. The United States government has it. And you don't have to go through all the chaos of searching
out in an abstract for recorded unpatented mining claims to see if you've got any conflict on the ground. When you go over there, all they can tell you is if the ground is open for mining claimant or for leasing. They can't tell you how many claims have been staked, because they're not in that business. So perhaps there needs to be some amendment. Certainly to the extent they ought to recognize what a uranium claim is, and the problems with it. And maybe they ought to have some doctrine that would allow you some reasonable possession to make a discovery and put a limitation on it. The year--or something that would make sense in terms of the type of holes that you're going to have to drill, or the shafts that you'd have to sink.
MH: How pressing are these problems legally? I mean, how much are these changes really needed? Like how frustrating it is really when you go to court in mining cases?
JL: Because there's a fairly decent understanding between 14

 JAMES
B. LEE # 1
the mining companies that are in the uranium business and the people who are in the field, the geologists, and the land men, there really isn't that much
litigation over uranium claims. Many of the conflicts are resolved between attorneys and their clients working together buying out some sort of an interest that they may have, and you're not sure if they do, but they'll quit-claim their interests to you because they don't have the money to develop the property. Many times when there is a conflict, companies will ignore it. They'll have a large block and some fellow will claim that he has prior claims on a portion of the block. They'll take a look at what they're doing and analyze it. His interference is of a very minor nature, almost minimal as far as they're concerned because the ore body is not located under those conflicting claims. So what they do is just ignore it. And unless he institutes an action, they do the best they can to keep him off, saying "We're in peaceable possession, it's ours." And he says it's his, and that's as far as it ever goes. And unless they either start to disturb the surface of his claims by putting some material there or doing development work, no action is commenced. The large company doesn't want to commence an action because
15

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
they don't care. The little guy doesn't know how much the big company has, the extent of the ore body. And
if he goes and spends a lot of money to protect his interests, he may find out he has nothing anyway, so what you find is an accommodation today, at least in Utah. Now I'm aware that the problems in New Mexico were a number of court cases where conflicting claims were involved, but in those instances the parties were rather certain as to what they had in the way or uranium deposit beneath the surface, and they were willing to spend the money to fight. But we haven't had many real conflicting claims cases in the last
few years in this state.
MH: I'm mostly curious as to--now you mentioned before
the good relationship between land men, geologists, and the large companies. This is kind of contradictory, to say the least, considering the reason why all the anti-trust litigation began why all the trouble started before, you know, the onerous big company versus the little miner. And it's kind of all changed then, hasn't it? -
JL: Well, I would say this, when I said "An understanding," I mean that I think they all understand the ground rules pretty well. And when they're in the field, if they're out with their
16

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
company and they've staked claims and they really feel that they have a right to be there, and someone else comes along and says, "Well, you've overstaked some of our claims," and they're told about it, generally instead of getting into a lawsuit, as I said, they either ignore the problem and wait until
it becomes a very important one if there's a rich deposit. Or if they find out it isn't a rich deposit, it dies. So what I really meant to say is that the ground rules are well understood even in the uranium business about what's necessary to make a discovery. This is kind of something new in a way from what happened before though?
That's right.
The ground rules weren't understood before?
Yeah, that's right.
So could this be the result of the court decisions which have been handed down, the successive ones, since the boom happened until now?
Well, I would think so.
Yes, because people don't want to stub their toes again.
Yes, and it's expensive--litigation is. And I think another thing, the uranium people have found that it's expensive. Rather than stand the expense, they
MH:
JL: MH: JL: MH:
JL: MH:
JL:
17

 JAMES B . LEE # 1
think twice now before getting into a lawsuit.
MH: This raises another question. I'm curious as to the nature actually of this in Utah particularly. It seems like even though there was such a boom in the uranium mining business--! mean an actual boom in the
fifties, and then settling down, but still predominant, there still is fairly sizable mining in this state dealing with, not only uranium, but also other hardrock minerals. And yet there has been the most noticeable lack of violence ever recorded in the mining industry. It's a curious phenomenon. Do you think the people did go to the courts?
JL: Well, I think they did. In the Anaconda case, which again wasn't uranium, but involved beryllium, but the type of material, the deposits were similar. There was some violence there. The attorney for Anaconda who was in a firm here in Salt Lake, and is now vice- president of Anaconda, was picked up by the president of the ranchers and thrown to the ground, broke three ribs. And the president of the Ranchers led a group of dozers onto the property and said, "We'll run you over if you get in the way." And an injunction was secured from a district judge down there to enjoin this violence, a local judge in Nephi. And then one
of the other parties threw it into the federal court 18

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
before Judge Ritter, and he wouldn't tolerate any such violence. And I think that message has got home to many of the mining operators that the judges won't
tolerate it, and they'll find themselves in jail if there is violence. I would think that accounts for part of it. Another factor is that with the limited number of attorneys who practice mining law in the state of Utah, they're constantly opposed to each other, whether it's in court or representing clients
in negotiations on conflicting claims, and they have a pretty good understanding. And at least my experience with the attorneys in the mining business is that none of them will tolerate violence. I know as a matter of fact in the ranchers case, that one of them told his client that if he continued, he was stepping out of the lawsuit. He would not represent him because he did not want to become involved in any
violence. So there has been, I suppose you could call it, a lack of violence. I'm not sure that we really have that many major uranium deposits where people have been in conflict. Charly Steen staked his Mi Vida claims, and there was some question about overlapping, but the heart of his claims were never questioned. And for that reason I don't think that Mr. Steen and his people ever felt the had to shoot
19

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
anybody that came onto the property. It seemed to be pretty well understood where Steen's property was. Today in southeastern Utah a development by a Canadian mining company is pretty well understood where their claims are. They're staked well, and they have people who patrol the property who recognize the multiple-use purpose, that ranch people have a right
to be on the land grazing, that the B.L.M. has access to the property, that the miner himself can do what he wants on the surface as long as it's something that's directly connected with the mining venture and doesn't interfere with the other rights. I think these things are pretty well understood today. You get some problems, people pushing a little bit. But I don't think you ever see violence. Most of the time people are inclined to say, "I'm going to get the sheriff and throw you off," and the sheriff's response is, "Well, these are unpatented mining claims and they're in conflict, so I don't know who I should throw off. And I would suggest you start a lawsuit. If you don't start a lawsuit, I'm not going to throw anybody off. You can both get on it. You can both do what you want to do, but I don't want any violence. If you shoot each other, then I'll be out here putting somebody in jail, but if you're just
20

 JAMES B. LEE #1
saying, 'it's my property,' I really don't know whose property it is."
So then in essence they do say, "Go to a lawsuit if you have conflict," rather than, you know, kind of-- well, it's a large analogy, but it's like back in the 1849 gold rush of California. I mean, the rootin'- tootin' cliche, you know, wild and wooly. And they didn't even know what a lawyer was then.
That's right.
From all I can gather, especially considering the fact that judges like Judge Ritter and Judge Christiansen and others who have sat on the bench for such a long time that there is a definite understanding that the courts are not only experienced in the litigation of mining claims, but also they're knowledgeable, and people would have a tendency to respect their decisions a little bit more.
MH:
JL: MH:
JL:
I think they would be well aware of what either of those two judges on the federal bench in this state would do in a conflict case. They apply the law pretty clearly. So I think you find--well, you just don't find violence. There's a little bit, but not very often.
MH: This brings then another legal question coming in, 21

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
and that is, the tax and security aspects of uranium mining industry. I mean such large sums of money exchanged hands, and there are always legal problems as a result over who gets what and how it's
incorporated and different things such as this. Is
this still pretty much of a problem?
JL: There's still a tremendous risk for anyone that's
dealing with an unpatented mining claim. And yet because mining companies know that if they're in possession, and if they have a discovery, and if they continue in possession, they can probably mine without too much difficulty, and so they're probably willing to take that chance. They know that the depth at which the ore bodies are located is significant, and anybody trying to locate those ore bodies is going to have to spend a substantial amount of money. And if they're on the property and there's no sign of anybody else being there, and they're drilling making a discovery, and nobody comes in to throw them off, and their program runs two or three years, and they finish their drilling program, and they start, they decide to sink a shaft on unpatented mining claims, they, after two or three years, I think they feel reasonably certain that nobody is going to come in and try to kick them off. They would have kicked them
22

 JAMES B . LEE # 1
before they started a drilling program, or at least stopped them before they spent so much money on the program.
MH: Okay, let's shift to conservation. This is an area you made a comment on before. Now this would seem to be the most booming legal problem area coming up in mining. This whole move toward ecology and conservation, and their influences within the government as well as the society. Now how can this
affect mining law?
JL: Well, mining companies are not unsophisticated, and
they've had a lot of experience in a lot of areas involving air and water pollution. The mining companies that are coming into southeastern Utah that are starting mining ventures and have, number one, a problem of disposing of water after processing. They have contacted the state water pollution control authority. They've submitted plans, they've had those plans approved, and they've worked very closely with the state committee. In terms of air pollution down in southeastern Utah, you really don't have that as a problem at this time because you don't have a smelter like Kennecott has in the Salt Lake V alley. You' re
talking about a mill, and a mill has very little in the way of air pollution. You may have a tailing pile
23

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
and that could be a problem with the wind blowing and putting particulates into the air. However, the tailing piles that I'm aware of are located in areas where if they did blow, they wouldn't bother human
inhabitants, humans, because humans aren't around those particular areas. Now maybe if they're not built far enough away they will. But I suspect that those people in southeastern Utah want industry so bad that they're willing to, say, put up with a 1ittle bit unless it becomes unbearable. But these companies don't ignore their requirements. They know that the state has requirements in air pollution. They know that the federal government is in the process of establishing air quality regions. Although the air quality regions suggested for this state do not encompass any of the area in southeastern Utah. It's located right here in Salt Lake County, Utah County, Davis and Weber Counties, and part of Box Elder. And that's all. So in terms of federal standards, they don't have any problems down there. Now if you're talking about reclamation, presently there is no federal act that requires one on unpatented mining claims to fix the land up like it was, although I suspect that's coming. That's one of the recommendations of the Public Land Law Review
24

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
Commission. And I'm certainly not going to resist that sort of legislation because I'd like to see the land returned as best it can be by a mining company. But that will become a major consideration. If a mining company knows it has to reclaim land, and
they've gone in and put an open pit in, or they've built a substantial ---?--- that they're going to have to plant trees and grass to make that attractive after they leave the area, that will become a big factor in deciding to go into an area in the first place. But at the present time that's not a factor because it's not required by state or federal law in Utah to reclaim the land. They can just walk off when their time is up.
MH: This could be carried, too, nationally. I mean, the mining law is something which pertains to all of the United States. For example, like A laska--what's happened to Alaska is the Department of Interior has almost literally closed it off. I mean just basically for assessment, but they're also given conservation reasons. Well, I mean--
JL: They could do the same here in the United States, and I anticipate that's coming. But at the present time it's not a requirement. And so mining companies starting out in the sixties were not concerned, but
25

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
today they may start giving some serious consideration. But if the company spent substantial amounts of money in the last three or four years, they're not going to be facing some reclamation laws that would require them to go back in and reclaim the land and do what's necessary to make it productive again, particularly the surface.
MH: So then, basically, if it were to be narrowed down, what would you consider then to be the largest problems facing the mining industry or uranium mining today legally?
JL: Well, one of the largest problems is going to be meeting the federal requirements on mine safety. Most states, at least in this state, we have a safety act, and it's enforced by state mine inspectors. And they do a reasonable job, but I think Congress was never
satisfied that there were good standards across the country. So they've provided now two types of standards, one for open pit mining, and one for underground, where the mine is involved in interstate commerce. That almost includes every mine because the uranium products are going to be shipped out of the state, so this will allow federal inspectors to come in. And, of course, under the federal act, it allows the state to adopt standards. If they're acceptable
26

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
to the federal government, those will be the ones used. If the state doesn't adopt standards, then the
federal government's standards will become applicable. So I think that's one of the major problems. That's why the ventilation shafts that are going in on the uranium mines are much larger than they used to be just to meet the ventilation requirement; cut down on the radon gas and make sure that the other gases don't build up. This is going to be one of the significant cost factors for people getting into the uranium business. The second problem, the one that will be with us until the act is amended, and will always be a problem, is the uncertainty of an unpatented mining claim. Your title to id, you right to be in possession is contingent upon the discovery which, as everybody knows, is hanging up in the air, and there is great dispute between lawyers as to what is an adequate discovery. I'm sure some lawyers are telling clients a little different than what other lawyers are. But I'm sure all of them are aware of the Supreme Court decision of '68, and so I would say that one of the major problems is the security of an unpatented mining claim.
MH: When you say the Supreme Court decision in '68, are 27

 JAMES B. LEE #1
you talking about Caldwell versus the United States?
JL: I don't think that's the name of the case. As a matter of fact, I keep the thing on my desk so I won't forget it. Coleman. United States versus
Coleman.
MH: Coleman. That dealt with marketability? That in order
to have a patent, you must have a product which is
marketable at that particular time?
JL: Yeah. What the Supreme Court did adopt was what the
Department of Interior had been saying for years, and that is, that the prudent man applies. But one of the factors in the prudent man test will e the marketability factor, and it's pretty hard to quarrel with. Decisions in Utah on what is discovery won't even talk about marketability, even the most recent ones. They talked about what a prudent man was-- first, you find an ore, and after you find some kind of ore, would a prudent man attempt to develop that as a mine? That's the test and it's a pretty easy one to make. What's a prudent man? I don't know. It is Joe Blow that doesn't have any money that wants to go down and grub by himself? He may be a prudent man. Is it the big mining company that has to spend a couple of million dollars? I don't know. But I know that the standards are different. For instance, there are some
28

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
lawyers who argue that this standards, marketability, only applies in a litigation with the U.S. Government if they're coming to throw you off the property for trespassing, or if you're in a patent litigation with them, trying to prove discovery. But--and saying on the other hand that the test between conflicting claimants is much less, that the man who can show any kind of discovery, if he has found an ore body or a strike of ore and was there first that he'll prevail; and the argument being that this marketability test should only really apply to the federal government where they're either trying to boot you off for trespassing, or you're trying to complete a patent, and they're trying to protect the government's
interest. I don't agree with that. I think this marketability test under Coleman would pertain to any litigation involving any question of discovery because it was addressed to that statute which defines what is necessary to have a location, and I don't see how you get around it. Someday that'll be litigated.
MH: So then, in essence, if there is a claim in conflict, if a man was there first, and he was there because he knew the product would be marketed at that time, he'd
have a more feasible claim than, say, an earlier 29

 JAMES B . LEE # 1
claim who decided to come back? Then we would g e t into the shell game again?
JL: That's right.
MH: Here's another question I have. This is a factor,
say, isn't it, a thing that a lawyer must be aware of where these companies are bringing them back, revitalizing old claims?
JL: Yeah, I think anybody that's dealing on the stock market with a uranium company, and particularly an old one, or even some of the new ones, would want to knew what assets the company has.
MH: They have to under the SEC rules, don't they?
JL: They do, but the trouble is the evaluation of the asset. In the evaluation, for instance, the company officials tell the accountant, "W ell, these are
unpatented mining claims and geologists tell us we got a uranium strike, and we evaluate it at five million bucks." And somebody legal says, "Have you put a mine in?" "No." "What have you got?" "Oh, a couple of drill holes." "And on the basis of that you're projecting five million dollars? I don't think you can do it." So what I'm saying is, you ought to look at the claim, and you ought to look at the evaluation placed on it by the company, and you can overreach because it's a question of judgment. And
30

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
it's only your judgment versus mine on the value of certain property based on the drill samples that we read. My geologist may say, "Hell, it's not worth a penny. I wouldn't give it any value because we're not sure what we've got there yet. We've got some ore, but we don't know the extent of it. We don't know if we want to mine it." And, of course, in these shell games, the evaluation that is placed by accountants go over the lot. And in the Texas Company case they
had an accountant in Utah who evaluated the property at forty-five thousand, and then they didn't like it, so they took it to Texas, and the Texas accountant put a value of two and a half million on the same claim. So it's easy to skin people because nobody knows the value of an unpatented mining claim.
MH: So then, in essence, it's al back to the same question. The idea of a patent actually becomes more and more important when you think about it in regard to mining and mining law.
JL: If you're talking in terms of what people own, all you get with an unpatented mining claim is the right to exclusive possession. The fee is owned by the United States.
MH: Uh huh. But to get fee title, you have to have a-- JL: To get a fee title you have to have a patent, that's
31

 JAMES B. LEE #1
right. But you don't even get that anymore because they' 11 reserve that themselves. All you' 11 get is the mineral interest and the right to use the surface to the extent necessary to develop the minerals.
MH: You mean, that's even if you're granted a patent?
JL: That's right. It used to be you got the fee, but not anymore. So that means if you get a mineral patent today, you'd get the minerals, the right to use the surface ---?--- as necessary, but not the right to
have exclusive possession.
MH: So then we've dealt with several areas. Some of--a
lot of them are long reaching. I mean, really, they're areas that were there before which haven't been cleared up even today.
JL: That's correct.
MH: So in a way, that could lead to a question. Are there
thoughts running through people, lawyers, legal authorities; minds that the mining laws are actually antiquated?
JL: There are a number of mining lawyers who believe that to be a true statement, and I don't know if I could disagree with that concept. There are lawyers who do believe the laws are antiquated. And that may be true. I think there's been a very good adaptation of
the law to fit the uranium problem. I'11 tell you 32

 JAMES B. LEE #1
what I foresee. There is a great need for land in this country, and we known what's happening with the population boom. We know it's expanding. We know that people like to use the national parks, and that they're now jammed up, and you have to make reservations in some. I don't think the American public in the next few years are going to tolerate misuse of the public lands. And by that I mean
they're not going to want patents issued to a lot of that land. They're going to want to protect it. There's already a lot of that land. They're going to want to protect it. There's already a lot of land committed in school sections to various Western states that have to be given up under statute, and ultimately on survey. And so what the people are going to be saying is, "We ought to change the law. And we ought to make companies that go out on the public domain to get minerals do certain things, such as make the land look beautiful and let's not have erosion and let's not have pollution. And if they do have pollution, you throw them off the land." And so, think what the mining companies in the uranium business face, like many others that are on public land, are going to be a number of statutes, and whose
ultimate goal is to make certain public lands 33

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
available for use for many years to come. So the rnultiple-use acts which we've had in the last few years, and which have had substantial impact, are going to be even broader, and they're going to be
enforced. And I think you're going to see the government spending money through the BLM to come down and kick mining claimants off property if they really don't have discoveries. They're going to try to clean up the title situation. And I'm not against that. I think it's a pretty good idea. I don't believe a person ought to be able to squat if he's not going to do something about trying to develop it as a mining property, and properly develop it.
Just like adopting a land system similar to that in Canada, right, where everything is noted and recorded, and the government can say, "This is open and this is open," and that would clear up a lot of the title action.
That's right. And I think it's corning. I think the only reason BLM hasn't done more is because of lack of funds.
BLM? Bureau of Land Management?
Bureau of Land Management.
Okay. We have to make that clear.
Right. They're in the Department of the Interior.
MH:

 JAMES B . LEE # 1
MH: Right.
JL: And responsible for managing a great deal of lands in
our country--distinctions between types of lands, the public domain and the acquired lands, the lands that were owned by somebody else, but the United States government has got back, I think that's nonsense. WE make a distinction today--you can go in and lease those lands for hardrock purposes. Why should we have a distinction? It doesn't make any sense. The Public Land Law review Commission pointed that out. But in terms of what I see in the future, I think you're
going to see a greater use of the public domain, but it's going to be done in a method so it's not destroyed.
MH: And legally done in a method so it's not--I mean the laws will state this.
JL: Yeah, I think you're going to see a change. I just don't see how we can get away from it. And mining lawyers are going to be faced with advising their clients. "Well, you're going to have to change your mode of operation in some instances. Your going to
have to spend a lot more time worrying about the ecology of--and what you're doing down there on that uranium property. You just can't leave a hole in the ground and walk away."
35

 JAMES B . LEE # 1
MH: So, is there anything else you'd 1ike to add, 1ike
any other area that we may have missed in regard to,
you know, present day mining laws, or--
JL: Well, I think that mining companies are going to face problems with water. They always have in the arid states of this country. But I think the government may start asserting that they have ownership to water on the federal lands. In the past, there have been acts that have stated that if a miner appropriated the water in accordance with the state law, then he
had a right to that water.
MH: What acts were those?
JL: Oh, these go back and they're in the mining acts
sections. I'd have to go look them up for you. But it means if I'm a miner I can go out there and I can drill a hole if I can an application from the state engineer from the state of Utah, and if I can use that water beneficially, but it's not my water. I don't own the water; I own the right to use the water. Well, the federal government, through the Department of Interior, is now asserting and not very vigorously but there's a question as to whether or not, since they own the land, whether they own the waters that are contained within the lands--the ---?--- Doctrine, whether the ---?--- Doctrine is
36

 JAMES
B . LEE # 1
foreign to the eight Western states which follow the appropriation doctrine, which is the right of beneficial use to water on a first come, first serve, with some changes to that, of course, by state law. And I think one day you're going to find mining companies that have filed applications maybe facing
federal government if they get the time and the money and say, "Well, that's not your water. If you want to use if, you're going to have to pay for it, or enter into some agreement." But I don't see that as an immediate problem. I see that further down the road as the need for water becomes more and more critical.
MH: So it is kind of a tying string, this whole move toward ecology. You eventually have to conserve and yet keep a booming mining business, or keep the resources active. So you've got sort of two things going?
JL: That's right.
MH: In the legal handling of both sides, it's kind of
like facing two walls isn't it?
JL: I'm not aware of any plant to put legislation through
the Utah State legislature to require mining companies to reclaim lands, to do what they can to cut down on erosion, and dust storms off---?---. But in the states of Idaho and Colorado you have such
37

 JAMES B. LEE #1
acts today, and mining companies are faced with trying to work under those acts. And it may be something that will just happen in our state. Some
legislature will get notice of those acts and say, "Let's have one of our own." And then the question comes up. Can they order you on the public domain, which belongs to the United States, to reclaim the land? I don't know. It may be a good jurisdictional question as to whether they can or not, but they do, the mining company will have to face the problem of how they respond.
MH: Okay, thank you.
