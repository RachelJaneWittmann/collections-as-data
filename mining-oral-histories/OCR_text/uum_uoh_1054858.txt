 THE FOLLOWING I S AN INTERVIEW CONDUCTED BY HARRY HENSLICK ON AUGUST, 15, 1970. THE INTERVIEWEE IS JOHN GALLEY AT MRS. GALLEY'S HOME.
HH: Mr. Galley, we are back here today and you have been so kind as to give us these pictures, we're going to make copies up for our collection and they are very valuable. Maybe they're not as valuable to us as they are to you, but when you consider the number of people who will be
able to use them, and look at them, and get some ideas of the conditions, they are every valuable and beautiful pictures. I certainly want to thank you for allowing us to make copies.
JG: Well, you see, on the postcard size, I took all of those, but these other like this are ones people have given me and that's the reason that I'm anxious to keep them.
HH: Right, and we'll make very sure that we don't lose them or do anything with them, other than get a copy of them and then we'll get them back to you. We talked yesterday, and after we talked, just about the time I was ready to leave, I know a couple of points came up that perhaps we should have mentioned on the tape and we had not and so I'm back today and we said, perhaps we could mention a
couple of those and if we have any other things to say,
we'll have a short interview this afternoon.
JG: Well, one thing I would like to mention is how the "Joe Jr.", Joe Jr., Camp got its name. Joseph M. Flannery was president of the company and his oldest son was named

 JOHN GALLEY
Joe, so he named that camp and mill after his son Joe, Jr.
And so actually, it was Standard Chemical Mill, but it was called Joe Jr. Camp. This was during the time that
HH:
JG:

JG:
they had owned the property and controlled it.
From the time it was started. From the time it was at least one mining claim, it was Joe Jr. Mining Claim during the---?---
I see. How about the Joe Dandy Camp? Did that have any tie-in whatsoever or was that entirely different?
Well, that's entirely different. Originally, that was owned by the Crucible Steel Co., and then it passed down, I believe that Standard bought from the Crucible Steel Co.
I see.
A good many of those claims over on that side. And I don't know how they come to know Joe Dandy. It was rich claims over in that side and it may have been that that is where the Joe Dandy came in, I couldn't say to that. Let's see, was there some other point that we were going to talk about here?
Well, you were going to mention about the power. During the time they was using the water power, that was intermittent on account it had to depend on the rise and fall of the river. When the river was up, they had plenty
2

 JOHN GALLEY
of power, but when it was down with the snow in the upper country gone, why there was no power. They had to shut the mill down, so they put in some auxilary gas engines,
HH:
I believe they had either four, either three or four and they connected them on to the big generators in the power plant that had the water wheel.
We have a very good picture here of within the power house there, and on the right-hand corner in the foreground we can see the foundation apparently where one of the first of those engines were connected. It was tied down.
Here was the water plant down here and then there was others that came in here. I think it was three. And then when they got the big diesel you'll notice that on that picture, the building, its an oblong building like that, and that's where they installed the big diesel plant.
I see.
So that they was right in line they put in one and then later on they put in another one. No, they just had the one.
Even after they had installed the diesel though, they had that plant still intact so that if they wished they could fall back on the water power to run the mill.
But they never had to.
Did they do it just temporarily, at all, or did they just

 JOHN GALLEY
never go back to it?
JG:
HH:
JG:
HH: JG:
HH:
JG:
Well, they never had to. They didn't operate so very long after that. You see, about '23 was the last time, I believe, that they operated fully. So they wasn't running very long.
Have you thought of anything else since we talked that you wish you would have thought of, any anecdotes or stories about individuals that might help, you know, kind of draw a character profile of some of these people.
I know Mr. Mullen, when he was here, he was quite a community post here for the whole country when he was in here.
Was he an easterner sent here by the company?
Yeah, he was from around Pittsburgh, he graduated from Notre Dame and Mr. Flannery sent him out when they first started to build the mill.
Apparently the Flannery brothers had more reason than just the economics to push the radium production.
Mr. Flannery's mother died of cancer and he vowed that if--they had an idea that radium would have saved her life--and he vowed that if he could produce radium that
would be his life's work.
Did you know Joseph Flannery? Y eah.
HH:
JG:
HH: What kind of man was he? What was his stature?
4

 JOHN GALLEY
JG: Well, he was a big man, like that picture of Mullen.
Maybe a little taller and a very nice man to deal with. HH: Quite pleasant to work for?
JG: Yeah, pleasant to work for.
HH: Did he make any trips into the mill here? Or where did he
reside?
JG: Well, he didn't come out very often. But he had men in
HH: JG: HH: JG: HH: JG:
HH:
JG:
HH:
the Pittsburgh office come out.
I see. Did you meet him here or did you--?
I met him here.
Where did he stay when he came?
He stayed at camp there.
He stayed right camp.
Yeah, yeah. They had a little house here. This was the guest house and that's where he lived and the boarding house was right in here.
The one next--so it was about the third one from this side. Over here was the one you were staying in.
This was mine and this was the engineers and this was the guest house. He was just a common man when he was out here.
Did he have quite a sense of humor or --
JG: Yes, he did.
HH: And it showed.
JG: It seemed like everybody in camp was the same way. It was
5

 JOHN GALLEY
a very congenial bunch to work with.
HH: Did that go for Blair Burwell when he was, would you say that he had a lot of, a large sense of humor, or dry sense of humor, or what kind?
JG: Yes, Burwell was ready for everything that came along. HH: Was he? Mr. Verray, I talked to him yesterday evening and he brought up the story that you told me about the time you staged the holdup for one of the fellows. Sounds like
you must have had a good time doing that.
JG: Yeah, we had lots of fun. Well, nobody had a car and of course we would go together and hire a car and come to the dance. There was a dance every Saturday night in Nucla. We danced till about three o'clock and we'd get
home, in the wintertime when we had to come by horse, team and buggy, we'd get home just in time for breakfast. Pretty cold ride in the wintertime in a buckboard.
HH: That's a pretty full trip, though when you don't get back 'till about that time.
JG: But we all enjoyed it. We had good times. We had to make our own amusement, though.
HH: What kind of things would you do for amusement in camp there?
JG: Oh, we had, played cards and played jokes on one another. HH: What kind of cards would you play?
JG: Mostly cribbage.

 JOHN GALLEY
HH:
JG:
HH:
HH:
JG:
Oh, you played a lot of cribbage. Did all the fellows play cribbage?
Yeah, I won that board there in the tournament we had in
'17.
You're kidding. Gee, that board there, it's a beautiful board, I didn't know it was that old, that it went back that far.
Well, I can't think of any other special questions that
I wanted to ask you. Can you think of anything else?
In hauling out the concentrates there was times in the spring when the road from the mill up this way and on out to Placerville was impassable because there was no gravel. It was a dirt road. They got so the roads would bog down here first because this was lower. In the wintertime they would move the ore up to Naturita, they had a garage there for the trucks and they would store the sack concentrates in Naturita. Just had them piled outside in canvas bags, and by the way, that's the way the ore was shipped to the mill, in canvas bags. There
would be three sacks to a burro.
About what would each sack weigh?
Oh, right around 90 to 100 pounds. And then from Naturita after the road began to get a little better, the snow was off, they would move them up to Redvale, store them up there. Then they would bring the freight in as far as
HH: JG:

 JOHN GALLEY
they could. In fact, when they could get to Naturita they would bring it into Naturita and then the team would take it from there on. And then they had to go to Redvale, they'd bring it to Redvale and store it there and the teams would bring it up. And then when the roads got so they could wade through why they'd clean up Redvale and bring all the freight through. That was a job keeping
HH:
JG:
HH:
JG:
track of--one time there we had twenty eight, we was just beginning to have trucks and there was one time we had twenty eight trucks and teams on the road.
Running at a time. That's a large number of teams.
And I had to keep track of them, where each outfit was every night.
You would expect that if they left Naturita in the morning that they would reach what?
Either in Redvale or Norwood that night. By that night then when the roads got good and they had these faster trucks, they'd go out there and back before the team could get anywheres near the--kept a fellow on the jack keeping track of them.
Well, again, Mr. Galley, I want to thank you an awful lot for spending the time with us. And again, thank you for letting us borrow the pictures and make some copies and we just hope that everything goes well for you in the
next years and perhaps when we get back in the area I'll 8
HH:

 JOHN GALLEY
sure try to come over and say hello. I'd like to talk to you again sometime.
JG: I'd like to see you sometime.
