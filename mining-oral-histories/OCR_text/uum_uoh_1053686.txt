 THE FOLLOWING I S AN INTERVIEW WITH EVERETT BLACKBURN, CONDUCTED BY HARRY HENSLICK, AT PLACERVILLE, COLORADO ON JULY 29, 1970.
Okay, Mr. Blackburn I think the best way to start will be to ask you how you first became interested in the mining industry and about what year that was.
That was in 1940 when I first started working in vanadium-uranium.
And where were you working at the time?
I was working up here at Fall Creek at that time. I had been working up on Mount Wilson with a single jack and the mines started here this winter so I just started to work here that winter.
I see. What have you done prior to 1940 in the way of employment?
Oh, since '33 I¥ve been mining and gold and silver
mostly.
thirties?
EB: No, not too successful but it was better than--I was
leasing most of the time and it was better than working
for wages.
HH: I see and where was that? EB: On Wilson Peak.
HH: At Wilson Peak right, so then in 194O you got into
HH:
EB:
HH: EB:
HH:
EB:
HH:
EB: Yeah.
HH: Had that been pretty successful during the rough
In gold and silver?

 EVERETT BLACKBURN vanadium?
EB: HH:
EB: HH: EB: HH; EB: HH: EB: HH:
EB: HH: EB:
HH:
Well now I've been in ever since. 'Till I got hurt. What was the--you can sit back if you want it picks up fine, don't worry about it. So what were your first leases then or your first mines that you worked in in
1940?
At Fall Creek.
At Fall Creek and were you leasing?
No, I wasn't leasing, I worked for wages up there. Who were you working for?
I was working for Vanadium Corporation of America.
Oh, for VCA?
Yeah, VCA.
And did you keep that relationship up for a number of years--
Like thirteen days would make fourteen years.
That's a long time.
Yeah, I was anywhere from mucker to a mine superintendent. I went from here over to the Netherlands and the tungsten work for a year and then I cam back went to work in the vanadium-uranium.
What time did . you come back and begin back into the
vanadium-uranium?
EB: I come back in I think it was in '53.
HH: And what position did you hold when you came back, what
2

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
job did you start with?
EB: I just went around helping done the development board mostly.
HH: EB:
HH: EB: HH: EB:
HH:
EB: HH: EB:
You did development work.
Yeah, and assessment work and things like that for quite a while and then I went to the reservation.
You were down on the Navajo Reservation?
Yeah, for about two and a half years.
And what did you do down there?
I was, well I guess you'd call it mine foreman down there and all over the reservation.
Did you have Monument Mine Number Two under your direction?
I sure did.
That was a big one wasn't it.
I was the one that put it up to twelve hundred tons a day.
You did?
HH:
EB Yeah.
HH: And you were there for about two or three years?
EB: Two and a half years Monument Number Two and I was over
then I checked with each place you know, but then
interpreters.
HH: What was it like working on the reservation trying to
oversee the entire operation.

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
EB:
HH:
EB: HH: EB: HH:
EB: HH:
EB: HH: EB: HH:
EB:
It's all right if you get the Indians to like you, if you get them against you better stay away from them. It's good I had good luck with them.
You did. How many white men did you have working with you or for you down on the reservation?
I have, let me see, two I guess.
Just two?
Course all the ore haulers were the white boys.
And about how many Navajos would you have working for you at one time now?
I had about a seven hundred at one time.
About seven hundred. That's a lot of miners. How many did you have working up at Monument Number Two when you were working full force then?
About two hundred.
Two hundred in a one mine.
Yeah.
Was that hard to organize and keep your hand on with that large of number and--
It was on account of the Navajos, the Navajo Mountain was
coming in bootleg you know when payday was and that's
pretty hard to a control them when they get drunk.
HH: I see, you mean Navajos from Navajo Mountain would come
down to Monument Number Two?
EB: Well a few Navajos of Mountain Navajos there, were
4

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
working and the r est of them were coming i n there when bootleg comes see.
HH: I see.
EB: And begin drinking.
HH: And then it would be a pretty wild time.
EB: Yes, it was, quite a few time it's pretty well only one
time when they take their checks down there and interpreter told me, he says, "You better stay tonight," he says, "You might as well be in," and about eleven o'clock that night they, the Navajos starting drinking and they come up and decided they wanted to put us up all there in the cabins you know, and I was just sitting there and put my old gun and I told them I said, "The first Navajo steps through there is going to get shot," and that stopped them.
HH: And they did, they weren't so drunk that they didn't think the bullet wasn't going to hurt them?
EB: I would have killed them too if they would have stepped through cause they had about oh, seventy five of them on the warpath, you know.
HH: How often was payday?
EB: Every two weeks.
HH: About every fourteen days, something like that. EB: Yeah.
HH: When that happened a would they bring lots of women too? 5

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
EB: No, not too much.
HH: Basically was bunch of fellows drinking and a spending
their money. Why wouldn't they go back to their homes on
payday?
EB: Well, most of them having the hogans right there. They
stayed right there in Monument Number Two, see, they had
their little hogans and tents. You know how they lived. HH: So they would have their families there?
EB: Yeah, they had their families there.
HH: A majority of your workers would live at the mines,
wherever it was on the--
EB: A majority of them did, yes. Some of them didn't live too
far away and drive back and forth but most of them just
lived right there close all the time.
HH: They have six day work week at that time did they?
EB: Yeah, six day work week.
HH: Off on Sunday. These two hundred men that we said in
round figures working at Monument Number Two was that on the one eight hour shift or was that on the twenty four hour basis?
EB: Twenty-four hour basis.
HH: So you had approximately a third of these men in the mine
or working in it all the time.
EB: Well, most everything was open down there. HH: I understand that it was.
6

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
EB:
HH:
EB:
HH: EB:
HH:
EB: HH:
And there's, some of them were running machinery, some of them drilling, and some of them mucking, you know, and just everything.
A you had a really a large operation when you consider you had not only the Monument Number Two but the other leases.
I had the Cove and the East Reservation and the West Reservation and Monument Three.
Was Monument One, was it working at that time?
Monument One was working a little bit at that time, not too much, they had good ore there in Two. We just concentrated on that and started putting that out.
I saw a, we spent the last couple of days up and down on the old VCA mill there, what's left of it at Foote Minerals.
Did you see Bob Anderson?
Yes, I've been talking to him but we spend one day, four hours down in the records of VCA and one thing that was interesting that I saw was a sketch made for the lease on Monument Number Two, and it was right at the time, within a month or two of the time, that VCA won or got that lease. Now it that time they showed the lease for Monument Number Two though consisting of only 2.87 acres
or something very similar and very small on acreage.
EB: And then many miles taken, I figure they finally got
7

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
twenty acres out of the outfit.
HH: Over a period of time? And do you know or have any idea how that progressed or when it finally became it larger amount?
EB: Oh, well I was there in a '48, '49, part of '50 and then when I was there he already got that much of it.
HH: And I imagine that you pretty much used the entire twenty acres there.
EB: Oh yeah, oh a little bit of it.
HH: Why do you think it was such a small lease to begin with? EB: Oh, the Navajos, is funny people. They're people, Window
Rock didn't want to lease too much at a time then they'd work it out where you had to take a Navajo in with you each time but after that, after we got rid of that, you know, it was all right then.
HH: I see.
EB: We just got straight leases then; I think it was a ten
percent royalty.
HH: Was it ten or was it possibly fifteen, do you know, do
you remember?
EB: No, it wasn't that much; it was ten I think.
HH: You think it was ten.
EB: Yeah, I seen the contracts and read them but I never--
' don't think it was over ten and some of it was, I know some of the leases were around five percent royalty too.

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
HH:
EB:
HH: EB: HH:
EB:
HH: EB:
HH:
EB:
I see. Why was it that the Navajo working on the reservation during the late forties and into the fifties received so much of a lower pay scale than the Navajo working off the reservation or a white man?
That's your government, they added a pay scale set at fifty cents an hour when I was down there and they wouldn't let you pay over.
On the reservation.
On the reservation.
I understand that off the reservation the Navajo would get an equal pay with the other miners.
That's right, that's very true, but while he's on the reservation they offer them fifty cents an hour.
Was that the government or was that the tribal council? It was the tribal council and the government together I think.
I wonder why the tribal council would have a desire to see the Navajo on the reservation not earn a comparable
wage to others doing the same job.
Well, that was started when the white man run about five dollars an hour, or five dollars a shift or something like that, you know.
HH: Yeah, and it, it never changed.
EB: It never changed, yeah it never changed for them.
HH: Is there still a similar condition existing on the
9

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
reservation, do you know?
EB: I don't know.
HH: Course there's not much mining on the reservation today,
is there?
EB: Not too much no, not 1ike it was when the VCA was
running. See, I put out enough ore there to, we were stock piled at Durango all the time. See tree Macey was putting out, oh around a little over hundred tons a day mine over five hundred tons a day and he said, East Reservation about forty five hundred tons a day the West Reservation about forty hundred tons a day.
HH: So you have supervision over seven or eight hundred ton per day production on the reservation?
EB: Yeah, that's right.
HH: That's a tremendous amount of mining coming out of there. EB: Well, I tell you it sure does keep you going.
HH: I'11 bet it did keep you going. Did you operate--you
couldn't of operated out of here. EB: No, I was stationed at Cortez. HH: You were in Cortez?
EB: Yeah.
HH: EB: HH: EB:
Did you have close supervision by Denny at that time? Oh yes.
Did he a ever once in awhile be down on the reservation? Yeah, or if I asked him to come well he said, "Do as you
10

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
think you want to," he says, "I'll be down there as soon as I can," but maybe he'd be there in a week, maybe he'd be there in two or three days you know.
HH: Who did you replace as a superintendent or a supervisor of this area for VCA? Do you remember?
EB: Oh, let's see, I know him but I can't recall his name now.
HH: Maybe we'll think of it later, if you think of it we just might put it in so we'll have it later. I would appreciate it, so you--
EB: ---?--- so take my place.
HH: Were about two and a half years now, why did you move on? EB: I had a dust pneumonia.
HH: Dust pneumonia, what's that?
EB: It's the reservation is so dusty and everything you know,
that it gets dust pneumonia so I have to call it dust pneumonia. You get so much dust in your lungs that and then you have the cold weather and they call it dust pneumonia.
HH: Did you have any of that from being down in the mines? EB: No, just travelling around most of the time.
HH: How would you handle where you were going drift to or
whatever in the other mines, would you make the decisions
yourself as to where you were going to go next? EB: Mostly, mostly I would.
11

   EVERETT BLACKBURN
HH: And then how would you make sure that this was done?
EB: Oh, I have a shifter in each mine and then an interpreter
in each mine.
HH: In each mine you have an interpreter and he did other
duties the rest of the time.
EB: Yeah, yes he did. When his own had about twenty-five men,
something like that in the mine, you know the interpreter
did.
HH: What would he be doing if you weren't at Monument Number
Two? What would he be doing, interpreting?
EB: Well, he interpreted my American shifter.
HH: I see, you have a white man there?
EB: At Monument, yeah, a white man at Monument and a white
man at East Reservation.
HH: Who were they, do you remember, or were the same three
people throughout your period?
EB: No, they changed several times.
HH: Was there anyone, do you know of any one white man that
EB: HH:
worked an extended period of time on the reservation at Monument Two, or--?
I know several of them but they're all dead now.
But they're all gone, I see. That wouldn't do me too much good. Did you ever have any trouble with the Navajos as,
within themselves having a strike? Did you have any of that happen at the mines generally?
12

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
EB: No, not too much.
HH:
EB:
HH:
EB:
Frosty said something about he had to be careful that you didn't get the different clans together.
Yeah, there's a little trouble that a way and not very much. You pretty well straightened that out; it was just put your foot down on the start of it, you know.
I see, you never had to do any transferring of employees, miners.
No, I'll tell you what I did have to do though quite a
few times, after a Navajos works about two or three weeks he gets kind of lazy. You just fire him, termination and lay him off for the week and then just let them sit a long time, and then he'll come begging you for a job again and he's a pretty good man for a month or two then. Until he has some money again and then he kind of feels that he doesn't have to work. I guess this has something to do with the different culture trying to put in to a wage hourly job.
And the Navajo Mountain Navajos was worse than any of them. They had a dollar in their pockets they thought they was rich.
Mr. Binder, when I spoke to him he said that when he went into the reservation as a superintendent that he did not
have any control or anything to do with Monument Number Two. Why did they separate the two at that time, do you
HH:
EB:
HH:
13

 EVERETT BLACKBURN know?
EB: Well, I don't know exactly what it was, I think it's just too much for them to handle.
HH: Who did they put in control then of Monument Two?
EB: Oh let me see, I can't think of his name right now, but
he's dead now too.
HH: Well again maybe we'll think of that too, well Monument
Number Two the fellow that replaced you. Mr. Binder also spoke of--I got the impression from talking to him that rather than having an interpreter at several of the mines there's leases, that there was a female squaw that spoke very fluent English that acted as his interpreter, do you know, did you know that woman?
EB: No, I didn't know her. I didn't know her. HH: I believe her last name---?---
EB: ---?---
HH: But I don't know her first name. He couldn't remember,
but he sounded as if rather than being able to have someone that he could communicate with at each one he was--he almost would have to take an interpreter along
with him.
EB: He might of done that. I understand that he did do that
a lot, but I had my interpreter left in charge you know, when I was gone. He'd see if they done something, they didn't loaf around. They like it.
14

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
HH: Was this a problem if you weren't careful? How often
would you get back to every lease?
EB: Oh, I try to get to every one of them two or three times
a week.
HH: Two or three times a week.
EB: Sometimes I'd go to Monument and then come back in the
night you know, and talk to an interpreter and th i ngs
right away.
HH: So it kept you going around the clock.
EB: Yes it did. Part near at all the time.
HH: Well I can't think of any more particular questions about
the reservation.
EB: And then when I got off the reservation I got kind of
healed up and everything.
HH: How long were you ill with your pneumonia?
EB: Oh it was about two weeks. I went to the Netherlands and
worked in the tungsten and then for about two years. HH: For VCA?
EB: Yeah, for VCA.
HH: What position did you hold over there?
EB: When I went over I was just a timberman and then when we
got started up I was mine foreman. I went there with the understanding I was going to be a mine foreman when I went over, see. I went over as timberman.
HH: Once you became foreman there, how did your pay 15

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
correspond to a what you had been receiving when you worked on the reservation?
It was about the same.
It was about the same. How big of operation did you end up with at any time there?
Oh not too big, just about the time we got a good operation the government taken a subsidy off of it and then we couldn't operate.
And closed it back down.
And closed it back down, yeah.
Since that time then what did you do after that?
I went to work. It was in '54 I guess, I went to work for Jack Turner and he's a promoter and I worked for him for about a year, I guess. Then he transferred me over to the Hogle Brothers, which is Lakeside Monarch. And then they joined it into--merged into a company which is Micheal Copper and then taking over the company.
You said this Jack Turner was a promoter. What do you mean by that?
EB: Well, he was, he was a guy that was putting things together all the time--putting companies together.
HH: Was he going public on them?
EB: Yeah.
HH: And what were you doing for him?
EB: I was mine foreman for him. 16
EB: HH:
EB:
HH: EB: HH: EB:
HH:

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
HH: Oh. He had some mines open.
EB: HH:
EB:
HH:
EB:
HH: EB: HH:
EB:
Oh yeah.
Oh, I thought perhaps you were out filing claims or something of that type.
Oh, rare few claims got filed when you're working for Jack. Most of the time I was going through the mines and getting an operation and then we started mining all the time.
Were these generally a pretty small claims or were there a couple of them were a good size producing mines.
There was several of them pretty good size producing mines. The one that merged with Atlas must of been pretty good stuff.
Do you remember the name of any of those claims?
No, I don't. I can't remember any of them.
And so for this period then you were not associated with VCA?
No, I never said that I spent nearly fourteen yeas with them and then I went to Micro Copper and I worked with them for about oh, I'd say for about four years. Let me see, from '55 to '59. Then that's when I got hurt in '59 and then I stopped my mining career.
HH: You weren't working for VCA at the time you had your accident?
EB: No, no I was working for Micro Copper.
17

  EVERETT BLACKBURN
HH: And where did that occur?
EB: About nine miles below the Uravan on Mount Macey.
HH: What were you doing?
EB: I was a mine foreman and general manager for them.
HH: How did the accident occur?
EB: Well, it was all my fault. There was a board laying on
this, they were building a dam and a board laying on this floor board and I started to walk out and there was a rock under and it turned on me and I fell. It fell twenty-nine feet and lit on my feet on solid rock and both legs went out from under me and broke both and then turned over and fell nine feet and on my head.
HH: It didn't hurt your head though?
EB: It fractured my skull but--
HH: I was just kidding.
EB: They told me if I had lit on my head I wouldn't have to
wear braces.
HH: Well, I don't know that first might have been a pretty
long fall on your head. How long were you in a--?
EB: I was in the hospital part near five months and I was
unconscious seventy-six days.
HH: After that and it's a long time convalescence, did you
get any compensation for that?
EB: Yeah, I'm still getting compensation for that.
HH: I see, and then you look back and you know that it was a
18

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
silly mistake that you made.
EB:
But I just was working so doggone hard and everything you know all the time, and many hours, maybe I'd been in Red Canyon, Utah at six o'clock at night and drive over here, you know. That was a days' drive, drive wide open at two or three o'clock in the morning. I would try to go someplace the next morning at seven o'clock.
What kind of thoughts were going through your mind during the time of the civil suit was being fought in the court with, against VCA and Union Carbide?
Oh, I didn't have much to do with that, I don't know.
It didn't really bother you at all.
No, Denny take care of all that.
Yes, have some very interesting material on that court down in the files. I could sit there and read it for hours but I had other things to do. What is your opinion as far as the conduct of VCA, as far as you knew?
I think as long as Denny Viles had control of it, it was a good company and when he retired, she went to pieces
HH:
EB: HH: EB: HH:
EB:
pretty fast.
HH: When did he retire?
EB: He retired in, I don't know, I think in '57. I'm not
sure.
HH: You know another interesting thing, this happened during
the time you were actively engaged in the industry. How 19

   EVERETT BLACKBURN
did the Union Mines ever draw up a survey of known reserves in 1943 and show only twenty-two hundred tons on the Plateau?
EB:
HH:
EB:
HH: EB:
HH:
I don't know how that was computed. Mostly on paper, I guess.
Because the Monument Number Two I understand had enough ore showing on top to double that.
Yeah, it did. Oh and after I got hurt I'd taken a lease on VCA out there in Bowl Canyon and we worked on that for about a year, a year and a half and I didn't make no big money or anything like that, but I made wages.
How many did you have working the mine?
I had the lease and then I leased it to another folk and I got the check and everything and that way I paid him but in '46, '47 up here in Fall Creek I leased it and I
made sixty-seven thousand dollars to it on my part. Very, very good you pulled out a lot of ore out of there. What, that reminds me of something else. Course I guess there's ah, I know in every mine there's good ore and other that doesn't assay as high but in general about what kind of ore were you pulling out of the Monument?
EB: Oh, most of it was around twenty-five to thirty hundredths of uranium and one to a two and a half vanadium.
HH: Up to about two and a half vanadium. 20

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
EB: And in Monument and while I was in Monument I had one
truck, just a little Chevy truck, it's a single axle just haul high grade; that's all they done is haul high grade at the mill.
Why would you separate that high grade out?
Well, the Navajos liked to separate it and I didn't pay - --?--- any use in, didn't do so I just hauled it into mill another wise they'd hit one of those trees or something they'd call us.
And yet at the mill I don't believe they were trying to reach any other ore at that time or anything of that sort.
No, they wasn't.
And since your accident, have you continued to do some leasing?
Oh, that's when I was in Bowl Canyon, but since then I haven't done much of anything. I've been fooling with my own claims up here in the gold and silver.
the vanadium-uranium country.
HH: Are you keeping those current?
EB: Yeah, and I got, I think it's a thirty-four patented
HH: EB:
HH:
EB: HH:
EB:
HH:
EB: In vanadium, uranium, you mean?
HH: Well, in either.
EB: I got about two hundred and fifty in the lower country in
I see, how many claims have you got filed?
21

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
claims up here on Wilson.
HH: There are all patented up here; you haven't gotten any patented claims down in the lower country.
EB: No, not in the lower country.
HH: Are you mostly in the Utah or Colorado?
EB: Mostly in Colorado, altogether in Colorado.
HH: Oh, you don't have any claims in Utah?
EB: No, I don't.
HH: I see. What do you think is going to happen to the
vanadium industry in the near future?
EB: Well, the way it looks like it's going to come out of it. HH: You think it's going to pick up?
EB: Yeah, I wished that somebody started another mill down
here in Naturita, though. HH: Why is that?
EB: Well, we'd have another mill in there to sell ore to. Union Carbide just puts their own price on everything.
HH: They're just the only purchaser.
EB: Yeah, they're the only purchasers at all.
HH: You know what they paying in vanadium today? EB: I think it's thirty-six cents, I'm not sure. HH: And it has to be above what, 1.5?
EB: 1.5 or something like that.
HH: Something like that. What do you think the chances are of
getting another mill in the country? I've heard several 22

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
miners and men interested in industry say similar things.
EB: Well, I don't know what the chance is but I know that two outfits can do it fairly easy, Foote Minerals and Climax. They go together they part near control this country.
HH: You think they have to go together to do that, though? EB: Yeah, either one of them can do it by themselves, but they go together they burn up for gold and oil wells, out
in this country.
HH: Why isn't Carbide out actively prospecting today?
EB: Well, they've done part near everything that's any good
right now.
HH: They're not using any of their own reserves, are they
basically?
EB: No, they're buying a whole lot of their own stuff and
they got two leases going but their leasers are real bad. HH: Wouldn't it be a pretty expensive venture to get, to
build another mill in that area? EB: No, it wouldn't.
HH: It wouldn't.
EB: No, it wouldn't ever.
HH: Why do you say that?
EB: If they take it and build for about five hundred tons a
day. You suppose it would be expensive for me or you or something like that but to them big companies it doesn't
23

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
hurt them to build them cause they have the control over them. They tell them before they start to build it enough to know what they was doing, you know.
HH: I see. Course it comes to mind to me when you talk about possibility of another mill, of a--
EB: We got to have another m ill.
HH: Climax or someone coming in and help get together, would
that ease the burden on an independent miner at all?
EB: It sure would, it'd ease the burden on him.
HH: How would it do that?
EB: Well, we'd have two different places to go see, and then
they get, it's 1ike when VCA was running and Union Carbide when VCA would get a little hard with a customer, he'd go to Union Carbide and Union Carbide get a little harder with a customer he'd come to VCA, see.
HH: As far as the price was concerned apparently there was an awful a lot of manipulation because the price that they were paying stayed the same.
EB: Yeah, there's a lot, a lot of changes made and different home tonnage or something, you know, make a pretty good price on it.
HH: Do you think the independent miner has a future on the Plateau?
EB: Not unless he gets another m ill.
HH: Do you think with another mill it would be possible for
24

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
an independent to stay alive?
EB: Yeah, on this vanadium, not the way it's going now though. See, they want vanadium very badly; they was going to take the uranium out and take that, that's a byproduct now.
HH: How much are they paying for the uranium?
EB: I don't know just exactly but it's two something, two dollars and forty-six cents, I think at the dealer price
on the--that's after it's already processed and things, you know. I think they're paying around on vanadium now thirty-six, thirty-eight, maybe forty cents more, I don't know, I haven't been in the business at all. I don't know what's going on now.
HH: Another large expense problem for the independent miner today is compared with a few years ago is the higher safety standards.
EB: Yeah. That's right.
HH: This make it very expensive for a small mine to stay
open.
EB: And it makes it very expensive to own, ain't many of them
can stay open unless they have a good mine.
HH: So this is a further burden on that independent miner? EB: Yes, but if you get another company like some other
besides Union Carbide they would take that; put the plans and everything with it for the independent miner, you
25

 EVERETT BLACKBURN know.
HH: EB: HH:
EB: HH:
EB:
HH:
EB:
HH:
Does Carbide do that on some of their own?
Oh yeah, they do that on some of their own leases.
I imagine that fellow got that lease is paying for one way or another.
Oh yes, he's paying for it--dearly.
I'd-- a very big question in my mind how the independent miners can stay alive and yet everyone seems to agree except perhaps the large companies that the best thing
for the industry is to have those independents going. Yeah, you got to have those independent miners or your bosses would be under allotments all the time, you know. You get like the Union Carbide they got backlogs for so much anyhow and that's their basis.
I see. If the industry stayed slower or slowed up where it is today, can you continue to hold your leases for a considerable time, do you feel?
No, I won't be able to. It would cost me too much for assessment work.
Simply assessment work on that number of claims would be very--
EB: They have to do like Union Carbide and all the other companies, I'd have to cheat a little bit.
HH: In Colorado what is the assessment work has to be done? EB: A hundred dollars a claim.

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
HH:
EB: HH:
And is there, are there specifics as to what type of work has to be done?
No, you can build roads, or you can--
Someone suggested to me that today in Utah, as in the past, it could be most anything and it would be hard to prove that you haven't gone out and thrown rock off the
road for four days or whatever it might be, but that in Colorado there was a something about a shaft has to be dropped.
It's supposed to be ten, ten foot assessment, it's suppose to be like you drive a four by seven exposed rock, ten feet on it, that's what you figure a hundred dollars worth but most of the boys just put it up in surveying and road work and things.
So you can still use it and in things like that.
Yeah, and hillsides and things like that and we can still use it though.
About how much in reserves have you got drilled out and marked out?
Not very much, no, just mighty little.
Now are your mines, the claims that you have are they
high in vanadium or are they high in uranium? Oh yeah, they're pretty high in vanadium. They're vanadium claims.
EB:
HH: EB:
HH:
EB: HH:
EB:
HH:
EB: They lay in Bowl Canyon, on Long Park. I got a hundred
27

  EVERETT BLACKBURN
and twenty out at Long Park. I got about sixty-eight in Bowl Canyon and the rest of them over in Death Valley.
HH: And you held those for a number of years now.
EB: No, this is the bunch that I got a hold of very recently,
last three or four years.
HH: Oh, you did, so you're looking for the industry to move
and
EB: I was, for awhile but now the way government is acting,
I don't think it will cause, there's--
RH: The federal government.
EB: Yeah, they're going to turn loose so much of their stuff,
you know.
HH: Some of their stockpile.
EB: Some of their stockpile and they only turn loose,
stockpile and it will never be very good out here.
HH: Apparently the uranium discoveries that have been made and you hear about these large ore bodies in Wyoming, but
apparently that's not a vanadium ore, is that correct? EB: Some of it is, some of it is vanadium.
HH: Are they doing some vanadium up there at this time?
EB: Yeah, some vanadium. Most of it is just uranium around
here, but in New Mexico, well, they just have vanadium
too.
HH: Isn't an awful lot of those claims, the material is so
much easier to get to and they have such large bodies as
28

 EVERETT BLACKBURN
compared to so many of the mines on the Plateau, isn't that going to affect--?
EB: Badly, some it's a lot--part near exhausted. That's going to break the country pretty bad.
HH: I see.
EB: But these little miners can get by on three or four, five
thousand a month, you know. Trying to keep their self going. Keep this up a going, you got to keep them going or this country is going to go to pieces fast.
HH: Yeah, if it should slump it might go that way.
EB: Yeah.
HH: How did you get to know DeVar Shumway, what do you know
o f DeV ar?
EB: I don't know too much of him, but I, when I was
superintendent for these different companies, you know, heck, you meet all kinds of people and everybody in the business giving them leases and talking to them and you go to them for advice and you go to them for things like that.
HH: You just met DeVar on that basis, basically, I see. Okay, Mr. Blackburn, I can't think of any other specific question I'd like to ask. Perhaps I can come back and talk to you again.
EB: Oh yeah.
HH: All right, thank you very much.

       EVERETT BLACKBURN EB: Anytime.
