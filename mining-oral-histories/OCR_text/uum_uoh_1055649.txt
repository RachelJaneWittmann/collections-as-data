 THIS IS MITCH HADDAD INTERVIEWING MR. DANIEL BERMAN IN HIS OFFICE IN SALT LAKE CITY IN THE KEARNS BUILDING ON JUL Y 2 6 , 1 9 7 0 AT 1 0 : 3 0 IN THE MORNING, FOR THE CAL-ST A TE FULLERTON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT.
MH: Mr. Berman, as I said in the pre-interview, the first thing I'd like to know is a little bit about yourself.
DB: My name is Daniel L. Berman. I'm thirty-five years old. I'm a lawyer. I'm admitted to practice in both the states of New York and Utah. I graduated from Williams College and Columbia Law School. I got out of Columbia in 1959. I worked for a year with the law firm of Chadbourn, Parke, Whiteside, and Wolfe in New York City. In 1960 I came out to Utah to teach at the University of Utah Law School. I taught there for a
couple of years, and then came downtown where one of the jobs I undertook was to be a lawclerk for Willis W. Ritter, Chief Judge for the United States District Court for Utah. Following my clerkship for Judge Ritter, I became associated with Joseph L. Alioto of San Francisco. While I practiced law here, I also had my own offices. For about the next seven years I
worked for A lioto.
MH: Now during this time, what has been your experience
with mining law pertaining to, say, uranium?
DB: I really had none. I do primarily anti-trust litigation which certainly is my background. The only

 DANIEL BERMAN /11
contact that I've had with the uranium industry was when I was with Chadbourn. Chadbourn represented the V.C.A. in the vanadium litigation that centered around V.C.A. and Union Carbide's conduct in the Colorado Plateau. Then, when I came out here, of course, I was Judge Ritter's law clerk at a time when the Niseley Case was finally settled. Then, of course, I worked for Alioto. ---?--- ---?--- ---?--- But I knew some of the actors. I was actually with Chadbourn when the Niseley was tried here in Salt Lake.
MH: When dealing with a case, say, of either class action or of such a magnitude of anti-trust litigation, what was one of the prime legal problems which was facing?
DB: Well, of course, this is going back--I'm doing this from memory now--I haven't read the Niseley Case for some time--but the primary problems in Niseley was
that at the time it was a new class-action theory. Of course, without any class action, there wouldn't have been any practical substance to the litigation. There were a couple of major claimants, but the bulk, the real exposure to going in, was sustaining the class action. Of course, the great legal victory involved was sustained in the class action. It was, to my knowledge at least, the first time that a class
2

 DANIEL BERMAN /11
action had really been successfully litigated in an anti-trust case in this country. I could be wrong about that, but it was certainly one of the first. Is it fair to say, then, that the Niseley versus Union Carbide Case acts as a precedent toward class action?
DB: Well, not the United states versus Union Carbide. Of course, that was the government case.
MH: No, Niseley versus Union Carbide.
DB: Yes, but the Niseley Case was a major precedent for
class-action litigation. Indeed the forerunner of the revised rules for class actions that are in existence, are now being used commonly in anti-trust litigation; also other litigation in this country.
MH: You say revised rules; how did they change?
DB: I can't remember the exact details, but one of the problems in Niseley was that from the defendants' point of view, they had great exposure to numerous plaintiffs who probably weren't going to be bound adversely by the judgments. That was the problem: the problem of forming a class, getting notices to the
class, bringing the class in, having them bound by the judgments, having it litigated, and what action. It is, of course, a major thing. Now, let me say that in a little more detail because, perhaps, you don't understand. I may be assuming too much. In an anti-
3

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
trust case, in consumer litigation, what you're doing is, you may have, say, in antibiotics, a broad spectrum of people who have been hurt in an overcharged conspiracy, who as a practical matter could never receive redress because they couldn't afford the cost of litigation presenting their claims. What the class action really does is to take a lot of people who otherwise would never have a day in court and make it practical for them to have it.
MH: This is what they did when the made advertisements in the newspaper. They say if you belong to a certain class, you are eligible for that decision?
DB: That's right. It took a tremendous amount of time and effort, which was spend in ascertaining the class then paying the money out to the class.
MH: Is it true to say, though, that a class action does depend on the fact that a legal decision has to be handed down prior to that class action, stating that some wrong has bee committed, so they can establish the class action?
DB: No, you bring an action in behalf of named plaintiffs. You bring the action both individually and representatively for the class. The court is going to make a determination of what the appropriate
legal standards are. If the class action is met, the 4

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
common things--that is, are you dealing with a common violation? Is the class likely to be fairly represented by the people who are in effect the named people? Are there going to be predominantly common question in the litigation as opposed to individual situations? Are the class too numerous to be represented individually? I mean, it's a practical type of thing that you're looking at; the fairness of the defendants, the fairness to the member of the class; making a judgment is practically whether this
is the way to conduct a litigation. If the rules are quite clear--you can look at Rule Twenty-three. Three has been a lot of litigation. It's an area that's forming at the time, and how successful it's going to be, what it means in terms of lawyers' traditional roles, is a real question. But there are two ongoing areas in litigation these days, anti-trust litigation and securities litigation. Class action is going to
become one of the major tools.
MH: You said that class action and litigation change the
lawyers' traditional role. It changes in the fact that he is now representing maybe thirty, forty, fifty people under the auspices of one case, correct?
DB: Well the numbers can be much greater than that. Chances are, the lawyer won't even know them, and
5

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
really, you're dealing with lawyer-oriented litigation.
MH: So it's primarily sometimes a settlement more than actually a case?
DB: No, it's not a question of settlement. Historically, litigation is the plaintiff who's got a gripe, wants to have that gripe contested in court, and makes an arrangement with a lawyer to represent him. You've got a live body in there who's the client. I'm not
trying to say that's always the case, but that was the trend. In class actions, particularly in the securities area, you named plaintiffs are figureheads. The beef in the litigation are the lawyers.
MH: Niseley was one type of case. But taking it from another one, you stated that you had some contact with V.C.A. and from the company angle of it, more or less.
DB: Yes.
MH: When you deal with a corporation the size of Vanadium
Corporation of America, what was their point of view when this type of class action was brought against them?
DB: Well, I don't want in any way to imply that I played the key role of all time in that litigation. I do
6

 DANIEL BERMAN /11
recall that there was a case brought out in San Francisco by Mr. Alioto's office on behalf of a company called Continental Ore, that went to the Supreme Court; I helped write the brief in the Ninth Circuit in that case. That was my primary association with that case. I didn't confer with the client. I was a junior member of the firm doing research in this case. I was trying to come up with a theory, which we came up with, also which was successful in the Ninth Circuit at the time. That was independent of some obvious errors. What had happened was the judge and Continental Ore--Judge Vought (?) from Oklahoma had given what we now call in the trade a Clours (?)instruction.That means in order for the
jury to find for the plaintiff, they would have determined that the anti-trust violation existed, and not only that it existed and affected the plaintiff, but also that it had an impact on the public. There was public injury. There was the public injury qualification. Well, in between the time he gave that instruction and trial, there was some appropriate objection. ---?--- There was no question that there was going to be a reversal, except that we argued that the reversal wasn't prejudicial because independently the defendant was entitled to directed
7

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
verdict. That's what the theory of the Ninth Circuit bought in that case. V.C.A., as a reaction, I'm sure, though it was terrible. All that exposure, nobody really bringing the lawsuit. Of course, they had been successful in the government cases. Niseley was the first time they lost. Then when they lost, they lost big.
MH: Yes. I'm curious as to the effect of, as you say, public exposure, public reaction to companies.
DB: I don't think they were concerned with it.
MH: They were too big then, to really have--
DB: I wouldn't say they were too big. These cases--
Niseley was litigated in 1959. The crux of the stuff went back to 1938, as I recall, and it continued on through the war, indeed until the advent of uranium when the A.E.C. got a hold of it. Actually what happened--this may show my great historical inaccuracy--is that uranium is really a late come, especially in importance. They were interested in vanadium, which was an alloy that was very helpful in
making certain types of steel, particularly armaments. This was over that litigation which was almost two decades old at that point. Now, public impact can have a tremendous importance to a company with regard to current litigation. I mean, ask the
8

 DANIEL BERMAN #1
electrical companies or the truck companies how they feel about anti-trust litigation. I think that at the time that the Niseley case was being litigated, they weren't concerned about public relation. They were concerned about money. Well, you got to sell a lot of products to make three and a half--I don't know, what
it was--five million dollar judge--
MH: Five million dollar suit.
DB: Judgment. The settlement was three and a quarter
million dollars worth in the case.
MH: I have a question. This is actua11y anti-trust
litigation. When you're with companies or products or sums of money that are this large, when you go into the anti-trust litigation case, what are the actual things you're going against, aside from the Sherman Anti-trust Act? Are there certain sections or public laws of Utah or of the United States, that you're going against?
DB: No. Anti-trust litigation, historically, involved three sections of the anti-trust laws in terms of violation. That's Sections One and Two of the Sherman
Act, and Section Two-A of the Robinson-Patman Act. Now there are other sections that are used. Now you've got questions about whether Section Seven of
the Clayton Act is going to be a significant 9

  DANIEL BERMAN 111
plaintiff's tool. It clearly is with regard to some questions of corporate control. But in the money cases, that is, "You did it to me, and you owe me for what you did," it's basically Sections One and Two of the Sherman Act and price discrimination provisions of the Robinson-Patman.
MH: You mentioned Section Seven of the Clayton Act. This is one that was many times brought up in regards to uranium cases. Is this the concept of price-fixing or
unfair market?
DB: No. Section Seven is the prohibitions of corporate
acquisitions. Now, Section One of the Sherman Act applies to corporate acquisitions, but it's a much different standard. Basically as I recall the theory in Niseley, these people combined to control the production and the purchase of production in the
plateau so as to rig the price on it.
MH: Well, this is what--
DB: This is what they did; they monopolized it.
MH: So it was a violation of Section One, then, of the
Sherman Anti-Trust Act?
DB: No. The Tenth Circuit held that the facts violated
Section One and Two of the Sherman Act, so basically,
no one has really ever sat down and thought out the
elemental distinctions between the two acts but
10
'

 DANIEL BERMAN /11
they're actually two fold. One is in Section Two of the Sherman Act. You can have unilateral violation, that is, you don't have to have two or more parties
in a conspiracy or a combination. And that was one of the holdings of Niseley. The jury found them guilty of both the attempt to monopolize and the monopolization provisions of Section Two. Those were sustained by the Tenth Circuit. The combinations and conspiracy distinctions had to do with whether there was specific intent to monopolize, which means to suppress and eliminate competition or prices. If you look at the broad business conduct in this, which was just basically buying up production and the people who could use the production. There was some very friendly arrangements between V.C.A. and Union Carbide to lend color to the whole thing.
MH: You mean, kind of like patting-on-the-back type of thing?
DB: That's right. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. It seems to me that it related not only to the United States, but also outside of the United States. I can't remember, but I think that's true. I have a
question. You stated that you were a clerk for Judge Ritter, who was the man who handed down the decision. During this period, how was the court itself affected
11

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
by anti-trust litigation of this nature? It was uncommon for Utah to ever have a case of this size.
DB: That's not true.
MH: Isn't it?
DB: No, that's not true. First of all, you've got to
understand when I clerked for the judge, it would be the early spring of 1962 to the spring of 1963. I was there when Niseley was settled. I was his law clerk when he had to approve the settlement because it was a settlement of the class action. But it had passed. Utah has always had more anti-trust litigation and
more experienced anti-trust litigators for the size of the district than any other district in the country. That was primarily because Alioto got his start up here. He was successful in Utah with some motion picture litigation early on in the game. And so there was a lot of motion picture litigation. He handled the case--got a million dollar judgment for a company called Fischer brewery against Lucky Lager, which was a major Robinson-Patman recovery. There have been substantial anti-trust litigation in this district. Ritter at that time probably had as much experience as a trial judge for anti-trust cases as anybody .in the country. Well, it depends. Some guys may think he was a fine judge--I do--some of the
12

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
other people may not. But he certainly is an experienced federal judge.
So before this case had come up then, he had-- Substantial experience.
MH: DB: MH: DB: MH:
DB:
In anti-trust.
You bet.
You mentioned the case of Alioto and the movie company. Wasn't the firm Twentieth Century Fox that he--?
Well, you're talking about the Village Theaters Case. That was litigated. But there were other cases before that. That was an aftermath. That was one of the smaller cases. I'm going back to the grandfather cases, when the old Lawrence Theater chain sued all the Paramount dependents. That case either went to the jury or settled before it went to the jury--went to trial.
MH: This was about the thirties?
DB: No. This was all Second World War, after the Second
World War litigation.
MH: Second World War. So then it was Alioto who really
was the "Master" around here as you put it?
DB: Yes. Ritter was appointed, I think, by Truman in 1948 or 1949 and it was after that. That was true all over
the country. But before the Paramount Case came down. 13

 DANIEL BERMAN /11
The Sherman Act was passed in 1890, so in the first sixty years, forty-eight years, fifty-eight years of anti-trust litigation, there was almost no anti-trust litigation in this country. That's understandable without the federal rules, without the opportunities to go in and find out from the defendant what they were doing. There was no way that you were ever going to get evidence. Niseley as an example would be one, a little bit to the contrary. In Niseley you had a
guy who confessed, which was Burwell. Burwell was the key in the Niseley case. If you believe Burwell, there was no question that these guys violated the law, but he was there. He ran the Colorado Plateau for Union Carbide.
MH: Burwell?
DB: Yes.
MH: I was also told that Howard Balsley was extremely
influential in it, too.
DB: Balsley was a miner, though.
MH: Right. But he had a lot of records for your side.
DB: Yes, Burwell was the defendant's employee who came
over and testified .as to what was going on. He testified for the government in Denver, for the plaintiff in Continental Ore, and for the plaintiff in Niseley. With his testimony, there was never any
14

 DANIEL BERMAN /11
question that these cases weren't merely circumstantial cases.
MH: They were pretty well briefed and well evidenced, as well.
DB: Well, again, it was a question of whether Burwell was telling the truth. Well, the reason I bring that up is because you don't usually find anti-trust violations where you have somebody sitting in the hotel rooms, and say "Okay, I'11 tell you what's happened." If you don't have a chance to go in and really have at him, dig around, then it's just like what you're doing now. It would be pretty hard to write the history, I guess, without going and talking to the people and finding out what they did anyway.
MH: Going into the uranium industry itself, or any mineral industry which is subject to such a boom, as uranium did, as you say, it was a late comer. It came at a time when they had a lot of other pressures on the uranium industry besides, just being used for radioactivity. There was the fear of the bomb and lot of public thing going on with uranium as well. Do you think the government actually had a fear of having
this industry monopolized by private companies? Is
this one reason that they wanted--?
DB: You're asking a person that's really uninformed. Now
15

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
what I'm going to say is a guess. My judgment is that the government could have cared less in the Second World War. They wanted somebody who they could work with, who could ge them what they wanted and administer it. That's what they did with Union Carbide. In Continental Ore, one of the defenses was that these guys were acting on behalf of the United States government.
MH: This is the question that I have.
DB: So I don't think the government gave a hell of a lot
of thought about it. They just wanted to get the job
done.
MH: So then you think it was more or less, the government
needed a commodity. They would get it possibly anyway
that they could.
DB: I don't know. They key fact that you would want to
know is, when the government is on a---?---. You'd want to know when the Justice Department began their investigation of the vanadium industry. My father was with the Department as head of the patents and cartels section. This again is a pure guess on my part, but they had, as you may know, some international cartel litigation involving metals.
There was every indication ---?--- and G.E. and a couple of other people were playing hanky-panky. Now
16

 DAN I EL BERMAN 11 1
whether the vanadium litigation arose out of that type of enquiry or when i t was pending on the books , how it got into it, that you'd have to f ind out . Independently of that, I think the Atomic Energy Commission could have cared less.
MH: It's interesting because of their control. This is the question that I had. They're like in ther e , especially with the concept of the patent, and I think probably came up in Niseley several times. These men actually did have free title to the land. They were selling the ore in good faith more or less to these different mills. That's somehow the impression you get from reading the briefs of the
case, or that they felt duped. But I have another question. You mentioned, that there are other areas of anti-trust today that are coming into vogue as far as legal precedents. Is there a correlation between what happened in early anti-trust litigation and what's happening now.
DB: Well, I think that's obvious. You're dealing with statutes for one thing. And you're dealing with statutory philosophy that's basically Populist philosophy that puts competitive behavior at the top
of the social values that ought to be protected economically in this country. You know there are a
17

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
lot of people who question that in academic circles, but legally we don't. So the correlation has been very great. The thing you've got to remember is that anti-trust regulation, more than any other body of law that I know of, is litigation oriented. It only
matters what happens in the courtroom. The concepts are significant, but it's the factual development of those concepts, it's the use of them factually in an industry that's meaningful. That depends on the lawsuit.
MH: So 90 percent of the time, the case can be clear cut, but it's how it's handled in the courtroom--
DB: Well, it's not clear cut, but it depends on how the case is handled in the courtroom, how it's developed, how it's sold. How much information you can get. You just don't start with the truth. You've got to work to find that. You're a historian. You know that.
MH: Right. Now it would seem that anti-trust litigation especially there would be several obstacles in obtaining --what--the prime meat evidence, or often times that which you need. What are the tools that are available to an anti-trust lawyer or to his
researchers?
DB: The big tools, of course, are the discovery tools.
You can put a guy under oath, you can take his
18

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
testimony, and you can ask him questions. Now if he's truthful and he's got a good memory, that's excellent. Of course, you got to do that. Records. People have a penchant for putting little thing in writing. You must get people that don't destroy documents. One good little document that goes back,
just like that camera sitting there, it's a snapshot. Not of what some guy say's afterwards when he's faced with a lawsuit or he's trying to justify what he did, but what he was thinking at the tim.e You get that kind of a little picture. You're on your way. Generally you're not going to find the guys in the
hotel room with the transcripts of what happened. That's a little too much to expect. So the picture's not that good. But it is a picture that will be inconsistent with the justification that's being advanced explaining the behavior that's going on. The other thing is just the accumulation through records, interrogatories, and depositions of the financial way which people behave. For instance, if you're fixing prices, you don't know what happens in the hotel rooms, that's something that people can forget about, or you may never find out about, but you sure know what the prices are. Somebody somewhere has to put an
invoice out.
19

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
MH: Right. As well as their yearly reports.
DB: That's right. That's the sort of things you're
looking at. There are some things that have to show up. It's a question of whether economically they indicate that there's a fix on it. You get the economists to give you all sorts of fancy arguments as to whether it indicates that there's a fix on it or it doesn't. It's all fine and good to say in theory that uniform stable pricing could be accounted
for by other things than an conspiracy. But in fact, as a matter of practicality, people generally make the system work a little better than it would be getting together on those telephones.
MH: Right. But in any corporation, and in the government there are certain regulatory agencies that require annual, biannual, or quarterly reports dealing, with what that particular industry company is going.
DB: Yes, but there is no periodic, anti-trust reporting system set up, or accountability system set up for the government. It would be totally meaningless if there was. You got to remember one thing--maybe I
ought not to say this. We're getting way off the subject. People in an industry, just go out to the Colorado Plateau--as an example, those miners deal with a system. That's their livelihood. Year after
20

 DANI EL BERMAN 111
year they work in a system that ' s established. Now not everybody questions that system. They get used to it. They live with it. In the fi nal analysis , they believe that they're doing it is the way it should be done. You can deal with a man in bus i ness who violates the law all the time and he genuinely in his own mind may not understand that he is doing it because he may say, "Oh, I'm not sitting down in the room. We' re not reaching an agreement." If there's a 1itt 1e prob1em in there , I may see the guy and say , "Gee, what's the problem?" and complain about it a little bit, or say, "Gosh, it looks like our production capacity is going to be---?--- this year and we need that." He may think, that is purely innocent. If you hold it up to a mirror and say, well why do you do that? Why do you need that kind of information? Do you act on it? Is that important to you? What would happen if you couldn't have gotten
this information? I can't emphasize that enough. Businessmen aren't anti-trust lawyers. And they will do things sometimes for years without honestly believing they are violating the law.
MH: The concept of a vacuum economy. They're in a particular environment, they're going about the i r business, they're doing it and they don't really have
21

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
to stop and look at it. Or they don't take the time to.
DB: Well, they don't. For instance, I can give you an example. There's an industry, the petroleum industry where four or five years ago these people used to call each other on the phone all the time to get the
detailed pricing structure. One company will give his pricing structure to another competitor, they can get the same pricing structure for them and they base pricing decisions on that information. The constant exchange of information. They honestly believe that
they are being competitive.
MH: There was just a recent decision handed down
regarding that, wasn't there?
DB: That's continued (?) corporation, that's correct.
What's the difference if you and I have the same motivation to maintain a stable market. We do so through constant exchange of communication of our pricing information on the most current basis? We make every effort to keep it current. I'11 1et you know what's going on, and you let me know what's going on. I know you'll use the information. You know I'll use the information. Soon you sit down and say, "Hey, let's charge the same price." It doesn't make
any difference. The job gets done. 22

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
MH: Yes.
DB: That's the language used. It's a question of the job
that gets finished.
MH: You stated that often times these men aren't anti-
trust lawyers. Going back to the "Master", as you once stated, or the "Grandfather" of anti-trust lawyers, what is it that really sets apart an anti- trust lawyer or a litigation lawyer?
DB: Well, in Alioto's case, what you're asking about he's the best I've ever seen. It's not that he's a good lawyer, he's a very able man, he's an extremely intelligent man, or a hard-working guy. He is not the
most careful legal craftsman in the world. I don't think he'd take offense like that. He's fully capable of being that if he wants to, but he's never found it necessary. His great ability is his ability to present information to laymen in a way that's persuasive; to take a very complex, factual setting, make it believable, understandable and persuasive. He does that better in the courtroom than any man I've
ever seen in my life.
MH: This is actually what he probably did in Niseley.
DB: No question about it.
MH: Because I was going to draw a question from this.
Many of the people involved in that particular case 23

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
and in any anti-trust case, often they are not really the corporate heads, are they?
DB: The lawyers involved in that case were Joe Archer, representing Union Carbide--
MH: Is he here in Salt Lake still?
DB: No, he's in the Morrison--the name escapes me at the
moment. He's a lawyer--a senior partner in a firm in San Francisco, young and still practicing. Joe must be in his early fifties or late forties. Joe Holland with Holland and Hart in Denver I'm sure has a very good understanding of the case; Ed Near (?) or the Chadbourn office who is now U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District Number One; Cal Bailey was a local counsel for Union Carbide, I think; and I don't know who was local counsel for V. C. A. It may have been Dennis McCarthy, but I'm not sure about that. The Alioto law office. I suspect--I don't know this for a fact--but I suspect that these same lawyers were the same lawyers in both Niseley and Continental Ore. I think Holland was probably V.C.A.'s lawyer in Denver. I think that's how he got into it. I don't know about
Archer.
MH: So it was common at this time for certain lawyers to
be known in their field and handle anti-trust litigation.
24

 DANIEL BERMAN /11
DB: They still are.
MH: Yes this is what I'm getting at.
DB: Archer's a good defense lawyer from San Francisco and
experienced. Holland and I haven't run into. Archer I've run into, but Holland I don't know. He's still active in day-by-day litigation. He may be. I just haven't run into him.
MH: Litigation is a field that, as far as the legal aspects of the uranium mining industry, it is vitally important. It is exactly like you say. I wonder if sometimes these men didn't seek to settle their differences in the courtrooms rather than turn to violence, as I guess they easily could have when Niseley came up as well. They have legitimate beefs.
DB: Well, I don't know about that. Violence isn't removed from the mining industry of this state. A couple of years ago Anaconda and a bunch of wild catters got into a hell of a spat down in Delta on the Bayou(?).
They had Pinkerton. They were throwing guys off of property and people were shooting at each other. A regular range war.
MH: So there's no totally removed sanction, in regards to mining (?) .
DB: W ell, I think, again, you' re got to remember that when Niseley got to the courts, it was over. It was
25

 DANIEL BERMAN 111 done.
MH: There was a long time in getting there.
DB: Yes. If you go through the records of the class action, you go and visit these guys, these old men. It was a nice thing to have happened to them later in 1ife when they were all interested in it. But they had lived their lives. It was just something that had
been fought out.
MH: Just some more on the economic question. With an
industry such as uranium or the vanadium-radium ending per se up in the uranium industry, how has this affected the economic structure of the Colorado Plateau here? That's an economist's question?
DB: Yes. I'd have to know a lot more about that.
MH: I was wondering because it was so important that anti-trust suits were brought against it. A lot of people must have had their lives staked on the
uranium industry?
DB: Yes. Probably if the concepts of the Sherman Act were
fully administered in detail so that, they were just informally and consistently applied and made the work in every instance, we'd have to review our economic policy in this country to bring in at least balancing factors that the law doesn't recognize now. What you're really doing with the anti-trust laws is that
26

 DANIEL BERMAN #1
you're sort of playing cops and robbers with businessmen and the periphery. If their behavior gets egregious, the consequences can be severe. I mean nobody pays out six hundred million dollars, as they do in electrical cases, and does not stop and think about how the game ought to be played--the same in antibiotics. You don't have to divest your stock in General Motors. They get special legislation without thinking about your acquisition policy. El Paso has been litigating their acquisition of Pacáific Northwest since '57--that's thirteen years, and they've been ordered to divest. I mean it's going to be very costly; it's the kind of thing that a business man understands. I don't think the criminal sanctions frankly have had much impact. I mean nobody really goes to jail except in rare cases. It's a fifty thousand dollar fine. That's not much. But the
civil penalties, the civil remedies both equitable in terms of divestiture. Take the motion picture industry, it just redid the motion picture industry in this country. No question about that. It's been a total failure in the petroleum industry, but that's because the cases failed, not because the theory failed. I think it has some practical everyday-gut impact. I have been practicing anti-trust litigation
27

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
consistently now for seven or eight years. I've never had a case representing a client where I've caught anybody in a hotel room. Not only have I recovered a lot of money for competitors, but day by day, you help people out. You get the game played fair. You get somebody like a pet food distributer, some woman had a pet food distributorship whose supplier was going to cut her off. Well, he wasn't doing it right. She had him cold turkey. Well, it wouldn't have been worth a lawsuit, but she's still a distributor. I had a little service station operator out here in the Basin who just had the worst type of coercion. The
guy was putting on, and had himself canned by his company. Now, again, I'm sure this just scratched the surface in terms of what's going on. But the surface is there, it's capable of being scratched, and it's very expensive. I think it has an ameliorating effect. It probably has as much to do with the game being played fairly as anything in the country. There's nothing like putting the chief executive officer from a major corporation under oath, and saying, "What's your name?" It's a very democratic
experience.
MH: You are stating that anti-trust litigation is a
powerful as far as the courts are concerned? 28

 DANIEL BERMAN /11
DB:
Not only as far as the courts, but as far as the country's concerned. Now maybe it can be made more effective. Maybe there will be more vigorous enforcement. But you want to believe that men in major companies understand the laws exist.
You mentioned Galbraith before. It seems to be going back to a theory which he developed, which states the economy is only as good as those people which can constantly look at it and evaluate it.
I want to be clear. I don't know enough to really judge Mr. Galbraith's theory. I'm sure that in perspective without accepting his thesis literally, there are a great many of his perceptions that are true and useful. But Mr. Galbraith's an economist,
he's a theorist, he looks at the overall picture. I look at people who are on the stand in a specific lawsuit; people fighting about money for a--specific goal. It just seems to me that I've seen it accomplished enough and seen enough concrete results that I believe it's a practical influence and
MH:
DB:
motivating force in people's lives that I don't see. MH: So it really doesn't matter whether you're there or
not? It's--
DB: It's the fact that if you have to pay thirty-five
thousand dollars for a single service station 29

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
violation you got to sell a lot of gas. If you got to pay seventy-five thousand dollars for a single service station violation you got to sell a lot of gas. If you got to pay seventy-five thousand dollars for a single theater violation, you got to sell a lot of popcorn. You just do. That's just the money that you pay out, it's not a question of the legal fees. It's very expensive. So what I'm trying to say is, it's not perfect. It doesn't live up to its theoretical pretenses, but it's of substantial impact, and it makes a difference. People act and influence their business judgments on the fact that
laws exist and they have a closure. It's not a dead
letter. It's not for fun.
MH: You think if the anti-trust laws were stiffened what
would that have a tendency to do?
DB: If I had my way about stiffening any provision of the
anti-trust law, I'd increase the imposition of jail
sentences for hard-core violations.
MH: Make it so you could actually put the guys who are in
it--
DB: You can now. But take the guy who's sitting in a room
and fixing prices, and that occurs, and he's with a responsible major company. He knows it's against the law, and his company knows it's against the law. Then
30

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
they have a great public relations program about conforming with the law, yet his company either tactfully or encouragingly asks him to participate in that sort of stuff. That type of thing, after all, corporations are just people. Somebody ought to bear the responsibility. That's a crime. It is a crime. That's robbery on a mass scale.
MH: Historically there have been times when captains of industry or the magnates of industry type theory, there have been times when people would make a statement like, "You can't put the president of X
Company in jail." They actually meant it, that you really couldn't get away with really getting to these people in their corporation because--
DB: I don't think that's true. By and large, I want to tell you, that having had all this exposure, I think that most businessmen and most top corporate executives are extremely decent and extremely responsible people, who have big jobs and lots of problems. They're not Machiavellian shysters, running
around duping the public. That's not what happens. But there are times when it does. If a guy--a kid can go to jail for pushing dope or stealing a car or breaking in, or robbing a bank, why that's peanuts. These people know what they're doing! They know
31

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
they're violating the law out of greed to make money. I'm not talking about technical violations or just circumstantial violations. I'm talking about the people sitting in there, saying, "Okay, it's our big when the phase of the moon--" you know, price fixing on children's library books. That's pretty rough. Antibiotics; holding back smog devices from an area just smothered in pollution; that's pretty rough stuff--if it's true.
MH: Going back a couple of years to the time when this happened with V.C.A. there really was a different legal--the case action came after the boom in essence. There had really been anti-trust litigation before, but when you have a settlement of this size, it's going to make anybody stop and think, right?
DB: I'm sure it would. I don't know the final impact that this case had on the plateau. I suspect that the change in demand for the products produced by the plateau had a greater impact when uranium became the primary product. It was not only the primary product,
but the way it was processed was different. The potential of hauling it was different. It was a higher grade ore. It was a more renumerative ore. All these sort of things may have given the producer, the small miner, much greater independence in terms of
32

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
dealing with the manufacturers. All those things could have had a far greater impact.
MH: I have kind of one final hypothetical question. This deals with the thing that is going on right now in the Colorado Plateau, this thing the lawyers refer to as the "shell game", or the revitalization of old corporation.
MH: Right. They are sometimes revitalized by large companies today. As an anti-trust lawyer, do you see it still possible for the same situation to ever exist here on the Colorado Plateau?
DB: I don't see that the "shell game" has anything to do with it, my answer is probably no.
DB: What would happen and what would change is that you might get a different set of circumstances if the methods of production required tremendous capital
investment, which they didn't in the old days of the plateau. Very small mining operations get under way and make some ferro-vanadium, or some vanadium ores, and they'd be in business. But suppose that in order to operate successfully, you had to acquire huge
capital investments, you may get economically the
same situation, but for different reasons.
MH: So then in essence, anti-trust litigation of this sort comes down to each side defending more or less
33

 DANIEL BERMAN 111
its own type of action. You have to deal with both sides in--
DB: I'm sure that Union Carbide and V.C.A. may have legitimately though that what they were doing was trying to stabilize and develop an industry that would have got to pot without them. Of course, what they did was just rape the small miners.
MH: But yet they really weren't--they really could not be really held guilty by virtue of their motive. They were guilty by virtue of their deeds then, correct?
DB: What is motive when you're dealing with---?--- then, correct?
DB: What is motive when you're dealing with ---?--- version. I don't think there was somebody in V. C. A. or Union Carbide that said, "We're going to get these miners", but there was somebody there that was saying, "By God, we're going to take conscious and deliberate action to control this market". And they did that.
MH: So it is pretty peripheral, just as you say, no matter how many controls you have, you can never really get inside of a total corporate economic scene?
DB: Well, that's a question that you'll have to go talk to somebody else about!
