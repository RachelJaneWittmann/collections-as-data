 T H E F O L L O W I N G I S T A P E T WO O F A N I N T E R V I E W W I T H D A N I E L MEYER, CONDUCTED BY MITCH HADDAD AT THE KEARNS BUILDING, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH ON JULY 28, 1970.
MH: This is probably a bit more recent. But I was wondering, you were stating, you know, that the government or the administration is seeking or is in essence really making things a lot harder than they really have to be. Also going on with that, you come to the question of leases. Since this is a very-- especially with, as you say, patents becoming harder and harder to get, leasing of public lands. Now what type of problem does this present to the miner or to people seeking to make mineral claims?
DM: Well, I think that's a mistake. I think that the idea of the man that makes the discovery owning the land is valid. Because it give us the ancillary benefits of his further development and of his family's development. You know, when you own a piece of land, that's the hope of every man. But I was up here in Alaska and I found two teachers, both were college professors, husband and wife. Very, very brilliant. They moved up and they took the most horrible little piece of land down on the Canine Peninsula and they
were homesteading it. I said, "Why, for heaven's sakes?" And they said, "Because here the air is pure. And we're just tired of our kids being near dope. And we're in school, in the academic area, and we find

 DANIEL MEYER #2
out it isn't as pure as everyone thinks it is. We're teaching our kids with mass mediocrity. We put our money in some books. We're going to educate our own children. We're not even putting them in school!" And they're growing up on their own little piece of land.
It's a beautiful thought. We all need that piece of land. We all need that something we call our own. You take Russia. They have had tremendous trouble putting out their crops and they were against the capitalistic system, but the minute they allowed some of the farmers to have that little old twenty foot square patch, it was very productive and they
produced vegetables beautifully. That patch was theirs and you put that extra love into and that extra midnight effort. And that's what does it! And if you don't own it, you're not going to take care of it. It's just a simple as that. The best example you can find right now--we're all on a leasing binge. Go down and lease a car from Hertz áor Avis or any of them. That car will have four thousand miles on it, and it will be a beat up, rattly old mess. Why? The guy who rented it didn't give a damn for it. And I know, I used to own a rent-a-car company. By golly, the people just abuse it horribly. But you don't do that to your own car. And the same is true. You take
2

 DANIEL MEYER #2
the people up in Harlem or in our---?--- ghettoes, I just absolutely--it bothers me. We don't have anything like a ghetto in America. A ghetto is a walled city where people are enslaved, and we don't have that here. Slums are made by slummy people. But those people don't give a damn because it's not theirs. It's not theirs. I spent a lot of time with youth sports activities. I donate a lot of money to
it and I've president of the little league in this area and things of this nature, and the area I have has very fine homes and it has the very poorest in the city. And I'm always trying to devise new games whereby the poor people can earn new shoes to
maintain their dignity. We don't give anything out. They all earn them. And they win the games. You phony it up a little bit, but you do it so they can maintain their integrity and their dignity. But it's real funny to me. The parents of these kids without the shoes come in with a car, a nice car. I never had a car when we were kids. I didn't have a car when we were married. I was married six years before I could afford an automobile. And right now every kid's got cars, right? Every kid. It's not a necessity, it's a luxury. It's a necessity virtually. Well, I even did
without those things. But those people that can¥t 3

 DANIEL MEYER #2
even afford shoes for their kids, they still have cars. They're smoking two, three packs of cigarettes a day. They're doing .all those little things, which
if they pooled all that money could buy that house. And I know, I've gone through this bit. I know I bought a house when I couldn't afford to buy one. And I scrimped and I saved and I gave up everything. I gave up wheels, I gave up smoking, I gave up everything. It meant a lot to me to own something, to put my family in something I owned. And it was beautiful and clean and lovely. But you need pride. You need pride. And you're not going to have pride in something you rent. And the leasing of land is simply the rental. Now I can live with it because I lease lands, oil lands all the time. And I can live with it. And I believe in the Multiple-use doctrine. But I do not believe it is the optimum use of the land. I believe the optimum use would be to let the man own that and then let the company lease the land from him, and he owns it. And then it becomes a producer of revenue and it becomes a place where you can grow
and develop.
MH: You mean a royalties-type situation where actually
the company is--
DM: Well, I own fee lands out in Uintah Basin, for
4

 DANIEL MEYER #2
example, and Gulf Oil is leasing the land from me. But I own the land and I take care of the land. It is mine. The government does very little. If government takes care of it, you got to pay someone to take care of it. And it uses tax dollars instead of producing tax dollars. These people who are taking care of it, the government administrators, are not owners. They don't really give a damn. They go home at five o'clock. An owner doesn't go home at five o'clock. He works his land. So you have a different philosophy of care. But is the leasing system okay? Yes, it's okay, because I'm not going to change it. I'm not going to change it. We¥ve embarked upon a phony philosophy that the land in Utah belongs to the New Jersey butterfly chaser for his own private recreational preserve. And out liberal government has absolutely oriented itself toward that philosophy.
Okay, now we get to a question that I'm sure you have definite opinions on and can shed some real light on. You get to the subject of ecology or conservation or exactly what your New Jersey butterfly chaser, as you say, is out for? And I've noticed before in the course of the conversation that you mentioned
affective ways of preventing pollution. I mean, for example, you mentioned affective ways of preventing
MH:
5

 DANIEL MEYER #2
pollution. I mean, for example, you mentioned West Germany and we've mentioned other examples. How do you really see ecology and the drive toward conserving land? How does it really affect mining and mining law?
Well, nothing happens automatically. It takes someone
to do something. You take your national parks, the Canyonlands. Right now we have no roads into the Canyonlands. And the people are saying, "Don't build roads into the Canyonlands." How did you ever get to the Canyonlands in the first place, except on old oil trails built by the independent guy, the miner? He built the little trail out there. He didn't destroy it, did he? You have good examples in many cases where it has been destroyed through carelessness, but by and large he's done one hell of a job. One hell of a job. He's done a lot better job than the cities have done in protecting the attractiveness of the cities. A lot better job. I don't know. We're all-- we're all interested in preserving the beauty of this tremendous country, and we all have a long way to go. But it comes through pride. You got to care. You got to want to do it. You take a fellow who cares, he's not going to throw his cigarette butts out on the street. And he's not going to throw out his beer can.
DM:
6

 DANIEL MEYER #2
He's going to pick it up. But you don't have in our philosophy right now people that care about our country. You see a lot of condemnation of our country, lot of protest. And I don't think they're protesting because they care, because that type of people often despoil the land. All you got to do is
look at "Woodstock," the movie. These are your protesters, but what they left was a shambles. See, they can talk love and peace, and we care and give you a flower, but they leave the crap on the ground when they leave. So they care. But they don't care enough to be careful. And I think that this is a big problem. We do have to worry about ecology and we do have to worry about our resources and we want to preserve them, and we can do a better job of preserving them. But it takes pride, and I think we
can work together to get to that point.
MH: Okay, Mr. Meyer, as I said, I have a question in regard to the actual place of the small individual miner in the history of both mining law, legally, as well as mining history, because both are really
intermixed when you think of the two.
OM: Well, gosh that's a real great question, too, Mitch.
We, I think, have touched on all phases of that going around the corner on it. But there's no question I
7

 DANIEL MEYER #2
think in anyone's mind that the little fellow, that
independent miner, prospector, if you will, has been responsible for the growth of this country, literally that. He produced the minerals which gave us our West, and the West wouldn't have developed without it. He took the risks. He is the man for whom our mineral laws were developed. Our entire Department of Interior literally was geared to help develop the West. Long before your Oklahoma land rush, long before the days of the sooner, you had the development of Pennsylvania, which was considered the far reaches of the West, and Ohio and Wisconsin. And those were just daring who went out there. And you have to develop a piece of land to understand what the rigors of that are. And you've got to live as I have. And I live comfortably. But I often live along out in the wilds. And you've got the sky for a blanker. And I can't pack a whole flock of material all the time because when I go out I've got to climb the mountain ranges. And I've got to look. And you can't look with the jeep. You can go so far, then you're afoot. You can't pack a tent because you can't carry it physically. So you're on your own. And you pack enough and you get curious, and you run out and you go back or you stay. And then pretty soon you
8

 DANIEL MEYER #2
start to live off the land. And you do some pretty silly things. You'll eat a jack-rabbit. And you learn to set a little snare line. And you learn to cut a pole, and make a fishing pole and get that breakfast. And you' 11 eat a fish cold. And you' 11 do silly things. But you're looking at new places. You're looking at places people may not have ever put their feet before. And you see the petroglyphs from the Indians years and years back and you develop the beauty. I do less and less of that, and it's to my discredit. I really should get back to do more and more of it, but I just don't have but so many hours. But the little independent miner, he's got to be protected because there's no way we're going to become competitive under our system with the large companies only doing the ---?--- because we've had great technology and great progress. But still today the overwhelming majority of all discoveries are made by the little buy. And then, of course, the big guy comes in and he can improve upon the theory. And once it's been shown to him, he can then go on and try that theory on the neighboring land and do it in a very, very large way. But it's very, very seldom he does it without the assistance of that little guy poking under rocks and coming up with an idea, and a
9

 DANIEL MEYER #2
hope, and a dream and then working it. And then it's shattered all of a sudden because he realizes that the end result of all his labor is just not there. I
support I guess fifteen, twenty prospectors out of my office here. I never expect anything in return. I don't have any contracts. I don't have a letter saying I loaned you this. But we'll have people drop in every week, and they're a little hungry, and "Mr. Meyer, sure got a good idea. And sure could use a little food." And so you give them a few dollars. And under the old grubstake law, you get a piece of it. And I got a few people who get a little discovery, but I've never made a claim. That's his. That's his. If his heart bangs enough, I'll get a piece; if it doesn't, I'm not going to sue for it. I don't believe in litigation. I believe everybody loses. But generally, and I say this very sincerely, generally the people in the extractive minerals industry are your last bastion of real fine, solid people. Let me tell you a little story. I had a case here not too long ago where I heard a well was going down and I had a feeling it would be successful. I did a little work on the guy who owned the land. I had found him in Shreveport, Louisiana. I bought the land from him for five dollars an acre. I took a lease. That's on
10

 DANIEL MEYER #2
the telephone! I have a name and I have a voice. I have nothing else. No wires, no letters, no anything. I said, "I'11 pay you five dollars for it and 3 percent overriding royalties." And they said, "Fine. No trouble." There was a little haggling back and
forth. They wanted ten, I offered three, we went to five. The very next day they had a strong oil show up in the hole. Humble Oil called up, people offered them twenty-five dollars an acre, 5 percent royalty. They called me right back and said, "Holy cow, we can get all this from Humble." I said, "Well, you made a deal." And they said, "That's right." I got the lease. I couldn't even have sued on my conversation. Oh, you could sue on anything. I would have lost. And yet they were honest. And you'll find this so much. A handshake is still worth something. And these old prospectors that come in and out of here, I get a handshake. If I put a piece of paper in front of them, I'd scare them to death. And I'd insult their integrity. My Dad's a little bit that way. He doesn't want anything in writing. He wants a handshake. And
he's got the handshake, and he'11 look you in the eye, and he'll grip it, and you'll know you've got a deal as long as he's alive. And I think that little guy is all important. But he's the forgotten man now.
11

 DANIEL MEYER #2
our laws are geared to take care of the big company that makes a good political contribution maybe. I don't know why. Or like the Atomic Energy Commission. The little guy's a promoter, or the little guy's doing something that can't possibly succeed because he doesn't have the wherewithal, he doesn't have the technical knowledge, he doesn't have the seismic
crews, and he doesn't have the very large staffs, so consequently, he won't give Meyer the maps. He'11 make him sweat the hard way for what he gets. And had I had all the information that the Atomic Energy Commission could have offered me, I could have made plenty more discoveries, I'm sure. But you see, you gear things in government to helping some large people. And large people don't always do it as well. And remember, I was with a big company and I think Standard has one of the finest companies in the whole world. I'm very complimentary of them. They spent a great deal of money to develop lands like up in Alaska. But I don't think they're efficient. I think
they react slowly and that's why the little fellow can always beat the big fellow. By the time approval is gained in a big company, and you've got to go to your boss, and he's got to go to his boss, and they've got to go to their boss, pretty soon it goes
12

 DANIEL MEYER #2
to a budget committee. By that time, it's all over. The little guy's already got it tied up. And so the little fellow is necessary. And he'11 continue to develop. But pretty soon it's going to become so onerous that he's not going to matriculate into that field. You have less and less people now. You have less and less small mines which are operational. Fewer and fewer miners are experienced and trained. Now you do things in a big way. Just like your old butcher shops, you know. Now you have meat cutters, you don't have butchers, and you're starting to destroy some of the value of that meat. You're not cutting it as attractively or as intelligently, and you're doing the same thing with the large companies on the public domain. And yet when you get into the big discovery, the . big guy doesn't have the wherewithal. And so the unitization and the development of the area by the big fellow is a blessing. So I'm all for it and I encourage unitization, and as I already told you at the beginning, I'm a target finder. I should do what I can do best, which is find minerals and bring them to the point where the big company can develop them. Then I seek help from the big company because he can do that better than I can. And we should all do what
13

 DANIEL MEYER #2
we can do best. He's better able; he has the dollars and I don't. So we all need each other. But the mining laws must take cognizance of that little
fellow ad start to help him. I despair of the direction we're going. We're going the opposite direction from that, á and pretty soon you' re 1i ttle deposits are going to be spoiled or not found or the big operation is going to develop the only the one major deposit and the ancillary deposits to it are probably going to be your dumps. Go down to Milford right now and you look at the mining down there for copper. You find the ore body now extends right under the dump. It's going to take millions of dollars to remove that overburden that they dumped on there. But the little guy can't do it, and so consequently they have made an economic---?--- large ore body because it wasn't thought out real well. So we got to improve our own house. We have to do things more intelligently. And we can do it and we will do it. I think this is the greatest country in the world, and you can still do anything you're man enough to do, but it's just getting harder. And you have fewer and fewer individualists. You have more people fitting the mold all the time. I want my children to be individualists. I had my daughter writer a letter to
14

 DANIEL MEYER #2
last week's Tribune. She wrote it and I didn't know about it. In her letter she severely criticized U.S. Steel and it's ore ---?--- for throwing out the waste. My son went over to sell hockey tickets to U.S. Steel, and the man asked, "Do you have a sister named Linda Meyer?" My son said yes. And the man said, "She just wrote a severely critical letter about us." All right, now here my family is divided. But I believe my daughter was right. And I admire her for doing what she believed she should do. She is like I am, she believes in causes. So it hurts me in one area and may help me in another. But I think this is beautiful. I think this is what we should be doing. We should be doing what we feel in our hearts is right. And I definitely feel that I've got to spend a lot of my energies without compensation to help that little guy. And a lot of my practice is that way. But I can afford to do it now, so maybe in part I'm giving back a little of what I've taken, or will take, so it has compensations. When I look in that mirror in the morning and feel, well, maybe someday I can help somebody. I think our government
will wake up altogether too late, or course, and by that time we'11 be in such a hodge-podge that we can't go backwards. But I believe we should open up
15

 DANIEL MEYER #2
our lands to homesteading, and I believe we should open up our land and let that poor fellow get out there and have it because he'll take care of it if it's his. And we won't have all of this waste.
MH: So is it the frontier spirit, or the spirit that really made this whole country coming back all over?
DM: Oh, well, it's never left, but it's just becoming tougher. You have the people who want it. They're here. They' re going to the other places. They' re going to the islands, they're going to Alaska, they're going up into Canada. I do a lot of work in Canada, and you'd be surprised how many Americans you see up there who want to just get a little bit further away from it all.
MH: They're rugged individuals.
DM: Yeah, sure. And they're going north. It's a little
tougher. The growing season is a little shorter and the winters are more rigorous, but this is where the land is. You can't get that land here anymore under our patent laws, so you go there. You can see the drive. The people earn doing it, but it's in smaller and smaller numbers. So, Mitch any good that comes
out of your record here could be a godsend because I think people could learn from other people just by this happening. And I think our public land laws need
16

 DANIEL MEYER #2
severe improvement and you have to have a given knowledgeable set of rules than when you do XYZ, then the result is yours. But right now you do it, but then someone else comes along and makes a judgement decision which has nothing to do with XYZ and imposes his own will over you, and the government then deprives the individual of what he has corning. So I hope we get back to basics, and I think we will one day, but it will be too late. And I'm confident. We had a grand and glorious chance with this Public Land Law Review Commission, but when I see some of the recommendations in there, you can see what they're doing. They're placating various local interests groups like the Sierra Club. They do a lot of good incidentally. They do a lot of good. And they are right about some things. But I don't believe we should say that all areas not now developed should be prohibited to any vehicular travel because you're not going to develop those. Those could be your cities of tomorrow. But if you lock them up, where are people going to go? What are they going to do to give vent to their desires to raise a family in cleaner air than in Chicago or Cleveland or any of those places
that I abhor? MH: Or L.A.
17

  DANIEL MEYER #2
DM: Sure, right. Look at L.A. I turned down a transfer to
L.A. because my wife wouldn't--you know the smog is fantastic there. It's a sentence to live there. It's a blessing to live here. You know, I love to breath air I can't see. I think this is a beautiful thing. So if you come up with any other questions, why I'd be real tickled to meet with you any time.
MH: Okay, then there's nothing else you'd like to add?
DM: No, I think I owe you an apology for bending your
ears this much. MH: No.
