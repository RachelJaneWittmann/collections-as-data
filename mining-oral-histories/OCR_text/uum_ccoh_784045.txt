PERHAPS, OTHERS FROM T ANIGUCHI.]
NT: My name is Nancy Taniguchi.
WH: Yes, he was city marshal up there.
NT: Your father was?
WH: Yes.
NT: What was his name?
WH: Steckelmann.
NT: What was his first name?
WH: William.
NT: William Steckelmann. He was the marshal?
WH: Yes. And then later on, why he went on the night shift of
his own choice. And he's also, was also a deputy sheriff
from Carbon County for 33 years.
NT: Well, that's interesting.
WH: And then ...
NT: When was he the marshal in Hiawatha?
WH: We went there in the fall, in September of 1915. And he
retired in 1946.
NT: Gosh, that's a long career.
WH: He was to retire sooner, but then the war came and so
they wanted him to stay on and he said he was too old a man to handle Hiawatha because they were bringing in

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
these Arkies and Okies and some of them were much to be desired [sic] 'cause they'd stand around and argue which penitentiary was the better. (Laughter)
NT: Great bunch.
WH: And he said he would never, at his age, he wouldn't be
able to handle it. And so they asked him to go over to the Moreland Portal(?). And so they built a little house over there for him--a two room house, and it was really nice.
NT: So I take it you were in Hiawatha during World War I, is that right?
WH: Went into...
NT: Went into. And was your dad the marshal then?
WH: He retired just...no, he wasn't, let's see..
NT: Well, when did he go on nightshift?
WH: That's what I'm trying to think. He was on nightshift
around 12 years.
NT: Yes, before he retired?
WH: And he was to retire in 1942, and that's when the war
started. NT: Yes.
WH: And then they wanted him to g? back to city marshal in 1942, but he said he just couldn't...
NT: Sure.
WH: And so then he went up to Moreland Portal as guard.
2

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
NT: Oh, I see. Did, now I'm particularly looking at the early
period in Hiawatha ...
WH: Yes that's what Mrs. Gordon told me.
NT: So, were there any particular problems that your dad had
to handle during World War I, that you know of?
WH: No, not particularly . Now the ... now what was that? It was before United Mine Workers organized, United Workers of the World, the IWWs. They were a fanatic group. And he
had a little problem with them. NT: Oh, really?
WH: And then he did go out on a scouting trip looking for a renegade from Mexico and he ... if I could think of that man's name. He was quite a well known man, but it wasn't the one you read about in history books. And he went helping them look for him and that man was found up in Bingham canyon. And then Wattis was being built, the company had a hard time getting water and so they kept tapping the Hiawatha water supply. And my father would have to go up and shut their water off. And, of course, the people they were mostly... Well, I don't think there were any families at that time in Wattis. And the men were living in tents and, but they were very irate when they came out of the mine and could not bathe. And they made some remarks about my father that wasn't very complimentary. In the first place, my father was German.
3

  WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
NT: Oh, I see.
WH: He came to this country at the age of 21. And he had a
very distinct accent, although you never could get him to admit it. He didn't 'think he did. And so they had the water trouble a lot.
NT: Did they get mad at him because he was German?
WH: No, well, they would make the remark, you know, either the Hun and that sort of thing. But they were mad because he was shutting their water off. But they knew it was his job. You know, and he wasn't just doing it for the fun of
it.
NT: Yes, right. Why don't you tell me about this dedication
at the monument and why did you have, who is this queen?
Why did you have a queen?
WH: Well, they had the       to raise money and she'd sell,
they'd sell votes. And they had dances and things like that and so these girls that were running for queen would sell the tickets. And then for each ticket they sold, they got a vote.
NT: Yes, I see.
WH: And not only that, she was a very popular girl. And her
name is Rakie Gunderson. And then she ... her name now is Mrs. Lloyd Ungerman and she lives in Salt Lake City. But this, I just after you called me, I called Mrs. Garber because her husband was very active in getting the
4

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
monument. And she said that it would have had to have been in the early 1920s. Well, I know it was before 1924 that they dedicated it because my sister was one of her attendants and my sister died when she, in 1924. So it had, in March, so it had in--This was in the summer prior to that time. So somewhere between 1920 and 1924. Besides the dances that they had, they also sold watermelon and cantaloupe. They would buy them wholesale down at Green River and peddle them in Hiawatha.
NT: Who bought them? Who peddled them?
WH: The American Legion sponsored building the monument and
you know, that was their project. And if you go through Utah, you'll see several of them. Mount Pleasant has one, I know. And then up in northern Utah, I saw one one time.
But the American Legions, it was their project throughout the state. Whether it went farther than the state, I don't know.
NT: Yes. Were you in Hiawatha during the strike of 1922? WH: Oh, yes I was.
NT: What do you remember about that?
WH: Hiawatha was fortunate. They did not have the problems
that they had down here. And . the company did move the '
strikers out of town and they had a little camp outside of a tent town right outside of town. But the only problem they had was they had a coal train to go through
5

  WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
and the superintendent of the railroad would not tell the train crew that they had to take that train because they knew that they were irate people in Martin and up that way. And so anyway, the engineer, a man by the name of Webb, said he would run the train if somebody would fire for him. And so Mr. Vaughn, the superintendent , said well he would fire. And then my dad rode the train in the cab. But they went through the tunnel at Martin, and came out of the tunnel, these men were up on the hill. And my dad had looked up there and he said he didn't see anyone up there. Of course, they were behind bushes. And then he looked to the other side to see if there was any on the other side of the track and just then the shots were fired and Mr. Webb was killed.
NT: Oh, no. Was your father hurt?
WH: No, just Mr...Mr. Vaughn wasn't hurt either, just Mr.
Webb. The bullet hit him smack dab in the head and he was killed. And so then Mr. Vaughn had to take the train on in. Well, of course, ,it sat there for a while. But that was the only really bad incident Hiawatha had. But as far as the mines went, they had very little trouble. Even when they took them down to t ? e camp, you know, people didn't argue too much. They were very calm down there. My dad would go down once a day and bring one or two back up so that they could do the shopping for the people in the
6

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
camp. Because in those days... (Break in taping)
WH:
(Later) . .. to the post office to pick up all the mail and he would, they would go to the store and shop. And there would be no incidence while they... Oh, sometimes when they were coming in, because whoever was coming was walking, because my father was on a horse, he did not have a car. Very few did at that time. And, but some of them would razz them, you know. But they just ignored them. But my dad told them that he would not take them into town if they caused any incidents. And then there was one time that one of the ladies got real sick and the doctor would not go down to the camp, but he said if there was some way to get the lady to his office he would see her. And so my dad asked the general superintendent if he wouldn't send a car down to bring her up. And the superintendent said he would if the chauffeur was willing to go. Well, the chauffeur was a real nice guy, too, so he said yes, he would go get her. And so they, my dad rode in the front seat with the shotgun sticking out or a rifle , whatever it was , so people knew he meant business. And but nobody bothered them because you know, if you're sick, you're sick. .And my dad knew that this
lady was desperately sick. In fact, when he came home he
told mother he didn't think she'd live until morning. NT: Oh, gee.
7

  WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
WH: But she did get better, fortunately. But the doctor kept
her there at the hospital. That's the only two really... NT: Yes. Where were you born? What year were you born?
WH: I was born in 1910 in Castle Gate, Utah. See, I'm a
world-traveler .
NT: Boy, you sure are!
WH: I was born in Castle Gate. Spent my childhood in
Hiawatha; my adulthood in Price.
NT: You've certainly been the rounds, haven't you?
WH: My father always sent us to Indiana in the summertime
because he didn't want us to be known as coal-miners'
brats .
NT: Oh really?
WH: Because at that time, coal mining was not, you know, not very respectable. I mean it was a way of life, but to make a living. They were considered the rough and tough, uncultured person.
NT: Who was in Indiana that you went to visit?
WH: My dad's family.
NT: Oh, they were?
WH: That is, his brother. And then he had an uncle that had
a large family there. And    dad always considered Columbus, Indiana,      because that's where he went when he came to this country.
NT: I see. Well what made your father come over here from 8
'

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY Germany?
WH: In the first place, he served his conscription in the German army because everybody had to. And I think they had to serve two years. His father was very much military. And my father was the youngest of six boys and his father had tried desperately to get one boy in the military, at least. And so, and then it got down to my father. And my father left rather than going to become in the military.
NT: Yes. And so his family, or relatives, are already in Indiana?
WH: His mother's brother was in Indiana, in Columbus, Indiana. And his brother was an engineer on the BEO and was living in Greenfield, Indiana. But that was the only two that were here. Then some cousins and that came and
settled around Chicago.
NT: How did your dad get to Carbon County?
WH: Well, he was a... his uncle raised--that's what I get
mixed up on--harness racing horses. And my father was his jockey, or his driver. And so for about five or six years that's all he did, was travel the circuit racing these horses. Do you know what         racing is? It's where they have the little cars?
NT: Yes .
WH: And then he developed asthma, just real bad and the
9

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
doctor in Columbus told Uncle Bill that my dad should go someplace else. And so Uncle Bill had a farm in Thayer, Kansas, where he raised his hay for his horses. And so the doctor thought that would be a good place for my dad. So my dad went there ' and operated this farm and met my mother and married her. And then, let's see they were married in 1903, and I don't remember just ... my second sister was about two years old, I guess, or three, when they came to Utah. I don't remember the date. But anyway, he got sick in Kansas and had to move on. And my mother's folks had come to Utah. My grandmother had become a convert to the church. And my grandfather had heard about the Utah mines and how much better they were than those in Kansas and less dangerous, so he agreed to come to Utah to live. So then my folks came to Utah.
NT: Yes. What was your mother's maiden name? WH: Hampson.
NT: Well her first name, too.
WH: Anna.
NT: Anna Hampson, OK.
WH: And then my father worked in the mines. Oh, I don't think
he worked more than bout six months in the mine and he had a very slight accident, but that was enough for him. And so then the company offered him the job as city marshal at Castle Gate. And so he was city marshal there
10

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
u n til he went to           And the recommendation, the letter that the superintendent at Castle Gate sent to Hiawatha, said that the reason he was leaving their employment was for higher wages. But Utah Fuel could not pay a hundred dollars a month.
Oh, my heavens!
And that was a 24 hour job, seven days a week, you know.
NT :
WH:
NT: That's amazing!
WH: And when my folks went to Hiawatha, we lived in what was
called East Hiawatha. And when we first got there, I used to like to tell the kids that I had spent a night in jail. Because the house we were to get, the post master was moving out of it, because they were moving the post office over to where it is now is--in the same original building, by the way. And they gotten moved in. And so they put us in the... because part of it was the jail and part was the city hall, that building. And they put us there. And so just for the fun of things, my dad would lock us up in the cells, you know. And so we did get moved into that house and it was one of the few modern houses in town. And the bathroom, the water closet, the water chamber, was up against. the ceiling with a chain hanging down. And we were there .. we also had steam heat in that house. We were living high on the hog. And we were there because they were ... decided they had built new
11

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
houses over in what they were referring to as Black Hawk, but it's the center of town, now. And they had decided to modernize the houses after they were built. And some of those houses hadn't been lived in for some time... maybe a year or so. And I think ours was one of them. But anyway, they were putting bathrooms in so then we stayed over in East Hiawatha there until our house was ready. And we moved over into Black Hawk, in about--let's see-- we must have moved in'the spring of 1916, because I spent my sixth, I had my sixth birthday in the new house with the bathroom.
NT: So it was 1915 when you went to Hiawatha from Castle Gate?
WH: Uh huh. And my folks lived in that same house for 34 years.
NT: Where was it in Black Haw? Is it still there?
WH: Yeah, the house is still there. We were on the first row after you carne in under the tipple and around. And at that time the hotel was there. But the rest of it was one big field. And the:r;e was loosh(?) in there because somebody at some time had farmed it a little bit. And there was a little garlic pat.ch, there, I remember the garlic. And then later on, why they built the school
house there. It was a big, red brick schoolhouse. Beautiful schoolhouse. One of ...
12

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
NT: So you were just up the hill from that?
WH: We were right across the street. No hill. Just right
directly across the street.
NT: Oh, uh huh, I know where it is.
WH: And my father put in the first lawn in Hiawatha. And, of
course, also the first fence. And the officials would come down and sit on rocks that he would dig out. He dug that whole yard by hand. And they'd come down at night and sit on the rocks and visit with him and laugh at him, you know. Think, you know, you're not going to grow a lawn. And so he got the lawn planted and it grew that year. And then the next year the company fenced all the other yards. And anyone that wanted to plant a lawn, they would plow it.
NT: Oh, that's nice.
WH: And so then they        ... Hiawatha at one time was
considered the most beautiful mining camp in the United States, because it was big, it was modern, and the mines were modern. And anyway they built the amusement hall in about 1917, I think it was, and it was dedicated when the soldiers came home from World War I. They had the big dedication dance. And it was one of the fanciest affairs that they have ever held in Hiawatha. All the women got formals, real elegant jobs. The wore tux. And then there used to be, farther up the hill, I don't know... Do you
13

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
know where the general superintendent's house is? The big house?
NT: Yes.
WH: Well up in back of that were no houses and there was a
building there called the Gun Club, and that's exactly what it was. It was an indoor shooting range. And then on the outside, on one side of it, the company had built a skating rink for us in the wintertime.
NT: Ice-skating?
WH: Yes.
NT: Oh, how nice.
WH: And then, but I think it was, must have been in about
1923 or 1924, they decided to add on to the amusement hall, and they added that wing that makes the ''T" now. And that was, they had moved the Gun Club down and used that for the framework off it. And there they had the banquet room and then a little kitchen. And then on the other side of the hallway, they had a reading room. And then upstairs they had a room that could be used as a lodge room and the community Sunday School met up there. The LDS people met in the big room. And they boy scouts used the reading room, the         reading room for their place of meeting. And we all got along very well. You know, one... Oh, and then they put in a bowling alley in the basement. And they had a confectionery down there.
14

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
And I used to sit pins in the bowling alley, much to my sister's dismay, because they didn't think that was very
lady-like. And I would go home so dirty, you know, and once in a while I'd go home with a mashed hand. But not too often. And...
NT: How old were you when you were sitting pins?
WH: Well I think I must have started when I was about ten.
NT: WH:
NT: WH: NT: WH:
And I sat them until I went away to school. And when they'd have meets up there, the other bowling teams around, I was always one of the first they'd contracted, because I was a real good setter. I could get those pins up and up on my little stool before the first ball rolled. And you know, bowlers are very impatient. Of course, you wouldn't know that, because your experiences had always been with automatics.
That's true.
But they were very impatient. If you didn't get your pins up fast and sometimes the kids would get the pin up, all their pins up, and then go to slump and they'd knock a pin down and maybe the ball was already going down the alley. And those bowlers would get really upset.
Did they have bowling leagues _in those days?
Yeah. Each...
They did .
...each town had bowling leagues. And another nice thing 15

  WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
about the fuel company, see, they owned, they had mines in, well the mine was called Panther, but the town was Heiner(?). And that was just up above...
NT: Castle Gate.
WH: Up against, between Castle Gate and Helper. And then they
had Moreland. And they had Hiawatha mine and then they had one in West Hiawatha. And they would run excursions, er trains, we had a little jalopy train and one week they1 d run the train to Moreland to pick up the people for the dance. And the next week, why, the train would go from Hiawatha to Moreland. And in the wintertime, they would go over in the bobsleds.
NT: Oh, my goodness.
WH: And the people ... I don,t know what Moreland did ... but
the people in Hiawatha would put, maybe there would be three or four family 'of kids in one house. And then the kids would babysit. Now, I could not stand babysitting, so I wasn,t asked very often except by our neighbor. We had a neighbor that would occasionally would have me because I just hated babysitting. And so anyway, but we always had our Forth of July together and our 24th and they always had a kids, dance for Thanksgiving and Christmas. And the company always gave gifts to the kids. And they weren,t just little picky gifts to the kids. They would bring great big huge sacks of candy and nuts
'
16

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
and apples and oranges. And one year every kid... whose father was working for the company, in any capacity, got a bathrobe and a pair of bedroom shoes. And then one year we got sweaters--heavy sweaters--and toboggans and mittens.
NT: Wow.
WH: The big kids got gloves and the little ones got mittens.
And I think we had, no we didn't get legging with it. But that as the type of gift they would give the kids.
NT: What years were those that that happened? Roughly? How old were you?
WH: Well, from the time I,was five, because we spent my, the year I was five, we were in East Hiawatha for Christmas. And I remember being so excited because Santa Clause had drove up in the sled, you know.
NT: Did he really?
WH: And we didn't know because my folks didn't know that this
was happening. And ...
NT: So they didn't do that in Castle Gate?
WH: No, Castle Gate didn't do it. I don't know of any other
camp that did. Some of them would give candy or something, but no one made the rounds. And, of course, there was some people that had big families. There was one family there that had ten children, well, they got you know . .. But they saw that everybody had enough. And
17

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
then there was one Christmas when they had a terrific snowstorm and there was no trains moving for about a week. And the kids couldn't understand why Santa Clause .. .And it was, I think if I remember correct, it was the day after New Year, and the company had everybody bring their children to the amusement hall. And Santa Claus was there to pass out the treats because he could not get through, he got stuck. He told us where, but we didn't know.
NT: Oh, that's great.
WH: And I don't remember what we got that year, but I'm sure
it was something. One year we all got skates, nice
skates. The little ones got double runners.
NT: Uh huh. Do you remember when they built that nice skating
rink up above the superintendent ' s house?
WH: Well, it was there when we went.
NT: It was? And the Gun Club, too?
WH: Yes.
NT: Did they leave the skating rink up there when they moved
the Gun Club down?
WH: No, because they were putting houses up there. That's the
reason that ... NT: I see.
WH: Now, when I was in the forth grade, they were building the schoolhouse and I went to school up at the Gun Club.
18

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
NT: WH:
Oh, you did?
They had kids scattered all over. And there was the fourth and fifth grades were up there. And then they brought in a portable building that they had bought from Sears and Roebuck. And I think the sixth and seventh grades were in that building. And then there was one year that my oldest sister went to school in a beer joint. Oh, no.
But they just couldn't find... And so, after he closed his business hours, he'd clean up and they would put covers over the bar and the back bar, you know, and the seats up. And then she was there the one year and then the following year, why, then they fixed the basement of the hotel. So that was the eighth grade was in the basement of the hotel.
What year was it that she was in the beer joint?
L et's see. She graduated in ... she must have been there
in about 1920.
So they must have, the miners must have really been working good that year--in '20, to have that many kids, right?
I would assume so. It was ri9ht after the war and see they were booming during the war.
Right.
And it could have, it's possible that it could have been
NT: WH:
NT: WH:
NT:
WH:
NT: WH:
19

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
in 1919. Perhaps it' was. Because she graduated from Carbon High School in 1922.
I see. Well then when she got old enough to go to Carbon High School, how did they get the kids in from Hiawatha? They had dormitories down here.
She lived in the dormitory. They had two, one of them... Where Jean Selmy's store used to be and then there's that vacant lot over to the next street where the boys dorm was on that lot. And the girls dorm was around the corner, facing the other street. And the kids from all the camps, Sunnyside and Kennilworth and Hiawatha and, not Moreland, because Moreland's Emery County. But they were all in the dorms.
NT: I see. Did you ever have to do that?
NT:
WH: WH:
WH:
NT:
WH:
I went to Wasatch Academy because they weren't busing the kids and...
END OF S I D E ONE
And you said also that you had some pictures of Moreland?
Of the tipple? (break in taping)
The company provided one horse and then my father bought it from them because it was such a good kids' horse. And we just adored Gram. And then this, the company provided this horse but it was strictly for my father's use. And then they had some other horses that they used when they official would come and they had to go to West Hiawatha
20

   WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
or a range, you know.
NT: This was before they had the cars, I guess?
WH: They had one or two cars, that was all. The company had a limousine or a fancy car, like the Afferson H, do you
ever hear that?
NT: No. And then everybody else had to use horses to get
around?
WH: They walked .
NT: They walked . But not your dad?
WH: They used, well, my father had too much territory to
cover, see, because he had to go up to the mountains if there was trouble with the water and he had to check the reservoirs, the city of Hiawatha water, they would run it down the reservoirs, and he had to check those to make sure there wasn't dead animals floating around and stuff.
NT: Oh, yeah.
WH: Or that they weren't leaking. And then he'd have to go to
Moreland.
NT: Who else had a horse ,besides your father?
WH: The doctor.
NT: Oh. And that's all?
WH: The doctor did have a little car, took a little Ford
Roadster. And then in the wintertime , it would make ... See that ' s taken right after I came home from high school. You could tell I weighted a hundred...

WH:
NT: WH: WH: NT: WH: NT:
WH:
NT:
Oh boy, they fed you well at Wasatch Academy. Oh, this is Moreland .
Yeah, this is what I was going to show you. That's their store ; that's their hotel. And I keep thinking I ought to give that to the ... I don't know if the mining museum would like it or not. I have given them other pictures. Well the photographs, I take these down to Bill Fawcett-- to make negatives--and so Fred Voll(?) gets a chance to look at everything that I take. So don't worry about that.
No, I won't. But I take mine to Bill, too. Aren't those cute kids?
Yeah.
---?--- take them even if they are cute kids. ---?--- Now, this is the...
That's the tram?
... the wooden tramway.
Boy, that's a beautiful photo. I've never seen that. I went up to Moreland, oh, about three weeks ago, my mother-in-law lived there. Her name was Hirokio Okura and you know, there was an old Japanese camp up there.
I didn't know she lived at Moreland. I thought they were all at Hiawatha.
Uh huh. She never lived at Hiawatha. They were at Kennilworth. She was born in the Jap boarding house up
22

  WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
there and then they went to Seiko(?) and then they were at Moreland until it closed. And we couldn't find ...
WH: There's nothing up there.
NT:
WH: NT: WH:
... It's all grown over with sagebrush . But now I know what I saw because these foundations for the tram are still there. But I didn't know what it was for. Well, that's very helpful, thank you. What's that?
That's my school picture when I was in the second grade. Is that at Hiawatha?
Yeah. This little girl here was married to T.N. Jenson(?) and this is her brother. And then she had, her brother had a twin sister here someplace...right here she is.
NT: What building was this?
WH: Now this was down and as you go across the railroad
tracks--coming into Hiawatha, you know there's that big long string of houses--and it was a rock building over against the hill side and it was a two-room. They had that building and then they had one up in East Hiawatha built exactly like it. And the first year we were in Hiawatha my sister went up there to school. And then they closed that school, and, I guess, that's when they started scattering kids all over. But, this, over in this wing's are first and second grade, and I was in the second grade. And the third and the fourth grade was over here and this is my sister. She always laughs at some of
23

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
the pictures she ever had taken with her glasses on. But, anyway, and she was over here. And this, do you know Dan Garber?
NT: Uh huh.
WH: Well this is his mother Myrtle.
NT: Oh, I see.
WH: And she was Miss Myrtle, her maiden name's Clark. And
this was her first year of teaching school.
NT: Oh, my goodness! Who was the other teacher, do you
remember?
WH: I have been trying to think of her name and she was only
there the one year. And she was from the East.
NT: Well, Myrtle Clark, where was she from? Here?
WH: Her mother- -the reason she came down to Hiawatha was- -her
mother was managing the hotel. And her mother had not been there very long. Myrtle went to the University of Utah, college. But they were originally from Colorado--I think around Walsenburg. I know she talks about Walsenburg a lot. But, anyway, over there someplace. But, so then she came to Hiawatha and got into school.
NT: Did you kids get dressed up special for the picture?
WH: You wouldn't know it, would      I said it must have been very stylish for every, for the girls to have illregular
hemlines and everybody having their petticoats showing. And we get a kick out of that. Boy, look where his hand
24

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
is! He must have had an itch. (that's what it sounded like) But this little boy right here, look at the tie, he came to school that way every day.
Really?
He came with his shirt buttoned and a tie on.
So this was just the way that you normally dressed?
Uh huh.
I love those big hair ribbons. That's wonderful.
Look at this one here. I always fell to pieces two minutes after I got dressed.
Which one is you?
And see, you can see the hole in my stocking.
Oh, yeah!
I always had a hole in my stocking.
You must have been something of a tomboy.
I sure just despaired them.
Oh my goodness. How many children are in your family? My mother had four girls but one girl died before I was born. And then my oldest sister died the month before she was eighteen.
Oh, what a shame. So there's just the two of...
The two of us left, uh huh. I was my dad's boy.
NT: WH: NT: WH: NT: WH:
NT: WH: NT: WH: NT: WH: NT: WH:
NT: WH: NT:
WH:
It sounds it, it sounds it. I sure appreciate you showing me this.
Do you want to set this up again, sometimes you might be
25

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY interested in?
NT : WH:
OK. (break in taping)
. .. company had what they call "the official cottage" in
Hiawatha for the officials when they came down. Another thing, in the early days they paid with cash, such as gold and silver.
NT: Oh, they did?
WH:
NT: WH: NT: WH:
And they, my father would have to ride what they call the "pay wagon" and then he would deputize men to go with him. And they, the money box would be sitting in the middle of this pay wagon and the men would be sitting
this way with their rifles.
Oh, I see, on either side of the box.
Uh huh. And the box was in the middle of them.
Was it a horse-drawn wagon?
Uh huh. And in the wintertime, it was a sled. And when they went to Heiner(?), they went on a railroad car, on a train. And just my father went then, but he sat in the baggage car with his rifle across his knee and he says
"looking like an asp." (Laughter) That's what he had to do.
How big was that pay box?
Oh, I guess it was about like this.
About three feet by two feet and about a foot high? Probably a foot and a half high. Here's two feet.
NT: WH: NT: WH:
26

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
NT: About two feet long?
WH: NT: WH: NT: WH: NT:
WH:
NT: WH:
NT:
WH: NT: WH:
It was almost a square, not quite . Isee.
And it was heavy.
Oh, I bet.
Real heavy.
I always though that the company paid in, you know, scri p.
They had, I don't know if all companies did, but evidently, they, all companies had scrip. Because I see there ' s some fellow trying to collect them.
Yeah, I see that in the paper.
And so, anyway, but I know Hiawatha did. And you'd draw the scrip and then it was deducted from the worker's paycheck.
Well, when did they quit paying in gold and silver and start paying in scrip?
No, they never paid in scrip.
Oh, they never did?
No, they started paying, well, I guess they started with paper money. When did they go off the silver standard? I don't know . I really don't        I'm sorry. And then they were using more paper money than they were... They completely dropped the gold and it was just silver and paper money. And then they eventually, I think it was
27

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
just before World War II, and they went into the checks.
NT: Yes, right. But did you still have a shop at the company store? Even though you were paid gold and silver?
WH: Well, it was the only place you could go. I mean, they did run a, what they called a, the stage, the Arrow Stage Line, and it went to Hiawatha, and people could come down on that. But there was nothing that the company said that you had to shop at their store. If you didn't want to, if you get someplace else, more power to you. But they had, really had a real nice set up. They had this store and in that they had a real good department store and a grocery store. And then in the building next to them, was the meat market. And they had built in the back of the meat market, they had built an ice plant that was operated with ammonia. And so people could buy ice and put in their refrigerators. And it was delivered twice a week. You ordered it, though, and you paid for it. And it came in blocks of 25 or 50 pounds. And then eventually they built the third building. And in that there was a beauty shop, was in the first section. And then there was a little tailor shop. And that fellow was, you know, a self-employed individual. His       was ... no, I won't tell you. And then there was the shoe repair shop. And then the barber shop was up on the other end. And those people were all self-employed people.
28

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
NT: Oh, they were? They weren't paid by the company?
WH: No.
NT: But the company allowed them to come in and work?
WH: Yeah, they built the building and rented it to them, at
a very nominal rent.
NT: That's interesting. So when was it that they had this ice
that you could buy and so on?
WH: As long as we were there, they had already put the ice
plant i n.
NT: In 1915 and then it continued to operate?
WH: Uh huh. Until they CfOSed the meat market, and I don't
know when that was because by then I had married and had
moved to Price.
NT: What year did you marry?
WH: Thirty-five.
NT: Uh huh. Did you go back to Hiawatha to visit?
WH: Oh, yeah. We'd go back and we'd get hungry and my mother
would feed us. Because we were depression... NT: That's right .
WH: . . . couples. And my mother loved to cook and we went back a great deal. And then during the war years my husband went into the service in December 28, 1943. And he came home on a furlough to ship overseas that following August. And he was so upset about the kids. I thought the kids were doing pretty good. But he sure didn't think
29

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
none of the boys were doing too pretty good, let me tell you. And so he asked my mother if I could move up with her, because by then my father was over at Moreland. And he was just coming home two days, twice a week. And so, of course, she was glad to have me and so my husband announced that's what he was doing with his family.
How nice!
NT: WH:
I was really upset, but then I realized it was for the better, because Mother was alone and I was alone and we were getting all sorts of people... I'm sure they were as good as I, but they were on different cultures and so I knew that Hiawatha was a better place to raise my kids when I didn't have a husband to help me. And it turned out to be just that.
Good. Did your mother ever work? I mean, I know that your dad was the marshal, did your mother ... ?
My mother was a telephone operator and she was ... Now, I don't remember just when she started, but we hadn't been in Hiawatha too many years when she started. And then I think she quit just before the war years, I don't quite remember. But, I thought she might be interested in the years of the flu.
Y es. 1918, you mean? Let's see, this is 1918. OK.
NT:
WH:
NT: WH: NT:
30

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
WH: ...the winter picture. This is, they had a guard shack in
1922 at the railroad tracks, my father was down there taking... He let his guard go home so we were taking pictures down there. But you see these... this is the icicles.
NT: My gosh.
WH: And then after this picture was taken, we had a
snowstorm. And it covered the fences and you can see where ---?--- and them came down the steps. Well, after this snowstorm we just walked out. The snow was so deep.
NT: Was this in 1919?
WH: Uh huh. Now these people were, she was registered nurse
and I don't know her name. And this was Bill Berenson. And he was, oh I guess we'd call them "aides" now, but he helped take care of the male flue patients. And this was Frone(?) Myers, and she was the mother-in-law to the superintendent there. And they were the three that tried to take care of people with the flu, God bless us. As they had turned the amusement hall into a pest(?) house ...
NT: Uh huh. So they put all the flu victims in the amusement hall?
WH: Yeah. Because, well, one thing, we had a lot of them that were bachelors. And then we had, they did take one lady down there because she lived way at the top, almost up to
31

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
the mine. And it was too hard for the doctor to get up to her and so they moved her down. And that's what they did. They tried to move where the people were out a-ways, you know, to make it, because he just didn't have, he couldn't spend his time traveling. He wasn't getting any sleep, anyway. But when my sister got the flu, why, of course, they kept their home .
NT: Uh huh. Did they have a hospital then?
WH: It was a small one. It was what they have now. It had
been built but I don't remember just when it was built,
but it had been       
NT: So there must have been just too many flu victims for . . . ? WH: Oh, yes . However, Dr. Nixon was very fortunate, he didn't
lose too many. Now he lost the lady they moved down from up by the mine, but she was a woman that weighted 300 pounds .
NT: Oh, well, she probably couldn't have standed it.
WH: And she wasn't cooperative to start with. She, he told her to stay in bed and then he went out to see her, when
he was making rounds, and she was outside shoveling snow.
You know, this sort of thing. So see...
NT: Yeah. No, she wouldn't make it. Dr. Nixon, you said his
name was?
WH: Uh huh. Ernest Nixon. He was, I believe, a native of
Huntington. Anyway, he was a native of Emery County, 32

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY someplace.
NT: Oh, I see.
WH: Very excellent doctor.
NT: Did he stay at Hiawatha very long?
WH: Oh, yes. Well, he was there, I think three years. See, I
tell you, my memory isn't that good.
NT: Oh, it's doing just fine.
WH: But...
NT: Poor guy, though, to get there for the flu. Had he been
there long when the flu struck?
WH: No, because he'd just gotten out of school and served his
internship and gotten married and came so... Now, this building here was down, oh, in Loreblack(?) below the tracks and it was where Blackhawk used to be. And this was the store for down there.
NT: There's nothing there now but foundations. I went there, too.
WH: Yeah, it's where they built the flattops, the flattop foundations are there.
NT: Yeah, and dead poplars. About all.
WH: NT:
WH: NT :
I think that was probably all you...
Now, you said your sister got the flu, but she recovered,
I think.
Uh huh.
That's good. Now what kind of quarantine arrangements did
33

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
they have with the flu? Or, what else did they do?
WH: NT : WH :
Well , they closed the schools. And ...
I ' ll just sit down for now, you can take those up later.
. . . t h e y , t h a t w a s j u s t a b o u t i t . A n y k i n d o f entertainment, public entertainment was closed.
NT: Uh huh. So they didn't need the amusement hall, anyway?
WH:
No. I was, it was 1919, because I was nine years old. And it was getting to be quite a problem and while my mother, before my sister got sick, my mother was working night shift and they couldn't they just, the janitor and everybody was sick. And so my mother said, well, she would keep the mine office, because the telephone office was in the mine office and she would keep it reasonably clean. Because she could turn her switch on and she would hear that when somebody called in, this bell would ring. And so then my father would come at midnight and then he would help her clean the offices. And so that ' s how they kept the building cleaned. And then the people, you know, my father was post master.
Oh, he was?
For a while, because the postmaster got sick. But, anyway, he just did, you know, .whatever. Well, because my mother was a telephone operator, we used to go down and sit with her, you know. And we sort of learned the switchboard. Well then when my sister got sick, in the
NT: WH:
34

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
meantime, uh some of the other operators were sick so the head electrician was operating the switchboard from six in the morning until ten at night.
Oh, my goodness!
Because they had to keep that switchboard going. And once in a while somebody could go in and relieve him for a while, you know, but then those that, he expected to be there. Well then my sister got sick and my mother had to stay home with her because she was irrational. They thought she was going to die. And they didn't have anybody and so the superintendent asked Dad if he thought
I would go down. And so I would go down at 10. My mother would fix a lunch for Dad and I would go down at ten and I was there in the telephone office all by myself until midnight. And then my dad would come. And so what I would do, I'd go through the building and when I wasn't busy, and I'd set out the wastebaskets and the good old
cuspidors, spittoons. NT: Right.
WH: So anyway, then where the electrical portion of the telephone board, the switchboard was, was in a room right next to the telephone office, of course. And that was all that was back there was this big board. And so they got the bright idea that what they'll do is shove the bodies in there, so that, and that's where the mortician, when
NT : WH:
35

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
he had time, would come and pick up the bodies.
NT: Oh, wonderful!
WH:
And one night, I was told later that they were drunk, now
I doubt it, but the mortician could have been. But
anyway, they came and they had these wicker baskets that
squeaked and I wasn't supposed to know--the
superintendent said he'd kill anybody that told me that
'
there were bodies in that room--and so I wasn't supposed to know there was bodies in there. But I heard this basket one night squeaking and I started to open the door. Well, I recognized the mortician, Mr. Flynn, and I had seen pictures of the--you know, in the movies--of these baskets. So I hurried up and shut the door because I didn't want him to pick me up. But anyway, this one night they came and they were, Mr. Flynn was hitting wall-to-wall the basket. And I found afterwards he had two bodies in there. And anyway, all of a sudden, the gentleman that was with him, who shall remain... Anonymous .
...anonymous, because he's well-known, anyway, he swung the door open and Flynn gave this basket a shove. And it came in right by my seat       I was sitting talking to the Price operator--because I was checking tickets for the day--and I let out this godawful scream. And she was saying ... that was Mrs. Verne ... oh, she was Phil
NT : WH:
36

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
Coarseley's sister ... but anyway, she was chief operator down here and she was checking tickets and I let out this scream, and she said, "Wilhelmina, Wilhelmina, what's the matter? What's the matter?"
NT: Oh, no.
WH: And so Mr. Flynn spoke into my mouthpiece and said,
"She's alright, I just scared her." And so, anyway, she said, "Hang up, honey, and I'll call you back." And so when she called me back, she wanted to know what happened, and I said they threw the dead basket at me. But anyway, but that's where they would put the bodies and then he ' d come and ... two or three bodies, well I don't think we ever had three at once, but then he'd just have to, because he was the only mortician in town, and he would just go        from camp to camp.
NT: For sure .
WH: And he was getting worn out, it's no wonder he came up
there drunk.
NT: Yeah. Did they bury many people at Hiawatha? Or would
they bury them down here?
WH: Well they were, some of them were sent to their home
states, wherever they were f ! om. Some were buried in Price, Helper, just all around. I don't remember any of the flu victims being buried in Hiawatha. There is a little cemetery in Hiawatha--and I want to talk to you
37

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
about that later, too.
NT: OK!
WH: Now what else do you want to know?
NT: How long did the flu last up there at Hiawatha? You know,
the quarantine and all of that?
WH: Well, they quarantined us before Christmas sometime, I
don't know just when it was. It was before Thanksgiving and then we didn't go back to school until about March. And then we were in school all summer. And the next winter they quarantined again. We had another outbreak, but not as severe. And they quarantined us again. But we weren't quarantined nearly as long.
NT: Uh huh. Well, now why don't you tell me about the cemetery?
WH: Turn your speaker off.
NT: OK. (Break in taping)
NT: (later) Hiawatha cemetery. Now there's the book on
your baby that I know about.
WH: Two Miller children.
NT: Uh huh.
WH: And that little Greek girl whose first name is Mary, but
I don't remember her last name and she was about ten years old when she was buried there. I think she is the oldest that was buried there.
NT: And you said she was the first one buried there? 38

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
WH: Yes.
NT: Uh huh. And where are the other graves of the Primy
babies?
WH: They're up on the hill and I don't, it's the little hill,
you know, when you come into town, and what they call, refer to as Stringtown, Jennings Avenue. And there's a hill in back of those houses and then on the other side of the hill is a little valley and they call that Greektown. OK, on the top of that hill are graves.
NT: Up behind Greektown?
WH: Behind Greektown and Tramptown, er ...
NT: Japtown?
WH: No, it didn't go up...
NT: Not up that far?
WH: No.
NT: OK. And about how many graves were there, do you know? WH: Oh, there were about four.
NT: Uh huh. Is that where people just normally put their
premature babies?
WH: Well, they didn't know what else to do with them.
NT: Why didn't they put them in the cemetery?
WH: Well, when those babies were     there, they didn't have
a cemetery.
NT: Oh, I see. Well, why didn't they put the cemetery where
the graves were , then?
39

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
WH: Well, they...up on a hill?
NT: Yeah, I guess not, huh.
WH: But there was a road there where they put the cemetery
and it was in back of the depot. Went down across the tracks in back of the store and then up the little hill and it was seemed like an ideal place because it was nice and flat .
NT: Yeah, but they sure haven't kept it up. OK. Oh, and then your mother never did move her baby from Castle Gate then?
WH: No.
NT: She just left her there?
WH: Uhhuh.
NT: Was, well how did she die?
WH: Pneumonia .
NT: Oh, that's a shame. So that was the first child that your
mother lost, right? WH: Yes.
NT: And then she had the three more girls?
WH: Yeah.
NT: I see.
WH: See, she had the two girls in             two oldest were
born in Kansas. And then Ethel was born in Castle Gate
and I was born in Castle Gate.
NT: Uh huh. And Ethel's the one that died?
40

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
WH: Uh huh.
NT: And was buried there. What are the names of your two
oldest sisters?
WH: Doris Charlotte and Julia Inzie.
NT: Uh huh.
WH: And then Thelma Ethel and Wilhelmina. That's the family. NT: And so your being the youngest, you got to be the boy,
WH: NT:
WH:
huh?
Because, well, my sisters weren't the one ---?---.
OK. (break in taping) (later) ... saying when one of your dad's job was to raise and ...
Raise and lower the       And my father also planted the lawn in the city square, all around the office and the post office, amusement hall, all there. And that was his pride and joy. And so that's what, we used to like to go down and catch the flag for him and help him fold it. And these, we were dressed up for that parade I told you they were having on ...
Armistice?
...Armistice Day.
Yes. So every day, what, seven days a week, you'd have to raise and lower the flag?
Yes . (Break in tapins) (later) ... dairy was built by the
Iron and Steel's(?) fuel company so that the employees could have good pure milk. It was a very modern dairy and
NT: WH: NT:
WH:
41

 WILHELMINA HOLDAWAY
it was a first small dairy around that pasteurized their milk. And they brought in a veterinarian from Wyoming by the name of Robert McKinnon. And his one daughter still lives here, Mrs. Jack Houston. And they built a home for the caretaker and then they built a bunkhouse, along with these modern barns and the milkhouse and so forth. And I don ' t remember just where they got the dairy herd, but it was holsteins, I think, anyway, they were the black and white cow, brown and white cow.
NT: Yes. When did they built the dairy? Open the dairy? How old were you? High school, junior high?
WH: No, I probably was in the seventh or eight grade. NT: Yes. And so how long did the dairy operate?
WH: Well, the McKinnon boys operated it after the...
