 THE FOLLOWING IS AN INTERVIEW WITH LEONARD O. DA VIS, CONDUCTED BY SUZANNE SIMON, AT 1 3 0 8 N. CENTER, CASA GRANDE, ARIZONA, ON JANUARY 22, 1971. [THIS IS PART OF THE UTAH URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT. TAPE #1.]
ss: ---?--- any of this.
LD: Well, did you want these now?
SS: Yes, I'd like to know who was down there early on and
so forth.
LO: Well, in 1948 was when the mill--!'m sure this is
right, the mill they built it. Charlie Pike and Don King were in charge, and Parker and myself went down and we did the writing. We were only down there about ten days that summer. Then they closed it down that winter. When they opened it up the next spring, Mr. Parker went back in as superintendent and I went back as--general foreman was the classification, and it was Dick Shreeve was the mill foreman. This consisted of the chiefs of the whole thing. From then we were operating, we ran about 30 tons a day and naturally
we had improvements in the m ill. The thing about B ill Barrett, you know how the White Canyon comes together--this has nothing to do with the mill and
the uranium industry, this is a history of the community--Bill Barrett started what he called the Trading Post. This consisted of a building I would say about eight feet wide but not over fourteen feet long. When he first started you could buy a can of

 LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
salmon with all the beer you want. This was the meeting place to where everything went through. Well, Bill ran it, then there was a fellow that got in with him, Myron Furrie. Myron really increased the size of their trading post. Then people, in their housing here, you had to furnish your own housing. Well, I went back down there on a single status. I got lumber in and I got a bunch of beer and the boys built my house on a Sunday. You see, it was a community thing. It cost me seven cases of beer for it, but everybody was working. They built this house but it had no--it was just studding with outside boards on it and it had a roof on it and no windows and no door. Then I
went after my wife. Well, we moved in there in an old pickup. We drove down there, drove up in front of this old cabin, and my wife looked around and said, "Well, where do you live?" "Right there." She stepped out in sand up above her ankles. And--Mother, do you
want to tell her about your experiences there?
MB: You go right ahead.---?---.
ss: You can come in in a few minutes and add to it, okay? LD: It was three days trying to get a bath. No door,
people calling on her. It was real interesting. But your land was designated. You couldn't own it; you had to pay government lease. This was due to the
2

 LEONARD 0 . DA VIS # 1
government built this dam. So you leased it from year to year. This was the first year actually. [During) the uranium boom there started to be a lot of prospectors come in. People, you know, checking the
country. One fellow I remember particularly was Joe Plasser. He came from California. He was a World War I pilot. He was an older feller. He came in and he staked some pretty nice claims. There was an island-- well, what you would call an island, off over by itself. Joe made quite a little bit of money. Then there was another guy by the name of--Mother, what was that guy, Louie? You know, the one that died of a heart attack?
the time for the Vanadium Corporation (of America]. Then you had all kinds of people that were, you know, just tourists coming through in this country. Have
you ever been there?
ss: Yeah, I was there this summer.
LD: Well, you know where that Shinarump series goes
around through there? The blue strata? SS: Uh huh.
LD: In this thing you can take a geiger counter and there's a strip I would say anywhere from about a
3
Bennings?
MB:
LD: Yeah, Louie Bennings was his name. He prospected all

 LEONARD 0 . DAVIS #1
half [inch] to an inch that would run around 4% uranium. You can take the geiger counter go up to that. When you hit that, boy, everything goes wild. Well, naturally these people would stake these. Now there's no way on God's green earth that you can make a go on an inch streak. But we would run the samples
for nothing. Then they would come in and they would go up there with the geiger counter and dig out that one little channel you see, of four inches, you know, an inch, maybe a half inch wide, this would run 4%. Then they would get all ready to mine. Well, maybe the ore would run 10/lOOths. 10/lOOths is damn skinny. Then they think he's stealing their ore. A lot of things that way. But what they--! don't know. It was a real nice experience. We stayed there for three years. When I lived there, there were some real nice people. Some of them are still alive. I'm not
going to talk too much on personalities. I did have one hell of a time getting people in there, you know, to work.
SS: Y eah.
LD: I remember I put a notice in the Durango paper one
time that I'd be in there to interview people from one to five for jobs. I was in the unemployment office and I sat there from one to five and not a
4

 LEONARD 0. DAVIS #1
soul came in, nobody. I went into the bar and some big fellow came in; I hadn't even sat down when this big fellow came in with a suitcase and he sat down. I asked him where he was from, he said he'd just come
in off a road job. I asked him about having a drink. I bought him quite a few drinks. But anyway, he said, "Let's go for a ride." He laid down in the pickup and went to sleep, you know, and that's that. When he woke up he was in White Canyon. This was really a--but this man, he stayed there. He was still there when I left.
ss: Is that right?
LD: Uh huh. We had some real characters like Jim Stevens.
He'll tell you about--one morning he came by. There was another woman, you know, a great big woman there. She was dangerous. Jim went over to this little bar I was talking to you about and he got in an argument with this woman. Well, he asked me, he said, "Can I have a couple hours off?" He was having a fight with this gal. "Sure Jim, you go ahead." So he went over and had a beer. According to Bill Barrett this old gal hit him. Knocked him clear out the door. If Jim didn't spill all of his beer. Jim came back over and said, "Can I have a couple more hours off?" I said, "Ah, Jim why don't you just take the whole day off?"
5

 LEONARD 0. DAVIS #1
He started to walk off and he came back and he said,
"Would it be okay if I took two days off?" So he went back over and he contested this old gal again and she knocked him clear out through there. He set up and this old guy went home. My God, he went up to her house and she done near killed him thatсtime. There are some funny people ---?--- One time we had a revolution here. One guy ran off with another man's wife and everybody was getting their guns. I got their guns and brought them home and put them under the bed until my wife sat on the bed. But anyway everyone was all straightened out. They're real interesting. Am I telling what you want to know?
ss: Just great, real great. One thing I'd 1ike to talk about a little bit is what it was like when you first went down there? The roads were terrible, weren't they?
LD: Oh, the roads were terrible. It would take you four hours to drive from Blanding in there.
ss: This was still up over the Bear's Ears, wasn't it? They hadn't built--
LO: Yeah, still up over the Bear's Ears. No, they didn't build the road around below the Bear's Ears till after we had left there. No, this was still up over the Bear's Ears. Owen Parker and I got stuck coming
6

 LEONARD 0. DAVIS #1
in there the first year he was going in. We left in the pickup and we dang near got over those Bear's Ears, then we got in a big mud puddle. We worked and we worked and we worked and we tried to sleep in the pickup. You know, I had a bedroll, but he didn't have anything. We rolled up in that dang thing and tried to sleep. The next day we tried to chain--you know, we tore the chain all to hell. All I had were some welding rods and I'd make chains and put them on and
then worked and worked, and about 3 o'clock in the afternoon I just passed the chains; got them on, got a big long pole. Now the old man, I knew--well hell, he was 70 years old. Now he was a prying on this pole and I started out and those chains just all--the old man threw down the pole and started to cuss the Vanadium Corp. I'm telling you this to be funny, not to be smart. But the old man you know wore shorts with snaps on. His shorts had come undone--he undid his pants trying to hold onto them and standing in water this deep. Well, he snapped his shorts shut and cussing the Vanadium Corp he dropped his pants. He dropped everything. I don't think I've seen anything as funny as that in my life. Well, this is all part of--I cleaned the snow away from the tree there and built a great big fire. You know, lots of---?--- but
7

    LEONARD 0. DAVIS #1
I had a little, you know, a bunch of coals. We had coffee and stuff. We made it real nice. Then I got some boughs and put down and made out the bed and the old man---?--- bed about the time it got dark. He lay there and he said, "I'm a sweating." I said, "You are?" I wasn't--oh he got scared. It was morning and I'd forgotten to move those coals, you know, and all that green stuff had all turned brown. Then we were just getting ready to walk off that hill and another bunch of people came with a four wheel drive and we got out of there. He was a real character. Nice old man. Y eah.
Well there was--how about Eddy Mulford and a real cowboy and Hoe Dunn and the younger Joe Dunn?
Yeah. Well, old Ed Mulford was 62 years old when he came in there. An old cowboy. He punched cows in all that area.
Social Security card at 62.
SS: Well I'll be darned.
LO: Yeah, and there was another old cowboy, those two old
cowboys worked around here for a long time. In fact
MD:
LD:
MD:
LD: Yeah, he lived in Richfield. I got him his first
He was from Richfield, was he not?
I think Joe was still there. MD: ---?--- and Charlie Abrams.
8
I

 LEONARD 0 . DA VIS # 1
LO: Yeah, yeah, oh yeah. Charlie Abrams was--you may not
know this, but this was a vanadium--or Don Clair is where they first brought in their first ion exchange. Are you familiar with this?
SS: No. I know that you add the copper and uranium
together to give you your . ---?---
LD: Yeah, but this was not so bad. This was when we first started. You know, this was top secret. We built a room in the ore office there and had a key with a snap on the door and Bob Woody and Charlie Abrams came out there from American Sandling with these little two inch cog wheels, and this was where they first started by leaching uranium and acid, and then by ion exchange and then rooting it with--finally came to be one or the main processes as far as uranium is concerned. Of course this was before---?- -- extraction, but this was where it first started. Charlie Abrams was a nice little fellow of course. You know with a name of Abrams, he was a Jewish boy. This--I'm not--it doesn't matter to me what he is,
but I mean he's a Jew. A nice guy, that Charlie, and he decided he had to ride a horse before he went back to Winchester. So he got young Joe Dunn to get him a horse and take him for a ride. Well, he lengthened his stirrups out. I guess you know, you've been in
9

     LEONARD 0. DAVIS #1
the West long enough to know that this is not the ideal way to ride a horse, lengthened his stirrups out just a bit and it's terribly see-saw. But he had a lot of guts. I watched him when he got off his horse and he just walked in like there was nothing wrong and I watched when he went out of there,---?--
- everybody could see him then. He walked just as straight as could be. ---?--- Charlie, well he was there about six weeks, wasn't he?
SS: Oh, yes, I think. Then they were the ones who worked out the process than that you--
LD: Well, they had this process worked out back there but they brought it out to work, to improve on it there at White Canyon. Then ultimately they built the pilot plant in Grand Junction. I went from White Canyon to Grand Junction and worked in the pilot plant. Then there were a million, million things that happened
there. Did anybody ever mention Mr. Chatman to you? ss: Chatman?
LD: He was the one that ran the ferry.
SS: Oh, yeah.
LD: You see this was--let's see, what did he charge you?
Five bucks wasn't it? Crossing on the ferry.
MD: Uh huh. The company probably, trucks.
LD: Trucks were five bucks, but I think it was a dollar
10

 LEONARDO. DAVIS #1 for individuals.
MD: LD: SS: LO:
SS:
LO: SS: LD: SS: LD: SS: MD:
Something like that.
Yeah, he was quite an old character too.
I understand that he's still living.
Somewhere he is. That old fellow is still alive somewhere. He used to take pictures you know. He'd got to the schools around. ---?---
You know what I was going to talk to him last summer
and I looked [him] up and [they] said that he was living over in around Load or Teasdale or in that area.
Yeah, I think he is. Did you know?
But he was all--
Here's Mr. Parker's picture.
Oh.
That's a very good picture.
I've never seen a picture of him before.
Our pictures are mostly like this. We went on a 3-D kick, you know at that time, and he insisted we take pictures like that. So we don't have any actual, you know, good pictures.
LD: This is a water tower. Did you ever see this old Moqui fort that was up there?
MD: Oh, it's under water. ss: It's under water.
11

 LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
LD: It's under water, yeah.
ss: In fact, when I went up there last summer I got
somebody to take me down where the mill site was and I swam over it. I couldn't see it, but I swam over it.
LD: Well, our house was right there. ---?--- Maybe this young lady would like to have a cup of coffee. Would you like a cup of coffee?
SS: I sure do.
LD: I remember this water tower at one time. We used to
get these college kids, you know, that go to college. Especially if they're taking metallurgy and mining engineering. Well, we got one kid--well, got several of them, but we got this one kid. He came from back in Missouri somewhere. He really hadn't been out here long. He wasn't actually stupid, but I mean he didn't know his way around. Well, this water tower was one moonlight night and the mill was down in her~. This kid was on the shift and the shift foreman was Illinois and I imagine you've heard of him. Well, he told this kid to go up an check the water. Well, in the meantime, Joe Dunn had put on a sheet and was standing up there by the water tower. Well, the kid goes up and sees this fellow and he turns around and
comes back. Illinois said, "Did you go check the 12

 LEONARD 0 . DA VIS # 1
water?" The kid says, "No, no, I didn't." He says,
"You go check that water, I'm going to fire you." That kid reached around a piece of pipe about four feet long. He went up there and if you've ever seen a ghost undress, that ghost really got his sheet off real fast and let him know who he was. Oh, many
things. Oh, we had nine women--
SS: Stranger leaves town.
LO: Well, listen. When these doctors came in with these
pencils and everything to tell you about radiation, we had nine women in camp. This doctor came in. He was a wise aleck and he said, "There's no doubt in my mind that you're not all sterile." No, wait. He said,
"You help with these men working on the stockpile. You don't work with metals only four hours a day. There's no doubt in my mind that you're not all sterile." In two months, 7 of the 9 women were pregnant, and the only reason the other two weren't I think was because they were too old.
MD: ---?--- Goodrich. LO: Goodrich.
MD: ---?--- Goodrich. ---?--- dollars a month. In an old Cessna.
LD: That's another two engine.
ss: And they all went to the doctor?
13

     LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
LD:
MD:
LD: MD: LD:
ss: LD:
MD: LD:
MD: LD:
MD: SS:
LD:
In Price. All went to this doctor. They went on the stork run every month.
I think that there were six boys and one girl. Isn't that right?
I think so.
Around here.
But that doctor never came back. Did you swim in that
river down there?
Well, we did swim in the river down at White Canyon. Yeah, White Canyon, you have a nice place to swim there when you're swimming up river.
---?---
Yeah, we had swimming suits.
It was hot, no refrigeration.
You get out of the river and you know wherever your bathing suit--wherever the elastic around the bathing suit, you know, that would be just chuck full of sand. It, you know, it was really--
Sugar, cream? [for the interviewer's coffee]
Black. Yeah, I'll tell you it was, let's see, in the middle of August when I went down there last summer. I found it a little warm.
Especially you know it will never cool off at night on account of the rocks. We lived pretty high there
though. Before we left we had a swamp cooler in the 14

 LEONARDO. DA VIS #1
window and running water.
MD: I had running water in the house for six months before we left. ---?---
LD: Nothing you know, outside toilets. But nobody had built tops on them.
MD: There's no sense in it.
LD: But the USGS came in with a helicopter, you see. Boy,
next thing, every man put boxes on the top. I went to that dang trading post one time. I just opened the door and pow. I got hit in the eye with a can of peaches. They were having a---?---.
MD: ---?--- They'd been down there too long. Invited him out. There was a little triangle going on and---?--- sides you see. That caused---?--- though, and it got so serious he collected every gun in that camp and brought t!'lem home and put them under our bed and immediately left the next day to go out and hire some people to come in and left me with all these guns. Isn't that a scream?
ss: I was talking to June Bailey. Do you remember--! can't remember what her husband's name was. He's dead now. But she was talking about having been in the trading post one day when a fellow charged in there
with a gun looking for his wife.
MD: That's awful. It was a great experience, but it would
15

   LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
kill me to have to live like that now. Because there was no power of any kind when we lived there. We had to put a line across because we had--
What did you say your name was now?
Suzanne.
Suzanne? You didn't want to go through all this lengthy metallurgy and the whole thing and all that stuff, did you?
Well, I'll tell you what. I'd like to hear it. I don't understand it, but it will be valuable for somebody else.
Well, do this. I think I'm going to have to go back--you realize the fact that we're talking back twenty years?
Y eah.
LO: ss: LO:
SS:
LO:
SS: LO:
Actually, I can't remember all the precipitation steps and everything that we did there. Actually we just ground the ore, then we classified it. If it's quartz sands we put it in 4 by 20 foot tanks and then---?--- this would be minus a hundred we put in
the other tanks.
---?---. It might help you a little bit. I don't know.
MD:
LO: These were improvements we were going to do. Here we go. Improving the laboratory and the office up here.
16

 LEONARD 0. DAVIS #1
This was the storage area. Now take a look at this. Then we went through and---?--- a little old 4 by, I think it was, and a 4 by 8 rod nail; yeah, it was a 4 by 8 rod ~ail then with the drag classifier now the
plans in the fire section. You know, the overflow. Then the quartz sands actually went back, way back. Then we went down and classified again, but we went
into the distributing tanks here with the quartz sand, then the slag. The fire section went in here. Then we went into acid. I think we dropped this down to a pH of about the amount of one. Now up here we had three storage tanks. You see now? This would be A, B, and C. Alright. Now A liquor would be the best. Your solution would be your best. B would be the next, and C would be practically make up. You see? Alright, then when you had all these tanks full, you would pump this water down nearly to the bottom and overflow so you would absolute contact. Then you would put your A liquor out through here, you see. So there would be what we would call a flood leak whereever grains of sand would have contact with the solution. Then if any liquor would come through here- -then after you've done that for a certain period of time you would draw it off and send it down to the
precipitation circuit. You see what I mean? 17

 LEONARD 0. DAVIS #1
SS: Y eah.
LD: Alright now, on your slime section--well, let's go on
with this. You run the A liquor up through here. Then this would be ---?--- This is what we would precipitate. Now you're ready. Now we run the B liquor through and pump it back to A, then we'd run the c liquor through and pump it back to B, then we'd run the new liquor and pump it back through and put it back to c. Do you see what I mean? This was in--- ?--- Alright now, this kind of precipitation was a long time ago. We precipitated ---?---. We had to boil this stuff. We made an aluminum sludge. Now I'd
like to go back and study that all out to let you know exactly what it was like. But we made the precipitation, we precipitated. We washed it, we had to wash it real good. We washed the cake. From there we took it over here and dried it. Naturally you had the solution and you threw it out. Then you had this aluminum sludge section which at that time we didn't have any way to handle. That's why they came in with this new process to get away from using the sludge and everything. They actually took the solution, pregnant solution, and put it through ion exchange. This would adhere to the resin and then you would come along with an aluminum nitrate or something like
18

 LEONARD 0 . DA VIS # 1
this to---?--- it and take it off, put it back into the solution formula. Then your test would -- ?--- to acid which just drops your uranium out in purified
form. Not as purified as you're thinking about the bomb, but as purified uranium. Now this was a kind of an obsolete thing. Then before we were done, we went over here on the edge of the hill and we put in a-- -?--- circuit and we hauled the tailings back up and put it through a tank and we floated the copper up. Now we never could get all the uranium out of the
copper. It ran about 30/lOOths, which was not supposed to be sold to the smelter, but we did anyway. We also had this same problem in ---?--- Does this give you a fairly good picture?
SS: Yeah, I frankly don't understand all the chemistry, but I get an idea of the physical plant.
LD: What I could do is actually--this would take time-- but I've done all this old metallurgy on this thing and I have this in my office.
MD: I think you have every bit of it.
LD: Every bit of metallurgy I've had anywhere. I'd have
to sort it out.
ss: If you could--! was just going to say if you could,
if you have time and don't mind, if you could make me a kind of survey, you know, a summary of it.
19

   LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
LD: SS: LD: MD:
LD: MD: LD:
Well, I could probably do that and give that to you.
I sure would appreciate it. It would be a--
I don't have much to do.
You don't dear. Something to do. You forgot to tell her about the Hercules motor you had there.
Oh.
The motor itself was a character too.
That Hercules motor, it was a 1919 Hercules engine and we had an old generator--gol, I don't know when it was built. Well, we'd excite this old generator and we'd crank old Herc up. We had a big old clutch. We'd get 2 or 3 guys and we'd put it in gear and there'd be another guy in the front and we'd get her going. The only control we had on this was light. You run it when you thought the light was about right. That power would go anywhere from 320 volts to 500.
Just--then we had some accidents and one fellow leaned down. No, they built a little shed in front of the boiler. That's where those guys would keep warm. They piped steam into this thing, but they put a 15 gallon tank on there on a drum; 15 gallons. It was an oil drum with a pipe on it. Well, this would have been fine if they hadn't have put a valve on the end of the pipe. Somebody put the valve on the end of the pipe. The steam came in to keep the barrel warm and
20

  LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
of a time catching him.
SS: A little jet propulsion there, huh?
LD: Yeah, he took off. There was an office girl. She
climbed a mountain and fell down and broke here pelvis up there and we had to get her down from that place. But we never did have any actual casualties as
far as--
MD: Yeah, for as rough as we had to live. We didn't even
have a doctor.
LD: The people did get along pretty fairly well.
MD: Well they had to. They had to make their own amusement and everything else.
LD: We had a nice time there. We had enough when we moved out.
MD: Two and a half years of it.
LD: Uh huh, two and a half years of it.
SS: Then you really had the earliest, the roughest time
too, I imagine.
LD: Well, it didn't last long after that.
MD: No, it didn't.
LD: It didn't put out enough ore to make it pay. But we
had developed this new process in Grand Junction and the Vanadium Corp. decided not to go along with it. So consequently they built that road then over to
Mexican Hat and shipped ore over there. 22

 LEONARD 0. DAVIS #1
ss: Oh, thank you. [Mrs. Davis serves her something) MD: Uh huh.
LD: Did you do an interview with Fletch Bronson?
SS: Well, I can say this. One of the other gals talked to
him that's interested in--
MD: Remember they did establish a post office down there?
LD: Oh, yeah, we had--
MD: On the first of December 1952, wasn't it?
LD: Oh, yeah, we had the first overland airmail.
MD: Air route, air mail in the United States.
SS: Is that what sky route means? I had--somebody told me
that's what it was. But I didn't know--
LD: It was the first.
MD: It was just a little extra route you know from the
usual---?---.
LD: It would pick it up from Cortez to Blanding to White
Canyon twice a week. We used to ride that thing.
MD: Oh yeah, we used to---?---.
LO: Yeah, we'd ride in the airplane and it was real
worthwhile. Yeah, we had that, and we had a post
office down there.
ss: They held school down there for a little while,
didn't they?
MD: Yes, they had school.
LO: They had a good school house. The company built the
23

   LEONARD 0 . DAVIS #1
school house. They built the school house and the county furnished the teacher.
MD: Uh huh, yeah---?---. You know I can't remember---?- --. And I can't for the life of me---?---.
ss: Well, I know that there was a Pearl Baker. LD: That's her!
MD: Pearl Baker, I couldn't remember her name. I couldn't remember the name of the school teacher.
LD: Have they ever mentioned Vera Ray? ss: Somebody did. Was she the nurse? LD: No, no.
MD: V era was.
LD: He was a--Vera, it was a he. He was a millwright and his wife ran the boarding house.
SS: Oh yeah. Well, I'd heard the name, but I thought it was--
LO: Uh huh, that was the first two years down there. She was real good at that boarding house.
MD: She was.
ss: Now the boarding house that the company owned and-- LO: Uh huh.
SS: --kept for the single men.
LD: Single men, uh huh. Well, that went real good.
MD: But when we were down there, I was lucky I did have, after a fashion, you know, a cabin. Most of them
24

 LEONARD 0 . DA VIS # 1
lived in tents though. There were many that got real cold during the winter time. In fact, it snowed and everything else carried the water from the pump. I was lucky. I got water about six months before we left.
LD: Before we left. Uh huh. MD: But it was very rough.
LD: Then we had one single light bulb.
MD: Uh huh. We had an electrical refrigerator though,
which made all the difference in the world in the summertime, for ice, getting things cool. So, really I didn't have it near as bad as a lot of the rest of them. Although it was bad enough.
ss: Well, now when you all were there, I know that all the mill people, the VCA people lived there, but were there, did any of the miners?
LD: We had one by the name of Blake. ss: Oh, Chat Blake.
LD: Chat Blake who lived up there. ss: Yeah, I talked to him.
LD: And then Joe Plosher. He built him a cabin on up there.
ss: Now he's somebody I've been kind of interested in that I haven't really found out very much about. Didn't he have a mine up there or at least a claim up

No, no.
He struck it rich.
He did alright. Man, I ran into him about three years ago. Now what was that girl's name that he married? She used to go in there prospecting herself. Then they got together.
You're talking about Joe Plosher; she's talking about the other man.
Are you talking about Joe Plosher or--?
Yeah, I'm asking about Plosher.
Joe Plosher.
Now what was the girl's name?
Margaret.
Margaret.
M argaret,---?--- Margaret.
I'm not sure what her first name was.
Uh huh.
She was prospecting for ore and Joe was prospecting and he struck the mine. You know, he was out there with me. I had a part interest in that once. It was out by itself and it was just a dome out there and he
had four or five friends, but he did pretty good. He came out there with $100,000 I think.

 LEONARD 0 . DA VIS # 1
MD: LD:
Enough to buy himself a ranch.
He bought a ranch in Idaho and then he sold the ranch
in Idaho. Then they ran the--when I talked to him he ran the trailer park over here by Phoenix somewhere. Yeah, he did alright, and Blake I think did pretty good. He had some property up on the other side of the Happy Jack.
Now let me see. He was interested in the Gizmo, wasn't he or--oh, Spook, Gizmo.
I don't know all those names.
Well, I don't know either. I tried to memorize them all when I was there, but I--there's too many of them. I couldn't keep them all separate.
Yeah, but I know when Blake came out of there, he did alright, but I guess he made his after we left there, you see.
Yeah, I guess you all had gone when the outfits like TZ had big cam ps---?---
Oh yeah, we were out of there.
We were gone by then. It was just one small group right there in White Canyon that was actually left. Yeah. I think they operated about a year after we left. I think it was about--Slats Overman, did they

talk to you about him?
ss: I have his name but I haven't found out anything,
27

 LEONARD 0 . DAVIS #1 where he is or--
LD:
Well, Slats went from there to Durango and then back over there to that Monument Number 2. He used to stop and see me when he came through when we used to live in Tuba City, you know, for a long time. I think Slats has retired since then. I believe he's down around Tombstone somewhere.
Do you remember the school teacher that worked there? Do you remember the school teacher? He came down--- ?--- We carried him, took him to Naturita at one time.
Don't let me forget to tell her about the old Doctor. What, have you forgotten about him?
The school teacher, I can't remember him.
Well, go ahead and tell her about the doctor.
Oh--it was an old guy, you know, they hired him, sent him in. A fellow about like that. He was an old man. I don't know; I'd been somewhere and I came back and there was this poor little old man trying to wrestle a hundred pounds of soda ash up onto one of these
precip tanks. I said, "Where in the hell did you come from?" He said, "They sent me in to work." I looked at him and I [thought], "No way," then I looked the other way. I said, "That guy can't handle that soda ash bag." I said, "I'll put him down at the pump." So
MD:
LD: MD: LD: MD: LD:
28

 LEONARD 0. DAVIS #1
we used to have pumps in the river you know because
of the water tower. Old flood engines withhold pumps on them. So I put this old man down there and a damn pump went and burned up. It wasn't his fault. So I got a crew and we changed a motor, the engine. Well, we got it all changed and looked around for the pump man and he was nowhere in sight. So we went back up to the cabin and there he was sound asleep on his cot. I said, "Don't wake him up. We'll let him sleep and he'll be on tomorrow." Now that old boy--I'm kind of chicken-hearted. The next morning I went over there and was going to let him go. You know you don't mind if a man cusses then you can answer back, but this old man started to cry and then he said, "Please don't fire me. I've got my reasons to be here and I don't want to be fired." I said, "Alright, damn it. I won't fire you." Well, I put him on the boiler. Well, he worked out pretty fair on the boiler. Then these kids young single kids I had would go up where the water tower was, you know up under the cliff there, they'd go up there and go to sleep.
MD: Cool, it was cool in the cave.
LD: And damn him, one day, this old man came into my
office and he said, "Davis, you're going to have an epidemic of strep throat around here." I said, "Damn
29

    LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
it, what do you know about it?" He says, "I'm a doctor."
ss: For goodness sake.
LD: I said, "Have you got anything that will back that
up?" He said, "You're damn right." I said, "Let's see it." We went down to his cabin and there was his certificate. He had torn it, but he had it. Now he really was a doctor and he had been a doctor back in Detroit. He and his wife--he had a wife that was about twenty years younger than he was and I guess they had a little difficulty. But that old guy, the only thermometer I had was out of a metallurgy class.
MD: Well, honey, I had a thermometer.
LD: But go in and taking that kid's temperature with that
long old thermometer, I thought he was sick and I got him right out of there. That kid never did come back. That old coot, was he right there? Well, he was still there after the whole damn thing closed up.
ss: Well, I'll be darned. That wasn't--his name wasn't Williamsen?
LD: That's it. Doc Williamsen. Everybody thought that he was about half nuts--which [he] was. But--
ss: I came across his name in the paper and went back and read a lot of issures in the San Juan Record. That's
how I begin to find people's names you know. 30

 LEONARDO. DAVIS #1 LO: Yeah.
SS:
LD: MD: SS: LO: MD:

I had a Doctor Williamsen, but yet everybody I ta ked to said the company hadn't hired any doctors.
He wasn't--just a laborer.
Just a laborer.
Well that's interesting.
Yeah, he was an interesting old guy.
He did save those kids from having strep throat because he did know what he was talking about,
fortunately.
I can't remember the retired school teacher.
He wasn't retired, Leonard. He was an offbeat sort of person, but he was the one that was sitting right next to Mrs. Miller when she went down.
Oh.
---?--- and I, we just stood around and watched. It was fantastic. I can't remember his name. How about the old gentleman that made the little anvil for you? Oh, it was Jack Robinson--
Yeah, Jack Robinson.
LD:
MD:
LD: He was a blacksmith. I tell you there's a man that I
had--it's awful hard for a man to work with a man that's had to work with your dad. Because I didn't know anything. You know you're trying to be a copy and you've got a----?---- going to pay no taxes.--

ss: He was a bishop, wasn't he?
LD: He was the bishop, uh huh. He f1ied; he was the
bishop, the flying bishop.
MD: He used to fly in and out of there.
ss: I still have to talk to him. I think he's in Green
River or--
'
LD: He's in Hanksville.
SS: In Hanksville? I didn't realize that. I've been
through Hanksville a couple of times, visiting the
Noyes families from over there.
LD: Yeah, is that Jake Noyes still over there?
SS: Yeah, I think he is.
LD: That guy's too lazy to breathe. Yeah, I hope he's not
a relative of yours.
SS: No, no, no. I don't have any relatives up there.
LD: Then he ran the post office. You know he met that
Phillips girl. Gol, he's lazy. SS: In Hanksville?
LD: Uh huh.
MD: There were some others. How about Daisy and what was
her husband's name? I can't remember her husband,
because all I know is Daisy.
LD: Daisy Crawford. Daisy had a bathing suit on and I had
32

 LEONARD 0. DAVIS #1
the transit out. You know, sometimes you've got o kid people. Daisy was pregnant and, hell, a good quarter of a mile away.
MD: LO:
Laying on the sand bar right in the middle of--
--the creek. So I said, "Daisy, did you know that one of your legs is shorter than the other one?" She said, "How did you know?" "Why, I had the transit on you this afternoon." "By God, you're the only one that knows--" That old gal always did believe that, did she? Daisy was quite a character. Then my wife was sitting there. She hadn't been to the store I don't think in two months.
You laugh at that Donny Brook, I'll hate you.
---?--- knock on the door. "Jim, I want to talk to you." "Alright, come in." "No, no, I want to talk to you outside." We went outside and he says, "I've got to tell you something." He says, "Your wife is a cleptomaniac." I said, "She is?" "YeahI she steals stuff out of that store over there." She hadn't even been to the store---?--- that was running it was it?
MD: LD:
MD: Who, Bill? Well, ---?---.
LD: Yeah, a cleptomaniac. You sure get some stories
around here. You can't believe it. I told her about Jim and Clod blowing up the pump.
MD: Well you didn't tell about the mine maiden yet. 33

 LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
SS: You told me that story before you turned this thing
on. Why don't you tell it again?
LO: Well, Clod Simons was a river rat and Jim. If you
ever see-~I had quite a bit to do with Jim and Clod and Ed Mulford. Jim and Clod, Jim had this old Chevrolet motor and Clod had the pump. They planted a garden and were pumping and somehow they got to arguing over this thing. So they got a powder magazine, got some dynamite, put it under it, and pow--that settled the argument right there. It blew it all to hell. Well, I talked to you about this fellow Chatman, you know. You know there was a nice ranch down there, had all kinds of grapes and fruit.
MD: Any kind of--
LD: Anything that you wanted down there. ---?--- and we
used to haul. I had barrels too. The company had some barrels and I had a new barrel. So this got on Jim's nerves and Ed Mulford's nerves about the grapes over there and I had the barrels. They got down and talked to me about it. They said, "Now you take those barrels to the Katteracks and let's have a little
wine." So I got up one day and I said, "Alright now, you take a pickup and you go over there and there's that time scattered out and take a shovel and cover that up, then go up and get the grapes." I said,
34

 LEONARD 0. DAVIS #1
"This way everything's all covered up. You won't have to pay the ferry or nothing." So I went and got them, and there was enough to make two big barrels of wine. Well, we got a report on this from Jim every morning. He was a wine maker. He'd come up to me and he'd say,
"Boy, it's a working real good, it's a working real good." One morning he went ---?--- and my God, he said, "I'm going to try it tonight." Old Mulford, he said, "Uh oh." He was right, uh oh. Jim got on that wagon. Milford said, "Let's go get that stuff." I had two little five gallon cans. We started to strain that stuff. I'll bet you that it was about that many of those little bugs--what do you call them? Crickets?
MD: Crickets.
LD: And old Mulford looks at that and he said, "Oh my
God, that little fellow's going to jump for miles." So we carried off about two kegs of that damn stuff, buried it off the trail.
MD: I don't know if it's still there. It may still be there.
LD: We never drank it. That was crippling. Old Mulford says, "Uh oh, little feller's going to be drunk from now on." Then Mulford and Jim and I went over to
Richfield to buy some groceries and get some meat. so 35

 LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
he goes by some fellow's place out there and he sold us a steer. Well, Jim you know is a dang good butcher. He's a real good butcher. So he just hog dressed this beef and we hauled it back to White Canyon put it up, and Jim, you know, can dress the beef and cut meat real good. We had the meat all cut up and here come the sheriff. "That's stolen beef. The hide, the works." The only thing that saved us is when I had made out this check for this feller I had written on there for beef.
ss: I'll be darned.
LD: That's the only thing that saved us from being up for
stealing beef. ---?---.
ss: The cattle companies ran cattle out there.
LD: Oh yeah, Indian Creek Cattle Company, but nobody ever
bothered their cattle. MD: No, not there.
LD: To my knowledge I never knew of anybody ever stealing their cattle. We did kill a little venison up there. You know, on the Bear's Ears.
SS: Y eah.
LD: But this was a good thing because that's---?--- just
starved to death. You know, there's too many deer. Fishing; they have quite a little bit of fishing down
there, there are catfish and catfish fries. 36

Movies. They have movies.
Movies, yeah.
Yeah, they finally got movies in.
Got movies, we had movies. Then we had--
We had bake sales and all sorts of things.
Airplanes. There were usually three or four airplanes there all the time. Joe Plosher was there, had a plane, and this bishop and I, we had a plane between us. I couldn't fly it but he could. Well, Millers had
a big plane there. Then we had that little plane of Joe Cooper's for a while and then Plosher had his plane. ---?--- pretty nice little airstrip there.
It was the only way to travel.
Yeah, it was the only way to get in and out of that place.
Four hours to Blanding. Oh, my that was--then after you'd get there you'd just be caked with dirt. You know, couldn't have the windows shut. I got so I
wouldn't even bring the little kids up with me. Lucky there---?---.

They all went over by boats. 5:30 in the morning he
came back.
LD: Gee, I 'd just gotten in bed when ---?--- came over
and wanted to take my picture. You know, he had this 3-D bug. I had to get up and get there with blurry eyes while he took it.
SS: You warmed that house up real good. MD: Oh, that's for sure.
LD: Well, I warmed everybody's house up. MD: Oh, everybody's house up.
LD: They always had a house warming whether it was a tent or a house or what it was.
SS: Yeah, but you know that sounds like a pretty good life.
MD: We had lots of fun. We had just lots of fun down there. ---?--- we could go anywhere else and weе11 never forget White Canyon. We couldn't.
LD: No. There's now way we could forget the people. They didn't care for nothing. I mean--well, not all of them.

I should have. Well, they ran out of coffee so they were out of coffee. That's just what I said, you know. They didn't go wild about it. They were a good crew, they were good workers. There's a lot--! can't. There are so many things that you think about after you're gone.
SS: How did you get the--what did you use for fuel when you were--well, did you use oil?
LD: Oil. Uh huh.
SS: How did you get that in there?
LD: It was hauled in by truck from Cortez. Uh huh, that
was the main fuel was oil. Gad, when we lost the boiler, remember how that froze up there? We had to build fires around it. Yeah, it was a real heavy oil we used for the boiler.
SS: Uh huh.
LD: Most everybody else, most of the homes had propane.
You know, little tanks, propane. The water was real shallow so they'd have little hand pumps you know, they'd have little hand pumps. All you did was just drive a pipe down into the ground where there's a point on it with a screen; you'd drive it down till you hit water and then you'd pump this. We had water
right--
39

   LEONARD 0 . DA VIS # 1
MD: Well, it was good water though.
LO: Uh huh, it was good water. MD: It was good water.
SS: You used the water from the river for the mill? When
you--?
LD: Yeah, well, we dug sinks right by the river where the
water would come through, but believe it or not that would seal off fast with that silt when that silt was in it. Then about this time, this was when all these people started down the river, you remember? You remember when old Ed Mulford and I lost that damn
boat?
MD: Oh yes, yes.
LD: ---?--- me and Leslie took the--he had a 14' little boat. It had a five horsepower motor, or eight horse, something like that. Old Ed Mulford and I got in that thing and we were running up and down White Canyon and I said, "Well, hell Ed, let's cross the river." "Fine." So we. got in the river and I don't know too much about boats, but instead of going below this ferry, I parked up above it. Well, we looked around a little while and got back in the boat, and kicked it off. The motor didn't take and it pushed up right
down to that ferry. We were going to hit in front sideways. I said, "Ed, get out." He got out and the
40

 LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
minute when he got out of there, the boat turned and went under the ferry and I grabbed a hold of the
ferry. There was old Ed, he said, "Come on kid, get out of there."
Even got your feet wet.
Get your feet wet? I washed my shoes off. Well, this boat went under the ferry and on down the river. Golly, you know for this I had to buy a new boat and a new motor for that guy. But Goodrich had a boat on that river and he went down.
It was Clod wasn't it?
Clod told him about it, but Goodrich went down and saw old Clod there at Red Canyon there where it runs into the river. I was telling him about losing this boat. Well old Clod said, "Hey, say there's a new ripple over there, let's go look." We went over there and browsed around and they got that boat and motor
back.
new ripple. They got that boat back. Of course, it cost me quite a little bit for beer for those two fellows. But I sure was glad that they--
ss: Well, didn't the Marshings lose a child out there? 41
MD: LO:

Well, I'll be darned.

Something about a boat got tangled up with that cable?
LD: Oh yeah, that was Leon's boy. But that was after we left there. Leon's little boy. I think he must have been about twelve, wasn't he?
ss: Well, I've forgotten exactly. But it was--
LD: Yeah, he got tangled up in the cable there at the
ferry. Yeah, that didn't happen while we were there. That was after we had gone. Yeah that--you talked to Lean and Annie?
SS: Yeah, I talked to them about it. I talked to them together, so about all I heard from was Leon.
LD: Yeah, well Larry would be about to tell you more than Leon would. At this time you know you could get deferments from the draft. I went to World War II. I didn't have any deferments. No way. Danny, he said, "I sure would like to have six months." "No way, Danny." The same thing happened to that Phillips kid. Boy, he wasn't going anywhere. Both of these kids come back after the service and they said, "Sure glad
we went." It didn't hurt them. You know, Danny has always been kind of a favorite of mine. He came to work, he worked for me in Tuba City for a while. He and the Wells's kid, Donald Wells who was the bishop's boy, I gave him his first job out of high
42

  LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
school. Then they got a chance to go to Moab there where they had been working, so they went up there. I was partners, staked some claims with Danny's dad.
MD: June.
LD: June, and then the old man, Danny's dad.
MD: His name was June.
LD: No. June was a carpenter. The old man, he was a--
MD: There was June and Danny.
LD: There were the two older Marshings, Bill and myself.
Now what was Danny's dad's name? Leore, yeah, Leore. MD: Was that his name?
LD: Yeah, the kid's named after him. There's Leore, June,
Bill Wells and myself. We staked some claims up on the Dirty Hill. We got a compressor in there and June drilled holes and we forgot about our compressor and when this blast was going on, big rocks falling all around that compressor and old Leore he jumps up and says, "Hold it till I move that compressor."
MD: And that dynamite was just going.
LD: "Hold it till I move that compressor." Then I took
those two kids up there, Danny and ---?--- and the
other two. What the hell was his name? MD: The--
LD: Yeah, the one we used his car over to Grand Junction. When we got off at Whitewater instead of Grand
43

 LEONARD 0 . DAVIS #1 Junction?
MD: Jim?
LD: Well, it's Danny's younger brother. I took those two
kids up there to the mine one day. Well, so I sent up ---?--- the ground blasting it and, "Alright now, get wheelbarrow full, fill it up, and then the next guy." Pretty quick they were moving two to my one, then three to my one. "I'll go do the cooking; you guys do the mining." No, they were real good kids. I like them though. The other kid Leore knew, the other Marshing, the one that you just mentioned. June
Marshing, his boy's name was Bob.
MD: Yeah, that's right. That's right, I got--I forgot, I
got that mixed up. LD: Bob Marshing.
MD: Uh huh.
LD: Is Danny's mother still alive? She is I think. She
got married again. SS: I don't know.
LD: Yeah, she got married again.
MD: Uh huh.
SS: They didn't mention.
LD: Yeah. Well, I don't know of anything else that I
could tell you about that country. Actually when we were in there, this was before the uranium boom,
44

 LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
[which] really didn't start till 1952, you know.
SS:
MD: LD: MD:
LD:
Anyway, this was before the uranium boom really came on. Actually, the uranium boom really didn't start until 1952 when all the big companies got into it. You know, they just went--but then were the days of the smaller prospector when he was out with the geiger counter and jeep.
How about people, greenhorns going out there and getting lost? Did you ever have to go find them; bring them in?
Bill was always--
Bill was always doing that stuff.
Bill Wells would take his planes out, but his trouble
was the nuts that would try to go down the river on
canoes.
We could have paid for an airplane with this. But
this was not to keep people getting lost in the
river. It would be, say, a group 1ike you, your
husband, and two or three more. They'd come down
there and they'd launch their boats and the next
I
morning, so help me God, one of their mothers would get worried about them. So they would hire Bill Wells to fly down and see where they were at and come back, and this was a steady income for that little air--we
had a little old tailor aircraft plane and he pretty 45

 LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
near paid for it with those flights down the river checking on them and coming back telling their parents where they were at.
Well, Hite was one of the launching places for those

MD: ss:

regular river trips down there.
---?--- Weight had that.
I talked to Frank Wright that I guess took a lot of those trips down.
Yeah, they used to launch right there. It became a lot more popular after we left there. It was more commercialized, and more people were going after we left there.
Although there were some stupid people who came in there. One of--did I forget---?--- came in. ---?--- came running up to the office and he said, "---?--- Do you know where there are any quick, quick mine claims?" I said, "I think I know where there's one right now if we can go stake it." He said, "Go stake it, I'll hold this gun." I got my gloves on and went down to Red Canyon. I got a--hell, I didn't even have a ---?--- I got old Clod, a tape measure, and we
staked off a claim. We came back and you know, this
guy had never seen me. I walked in and said,
see this, a good claim." We sold it to that guy for $250 right there, just--

Yeah, well I guess it was probably later during the boom; people talk about the big corporations trying to put stock deals together and they'd go out and they didn't care what they were just so they had those X number claims.
Would you like to buy some of that stock? Y ou've got some?
Yeah.
We had all sorts of stock like that.
We had some pretty good money on some of that stock. Oh, we didn't on some of those penny stocks. You made--what was it you sold them for?
Yeah, we got some real valuable stock. We got 10,000 shares of Utah-Idaho, which started when the uranium started.

That was kind of a gig they were pulling on some of that.

jump in there and sell.

Well, we went to--there was another fellow and myself that went down; I don't know how I got that stuck, we went down to the Court Hotel one night, this Roy Hall was a real good friend of mine, but he was a mining engineer, metallurgy engineer too. We went down to visit with this old boy. His name was Lester Harris and he has since been killed. He gave us--heck, we had 300 shares of that--
Federal.
Federal Uranium, which ran up to $11. Then we got 500 shares of Radial Rock--
10,000 shares of this. We just went down and visited with him and got a nice duck dinner.

Well, the old Court Hotel has been torn down since then. But this was on the corner down there and they had a bar down in the bottom called the Snake Pit.
In 1952 to '53 there were promoters all over this place you know. Well, we worked in Denver in a plant out there called the Atomic Energy Commission and everybody was bringing in real good samples, you see. So maybe four or five of us would decide we'd like to have a few drinks. Say it was my night to be the pigeon. I wouldn't go home and change my clothes but the rest of the guys go with their clothes on and they would go down in this bar, get a table and they'd say, "Well, he'll be in pretty quick." He'll walk in with a whole bunch of nice rocks you see and say, "Well, there they are." Then these promoters will start coming in and they'll say, "Can we buy you fellows a beer?" "Well, no, no. Well, alright, one." You sit there all night, you see, and you never buy another drink. They all want to know where this came
49

 LEONARDO. DAVIS jl
from. Well, now these guys are---?--- for his gold. You sit there all night and you know you want a drink and then go home and they didn't. You say, "I'll see you fellows again." Then you know we got all our rocks from out there by those little plants. People bring them here. It was something again. People sell the stocks to one another. But at White Canyon you didn't have any of that business.
MD: No.
LD: You just had--and when you went in there did you go
in Blanding? SS: Y eah.
MD: You went by Blanding.
LD: Below; [I've] forgotten when this was. Now this, you
know that Moenkopi formation? Do you remember as you're going down the road whether this looks like a regular vein through there or the red has been leached out of that danged iron ore, iron rock? If you're--
ss: When you're already down past the mine?
LO: Yeah, just, I think--no, just past the mine. on the
road through. SS: Oh yeah.
LD: This had a red and white vein through there. There wasn't a week that went by that we didn't get a
50

 LEONARD 0 . DAVIS #1
sample of that. We'd say, "Now we can tell you right where we got it." Well, then they'd want one of the samples. Everyone staked that dang thing.
For uranium.
There is a--did you see copper down there? That was below the mine between the mine and the mill. It's a
MD: LD:
SS:
LD:
MD: LD:
small vein of copper. It's below the Apple Jack, it's below the Apple Jack going down towards the mine. It's pretty good copper silica there. Somebody was talking to me about mining that not too long ago. You know shipping it for the silica, and that would pay for the freight on the copper. But I don't know whether they've opened that up or not.
No. You know they had that copper leaching plant and did some copper mining up behind---?--- Elk Ridge.
Oh yeah, this was the guy out of--oh hell, you know who I'm talking about. His boys got blown up over there at Little Hat, a little place over there on the other side of Mexican Hat. We went to their house one time.
Yes, up at---?--- I can't remember that.
Yeah, they had a nice place. Then there was another little copper leaching outfit over there. Well, this
guy worked for me. He's been to see me a dozen times in the last five years. Not here at the house, but at
51

   LEONARD 0. DAVIS #1
the office. Yeah, weс know these people. This fellow's two boys tried to blast some pieces and blew themselves up over at what place did you say that was?
MD: I didn't.
LD: Bluff, yeah, Bluff.
MD: Bluff, Utah, though, dear.
LD: Uh huh. And there are some interesting characters,
especially if you get a chance, you visit with old
Fletch Bronson. Now he's a pretty good old man.
ss: Well, I called and he's the father, isn't he?
LD: Uh huh.
SS: Yeah, I called up but he didn't want to talk.
LD: He didn't?
SS: No. You know sometimes you talk about just coming
from college and so forth; people, if they don't, have a chance to meet you just over the phone, they're not too anxious to get to know you.
LD: Well, Mrs. Cooper was pretty--well, I don't know, but I always was well acquainted with those people. They always seemed to me that they'd be better.
SS: Well, now one of the other girls though, did make an appointment to talk to Grant and to Mrs. Cooper, only she's not Mrs. Cooper anymore.
LD: No, she lives in Moab I think. Doesn't she? 52

 LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
ss: I'm not sure where they located her. LD: Yeah, I think she lives in Moab.
ss: But we had eighteen people--
MD: Oh.
SS: --last summer and some of us stayed in Blanding and worked, you know, out from Blanding and some went up to Moab and one man--well, a couple that were
interested in the stocks and the legal aspects went to Salt Lake City and so we had--
LD: Did you have anybody around Naturita and over in that area?
SS: One of the guys went over just briefly. I'm headed for Naturita Monday.
LD: Are you?
SS: Y eah.
LD: I mined in that area before they knew what uranium
was worth.
SS: Well, you know what? I was going to say.
LD: I mined vanadium.
ss: We ought to--you've had a long history in uranium.
I'd like to go back before you came to White Canyon and talk about some of the things you did and some of the things you've done since then, too.
(END OF FIRST HALF OF INTERVIEW]

    THE FOLLOWING I S THE SECOND HALF OF AN
LEONARD O. DA VIS, CONDUCTED BY SUZANNE
GRANDE, ARIZONA, ON JANUARY 2 2 , 1 9 7 1 . MRS. DA VIS I S ALSO PARTICIPATING IN THE INTERVIEW. [THIS IS PART OF THE UTAH URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT. TAPE #2.]
MD: Well oh, wasn't it, yes, before they found that uranium was in vanadium?
LO: Before they ever had uranium, I mined vanadium. Now do you know where Paradox is at?
SS: On the map. I haven't been there.
LO: A lright, well you' 11 probably go through Paradox.
When I first started mining there was the old Radium King. There was a fellow by the name of K. N. Jaroard who's up here in Scottsdale.
ss: I talked to him yesterday. MD: Oh you did?
LD: Do you know him?
SS: Y eah.
LO: Alright, did he name the old Radium King mine over there?
SS: He didn't say.
LD: Well, he didn't, you know.
ss: Well, he said that he came to Naturita from Peru when
VCA bought the old Standard-- LD: Yeah.
SS: --Chemical holdings, and I guess the mill there and so forth. But he didn't mention that mine.
LD: He also promoted that Monticello plant.
INTER VIEW WITH SIMON AT CASA

 LEONARD 0 . DAVIS #1
SS: Yeah, we talked about that.
LO: Yeah. Alright now when he was doing this you see, I
--?--- this Radium King on the edge of Paradox. He and I were partners. I was doing the mining. I stayed by myself out there. I'd get up in the morning and I'd go down to the mine and I drilled around and blasted around and I'd knock it out and then I'd come back up that cabin and I'd cook sometimes eating buckskin and beans. Then he'd come in there, but he wouldn't ever come right down to the mine. He'd fix me a nice steak, good dinner, a couple of drinks, turn right around and lie to me and back to Denver he'd go and I'd go back to the hole. Yeah. But you did interview him in Scottsdale?
SS: Y eah.
LD: He's got emphysema now.
SS: Y eah.
LD: Uh huh. Well, he's had kind of a colorful career. But
this, you know he didn't get paid for the uranium.
All he got was a-- MD: V anadium.
LD: Vanadium. But at this time too I do know, and I won't mention any names 'cause I could get myself in trouble. There were people, very prominent people who
were buying uranium from the vanadium that was being 55

   LEONARD 0 . DA VIS # 1
hydrated and sold. Probably you've run onto this in your research.
Y eah.
SS: LD:
SS: LD:
SS: LD:
SS: LD:
You probably know the individual. This did happen, but as far a we were concerned all we got was the vanadium.
That's all . .
---?---
Uh huh. This was it. At the same time I had a brother
that worked there. He was over there at La Sal Creek. He worked there too at this time. Then I left there. Was that the first mining that you had done?
Oh no, no, no. I had worked in--well, I started in 1934 in T elluride, Colorado.
Gold?
Well, gold, silver; actually I was working in a plaster outfit up there which was at that time known as San Juan Metal, and I worked in the summer and went to school in the wintertime. Then I went to-- well, I ran around quite a little bit there for a
while. I went to Arizona, I came to Arizona for about six months, then went back to Colorado, and then that's when I worked for Jaroard up there in the mines. Then I worked around there at various--you know, here a little while, there a little while at these mines. Then I came back to Morenci, Arizona and
56

 LEONARDO. DAVIS il
I worked for a mill over there. I was working on - fact is I started, I was on the shift when they started the first 25 total plant over there.
SS: Now who owns that?
LD: That's Philips-Dodge Corporation. Then I was there
until the war started and then I went into the service. The when I came back from the service I started a drugstore and a pool hall and several different things.
MD: We made beans, then we went back to mining.
LD: Well, we bought a little drugstore with a hotel attached to it, and this wasn't too fair. Then I got to running a poker table in the back end with a pool
table.
MD: Illegally.
LD: Well, everybody knew it was there. They just didn't say anything. Then we sold it, we sold the drugstore to this man here and got out from under this drugstore and Hotel and moved and started running nothing but a pool room, a pool hall.
ss: What town was this?
LD: Norwood, Colorado.
ss: Oh, Norwood.
LD: I got so tired of that pool hall that you know my
best friend would walk in and I'd say, "I wonder what 57

   LEONARD 0. DAVIS #1
the hel1 he wants." So one day I just sold that for half of what it was worth. I talked it over with Jean and I decided to plant beans.
That was during the Pinto bean boom.
MD: LD:
MD: SS: LD:
I was going to be the bean tycoon of Colorado. Instead of just leasing one ranch, I went and got three.
[to the interviewer] How about coffee?
No, thank you.
I'd sit around, you know, and I will admit I'd never felt better in my life. I'd get up in the morning and I'd sit on that plow till midnight. Didn't I? And it worked real good. I worked hard, felt good. Planted those beans and they came up. They were about two and a half, three inches high, beautiful rows of them. So I went out there one morning and I see one of these had turned white and then down here another one turned white. I thought, "Well, what the hell." So-- -?--- the rest of them are really going to go. Boy, and then did the cutworms clean me out. So then I
went back to the mines to pay off my bills which took us about three years. [I've] been there ever since. That was in Naturita.
MD:
LD: Yeah, that was in Naturita. I went to work for the
Vanadium Corporation in Naturita. I went to work as a 58

 LEONARD 0 . DA VIS # 1
laborer. Then I went--I'd already had electrical training in the Navy. So I went to work as an electrician. Then when I went to White Canyon, I went to work as a foreman with Mr. ---?---, which he was. He was a real good man, real good. Then I stayed there with him until I could see where this advancement with this ion exchange was going to be really the thing. I quit a salary job and went to work for $1.62 an hour in Grand Junction just to get this. Well, I didn't work there very long for
$1.62 and then I got a raise and I was made a foreman, general foreman over the pilot plant. I worked there until 1956 and then I came to Tuba City
with El Paso Natural Gas. We were there until three years ago.
It was uranium too.
MD:
LD: It was uranium. it was all uranium. Then we were
there until three years ago and then I came here. We've been here ever since. From here we don't know where we're going. We are in a quandary. We aren't going to sell this house and we're not buying any furniture. We're going to move. We're definitely going to move. We know that. See, they just sold this
property that we have. ---?--- took over half of it.
Which . So consequently I've got a little ---?---
59

    LEONARD 0 . DA VIS #1
office down here, myself and Jim Snyder. I go down about 8:30 every morning, open the mill, come home, and that's about the size of it.----?----. I believe that pretty well covers about what I've done.
MD: If she's going to Naturita, is Vera Ray still there? LD: I don't know whether Vera Ray's still there or not. But there are some very funny things in that town. I
think by talking to you, you're no prude, I mean as far as you can see the funny side of life. I don't know whether this place is still there yet or not. The Tumble Inn?
SS: Oh yeah, the Tumble Inn and fall out.
LD: Well, there is more to this that you think. The
Tumble Inn is down this way, and it was built out you see, but as you come around here then it goes to the river. No street lights. So everybody goes in there and drinks beer. Especially if you watch this, this is a comedy at night. You watch when strangers come to town. They go in and they drink beer until finally they just have to go to the bathroom. They come out here and you can't see off here so they step around
the building and then crash. MD: In the river.
LD: About 50 feet down on into the river. You know, you could be polite and say, "Hey fellow, don't do that."
60

  LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
But you don't. Then here he comes back up from he creek, all torn to hell, but he doesn't say nothing, and the next guy he--
SS: He's not going to admit that.
LD: You watch for that place when you go. I hope they
haven't built in--
MD: I'm afraid that it's not there.
LO: This used to be a comedy. You see, that had a light over it, but you couldn't see beyond there and they'd just step off in the dark and crash, down off that h1с11 they'd go. That count ry ' s got a--
MD: Coal mining.
LD: Mining ---?---. We went to ---?--- one time, these
flat tops. You asked what flat tops are, here I'11 show you. We lived inside those. One time the cops and game warden came in there and they blocked this thing off and they started their search party.
MD: For venison.
LO: For venison, and, gosh you would see here were dogs
carrying nice venison roasts.
MD: Out the window. Everybody was getting rid of it.
LO: You know, dogs going by with a nice piece of
venison.
MD: Or they ---?--- Remember the little redhead kept
the--oh, she was really a flirt, she kept the deputy 61

  LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
standing out front while her friend was chopping up this roast that had been cooking and flushed it down the toilet.
Yeah, and Ed Bracket's wife went to bed with their venison.
Yeah, and--
Yeah, you can't bother women in bed.
They couldn't get a doctor's certificate to search the bed.
But you could see dogs going around there with big shanks of meat. The manager there, this manager was a kind of an oddball. He decided to throw one guy out because he had bed bugs. Well, he didn't have nothing
LD:
MD: LD: MD:
LD:
MD: LD:
.else to do.
We didn't like the manager.
We didn't like the manager. So we got up a petition said, "We don't think this man has had bed bugs and he's got no right to throw him out." And gosh, they didn't throw him out either. They did a lot of spraying, but they never did throw him out. I don't
know whether he had bed bugs or not. That was quite an odd little community to live in too. Right there, but you'11 see that one. In Naturita when we were there, there was no law whatsoever in there.
You mean as far as police force.
MD:
62

  LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
LD: MD:
LD:
MD:
LD:
MD:
LD:
SS: LD:
No police force or nothing. No patrolmen, nothing.
No, we didn't have any--well, we did too. We had the deputy down White Canyon, but he was running off with the other guy's wife.
Well, he's the one I'd take his badge off from him. Yeah, boy he was full of it.
You're on T.V. and so forth.
Oh, I'd better not say it.
People could get hurt on that thing, but Naturita is a real nice place. It's been a very interesting--
It's got a lot of history.
It's got a lot of history in that. Uravan, it's a little bit different, but. Naturita, it was a fine place to live too. I remember when I first went there I stayed at a restaurant and (there] was a fellow by the name of Fred Ernest. How he wore his hat. You know how they used to wear hats with a crease down like that with two little wings up on there?
Y eah.
Then there was an old German Cook in there and I don't know, I was in there eating in that restaurant. Fred came in and they started arguing over $2. That old cook turned around and picked up a cleaver and he
swung that little critter but he just got the two de- le-bops on his hat against the wall and cut that off.
63
SS: LD:

    LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
Old Ernie, he was just like the guy with the boiler, he just--
ss: He was glad to leave.
LD: Yeah, but there are some funny people. You can visit
MD:
LD: SS: LD: SS:
with a lot of people around there and have a good time. If you want to see the funny side of their life, and there have been some good ones around those areas. Vera, I don't think he would break out and tell her all this stuff.
No, I don't think he would either. He won't, he wouldn't--
But you are going to spend time over there?
Y eah.
Well, which way are you going to go in there?
I haven't decided yet. The Woodsville Automobile Club there in California, they said the best road was to go up from Dove Creek, but Ken George yesterday suggested that I go in from Monticello.
LD: Well, it's the same way.
ss: Well, isn't there a road that is--well yeah, yeah it
is, but I mean going through Cortez and up rather than going--I'm not too sure.
MD: Oh, yes, if she goes . . ---?---
LD: Some people, if you want to take some notes on some people that I think would be real interesting to--
64

   LEONARD 0. DAVIS #1
SS: Okay, you bet.
LO: Mrs. Columbo that runs the Paradox store. MD: Yeah, if she's still there.
LO: She has been there for years and years and years. Also in Paradox is a fellow by the name of Chet Wagoner, if he's still alive now. Now these people
SS: LD:
SS:
are old timers; they can tell you seeing the uranium come and go. Chet Wagoner would be in Paradox. ---?-- - in the town, old man Blake isn't alive anymore. There's no chance of him being alive. I don't know about--in Naturita, you can either see Jim or Maggie Jacobson.
Okay.
---?--- the post office, old Jim Jacobson. Now these people I think might be able to give you an interesting outline.
Somewhere, maybe, I've got a list of people that I had on paper that I was still, you know, hoping to find. Maybe you might know where some of them are now.
LO: You see, I was born and raised in Norwood. That's where Jean and I both come from.
ss: Is that right? W ell, I figured that there are probably as many people around in Norwood now with a mining background as maybe--
65

   LEONARDO. DAVIS #1
LD: Yeah, I'll tell you, I don't think about that I know.
---?--- those kids go over there and---?--- in the
daytime. MD: Uh huh.
LD: And Lehi Foster that's in Monticello. Isn't that right? Yeah, I think that--Billy Kyle is in Grand Junction. Billy Kyle used to be the chemist down at, not Grand ,Junction, Nucla. Nucla, Colorado. Monument Fred, I think is dead. He ought to be anyway. Conwell, Mr. and Mrs. Conwell. Now that's some
people. This is a lady and a man that worked here for
me. He's a carpenter.
SS: Oh yes, yes, yes.
LD: Man, I ain't got the least idea. Oh, Mr. Robert
Miller. There's a Mr. and Mrs. Robert Miller. They are right down here in Tucson. He works for Anaconda and his name is Bob Miller.
MD: Oh, Bob Miller, oh yes.
LD: The one with the beard.
MD: Yes, I remember, I'd forgotten.
LD: Hell, we get a Christmas card--he worked for me.
MD: There was just that one couple.
LD: Joe Follie. This is one of the old timers I was
telling you about. I don't think he's around anymore. L. H. Redford, I know isn't around. He got killed.
66

  LEONARDO. DAVIS #1 MD: He was killed.
LD: Mr. and Mrs. Laurel Rogers, Mr. and Mrs. Walt Seeger. Seeger, that rings a bell somewhere. Who was he? Janus Stoker, do you remember him?
MD: Oh yes, yes.
LD: Yeah, I haven't got the least. ---?---. He married
Vera Rays's wife's sister's daughter. That's right. She married Woodrow Ray. Yeah, Stoker, I haven't got the least idea where. Herb Weber, you see, he was in the mine. He worked for Joe Cooper. Then Mr. and Mrs. Willingword, and here's Dr. John Williamsen. I think he's dead, but if he isn't he would be down around that White Canyon somewhere.
MD: I would imagine, I don't know.
ss: Well, he probably is dead then because nobody around
there knew him and I asked them.
MD: I would say in his middle sixties.
LD: He'd be 8o something years old. I doubt very much
that the old man--
ss: And if he was in poor health then--
LO: Well, he really wasn't in poor health as far as
physically was concerned, he was a little confused 67
LD: Well, because see that
talking, that old man was--hell, he was sixty something years.
---?--- the way we were

   LEONARD 0 . DA VIS # 1
mentally, but he had this little fixation about his wife that he'd been cheated. But she came out there and saw him and she was a good looking gal and he had two daughters and a son, and they came out and saw him. They were real nice people, but I mean--that's about all I can help you with on them. Did you find Dave Giles?
SS: LD: MD: LD: SS: MD: LD:
I found him. He wouldn't talk to me.
He wouldn't? The eccentric old buzzard.
I wouldn't doubt that in the slightest.
He didn't talk to you at all?
No. He turned me down cold. In fact, he got mad. That makes me real upset. I don't doubt it. Durango, was he in Durango?
SS: No, no, I guess he spends his winters in--
LD: No, he's----?----.
ss: He was in the Westward Ho Hotel in Phoenix. I talked
to Fendell Sitton there in Phoenix.
LD: We know that Fendell Sitton was there. The other
night, it was the metallurgist--
