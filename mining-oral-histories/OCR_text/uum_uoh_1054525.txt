 THIS INTERVIEW WITH KENNETH BEACH FOR THE COLORADO PLATEAU URANIUM PROJECT WAS TAPED ON AUGUST 1 2 , 1 9 7 0 . THE INTERVIEWER I S STEVE GUTTMAN.
SG: As an introduction to the tape, could you give a little background on yourself? When did you first come here?
KB: I am a native here. Yeah, I'm getting to be one of the oldest natives around here that was born here in Moab. My mother was born here. I was born in 1912. And I lived here all my life, never have ever left from the time I was born. What else do you want to know?
SG: Well, when did you first start working for the city?
KB: Oh, well, I was--I went to work for the county here. I was elected in 1963, been here ever since in the assessors office. I had a bread route during the boom. When I first took it over, I was having to go to Monticello, along to Dove Creek to make a living. And six
months after the uranium boom, why, I had all I could do right here in Moab and made about three times as much money. So you can see the difference in the population from the time, that was in 1953 that I took over the bread route. By 1954, why, I was--and into 1962, I run that bread route, and I'll tell you, and then in 1962 it started dropping off again. Then in '63 people come to me and wanted me to run for this office; I don't know why, but I did. So i've been in here ever since. And then--
well, like some of these figures here. Like I said, in 1950 there was 10 trailers in Grand County, and by 1960--

 KENNETH BEACH 111
in 1962 there was 1,404.
SG: That's quite a substantial--
KB: That's quite a substantial gain. Then, then it started to
decline after that. In '63 there was 1,156; and last year there was 764. So it's kind of leveled off, and it's been staying about the same since in '62 after that big deal then with potash when they was building it. And then it might be interesting here on the housing; between 1950 and 1960 there was 1,320 new homes built here, and that was related to the uranium boom.
SG: Right.
KB: Then it might be interesting here to note the assessed
valuation of Grand County before and after the boom. When I started in 1952, the assessed valuation was 2 million, and then in 1956 it had jumped to 5 million.
SG: You can't blame that all on inflation.
KB: No, that was the uranium boom. That's what it was. And
then in 1959 it was up to 6 million, up to 11 million. Then in 19-- in the year I come in here, it jumped to 7,683,000. And today it's--this is just Grand County what I assessed, you understand. I mean this isn't the whole-- I'm giving you the jump from the locally assessed valuation. Now it's pretty near 10 million from 1970, but it jumped--the whole assessed valuation is up to 23 million and it was 11 million in 1954 before the uranium
~I

 KENNETH BEACH 111
boom, so it's fairly well doubled since then. So uranium, you might say, made Moab and Grand County. There's no doubt about it. And then you might say Charlie Steen was ---?--- between him and Mr. Bodily. Of course, Mr. Bodily's been in it for a lot of years.
Yeah.
Even before--I think what's-her-name contacted him,
SG: KB:
SG: KB:
SG:
didn't she?
That's what I understand.
Yeah, I think she did when she come in here to get that first uranium mine. But he'd been a firm believer in it a long time. But it took Charlie to strike that big Mi-Vida mine down there, really get it to go over.
Before going into the role of the assessor, can you go a little bit into the problems you had with the bread company? I didn't realize, you know--We've talked to some of the merchants to try to get this side of the picture too.
Well, yes. At first, this Wholesome Bread Company, they were the first ones. They would come through here. They had it into Durango and Cortez, see. They'd just kick off a few cases of bread here; in front of the two stores is all we had at that time. And they'd just leave it there and we'd have to put it on the shelves ourself and everything else. Of course, before the boom really got
KB:

 KENNETH BEACH 111
started, why, things were starting to pick up a little around here so they did put on this bread route. I never had the first one, but they then got to having this route, but then they had to go plum to Dove Creek, work Dove Creek, Monticello, and Blanding, and everything, the guy did, which is a lot of miles. I think, don't remember how far it is to Dove Creek, but it's--
SG: It's almost a two hour drive.
KB: Yeah, it's a good two hour drive. And so then, course,
there got to be more stores down here, and then, of course, he was competing with Wonder Bread. And when I took it over, they had the bulk of the business here because they had a fellow here all the time. But then when I come back, got to working, took it over, and got to working here steady, why, the first big problem with the stores was getting your, ---?--- was getting the best positions. But then, of course, ---?--- I just had to start branching out now like Miller's Supermarket, and until the market came in, like Bruce McCormick. He was in the uranium business in Dove Creek, and he come over and built him a store. So it got to be big business, that bread business. And then you had to get up at four o'clock in the morning to start; that's what got me off
of it. I had done that ten years. SG: That gets old after a while.

 KENNETH BEACH f/1
KB:
---?---. But I never knew anything about this deal when I came in here. I never realized quite how, what a complicated outfit it was till I got in here. So I practically had to go to school again---?---. Of course, I worked for the power company too, for Utah Power and Light Company when they just had this little old one horse power plant up here. I don't know whether you ever knew anything--
You worked with Mr. Holt then?
Yes, he was my boss for ten years when they had that
little old thing. I guess he told you about that . . ---?---
We practically had to make parts for it. Of course, then when that boom come in, with that machine that was there, why, it wouldn't even pull the street lights now. So they had to run this line in here, but--
What made you decide to give up the job at Utah Power and Light and transfer to the bread?
Well, see--
More money?
They tore the plant down, see. They gave me a job up to Orem, so I moved out and went to Orem and stayed there two months. I wouldn't have lived up there if they
would've given me the power plant. I didn't like it. I was Moab born and raised. I remember it was on Thanksgiving Day I come home and my wife with me up there

 KENNETH BEACH 111
in a little old apartment, and I told her, I said, "Well, I never heard of anybody starving to death yet down in Moab, so I'm going home. Are you going with me?" She said, "I thought you'd never say". So that's when I come back. And I was setting in the barber shop down here and I had a job. This fellow that was running a temporary newshouse at Grand Junction, and he was wanting to get rid of it. He was getting a haircut and he was wondering if anybody knew of anybody that was ---?---. And I just happened to be sitting here, and I said, "Hell yes. I'11 take---?---".
SG: That's how you got in business.
KB: That's how I got in the bread businessе I was just
looking for a job then, but this was really an experience. Now I'll tell you, you have to be a politician to run a business. So I didn't have much trouble---?------?--- ten years.
SG: I guess the competition in pretty heavy.
KB: Yeah, it is in that. You be your life. You have to be--
you have to treat everybody just like you was looking for their hope when you try to sell them a loaf of bread because there wasn't that much difference in the bread. Bakery bread is all bakery bread. The whole deal was the
promotion interest and your ability to sell your bread. SG: What happened to the other part of your route then when
6

 KENNETH BEACH 111
Moab became---?---
KB: We11, they put a route in Montice11o, and then to Blanding, and then Dove Creek.
SG: One route, San Juan County and the other route was---?-- -?
KB: That's right. They just made a whole new route up there. It just got so by the time I'd go, even before I could talk them into changing--time I load up here and I'd go over there and get back, he11, my racks wou1d be empty see. I just couldn't--there wasn't no way I could keep up with it, you know. And they still wanted--so I gave them two weeks notice. I told them, I said, "Well, if you 're not going to let me take care of this, I'm going to quit because I'm not about to do it this way." Well, so the big shot come down and it didn't take him very long. He
said, "You make one more trip and that's all you have to make," after he seen the situation. So then I just ran Moab, and I run it for nine years here.
SG: Do you know what the volume was during the boom? At least approximately what it would be?
KB: Well, I know my part of it. I was making $320 a week, and when I started out I was making 75. So you can see what the uranium boom done to the--
SG: Yeah. That's---?---. That's a pretty good size one.
KB: Yeah that's what I say. It was all due to uranium now. It
7

 KENNETH BEACH /11
was the uranium boom. No doubt about it. When I started
out, I had a little old ton truck, and when I left I had a two ton truck with a great big bed on it. On weekends I had to store some of my bread, see. I couldn't get it all in that big truck even. So, I'm telling you, all along you'd start at four o'clock in the morning, and it would be around six at night, but you was making pretty good money for them in them days. But it was good money anytime, as far as that goes.
SG: It's plenty now.
KB: You really earn it, I mean. It was hard work. But it is
fell back down now. The big trouble is these stores have all put in bakeries. And that's really where your money was, was in that bakery stuff. During all this work here, they used to have those little ten cent items prepackaged, see. And there was so many lunches being made and taken at that time, boy, I really made a lot of
money on that pastry. Now with the stores having their own bakeries, it's really cut into your profit. Because I was talking to this kid that's running this now, and I think he's making $175.
SG: So it's about half of what you were making. KB: It's about half of what I was--
SG: ---?---
KB: Yeah. And so you can see it's making a lot of difference,
8

 KENNETH BEACH 111
and then these--I don't know how these cafes are now. I haven't paid too much attention, but I used to sell them everything after I finally got the business away from Wonder Bread. I had a heck of time doing that, but after I finally took it over, why, they were buying all of these, ---?--- Parkerhouse rolls and everything from me. But I think most of these cafes now bake their own, even their own rolls and stuff like that. There were none of them doing that here, and very few of them was doing any baking. I'd sell them pies and everything because they
just weren't equipped to do it. That hit 'em--hit them cafes just like it did everybody else, and they just weren't equipped for doing it. I remember when this Orchard Cafe was going over here. I'd sell sheets of Parkerhouse rolls. There was seventy-two, six dozen to a sheet, and I sold them as high as eight of them sheets in one day. So you can see they were putting through an awful lot of stuff out of this cafe. Of course, it was
the only decent big cafe there was here then.
SG: Yeah, I've heard that was the best one.
KB: Yeah, it was. It was really, you know. They made more
money, but then instead of paying off, why, they partied it all up, and then they finally went broke; lost the
whole damn thing. But--
SG: When did they finally shut up, do you remember? Close
9

 KENNETH BEACH 111 down?
KB: Well, let's see. I think it was in '64. I'm pretty sure it was 1964 because I think it was a year after I come in here. They just couldn't make it. They--
SG: They kept spending like the money was still coming in before.
KB: They spent it. They'd go on long trips and leave the help to run it, and you know what that means whenever you might have good help too. When you're not there to supervise it, why--so they lost. Oh, they had it fixed up nice too. They spent quite a lot of money fixing up the cafe and everything. If they'd just stayed to run it after they got it fixed up. That uranium, I'rn telling
you, it changed the whole complexion of this little town. SG: Did the Mountain Telephone Company have--did this cause you any problems given that you had to make so many deliveries, so many stops? Did you have any problems with
this?
KB: With what?
SG: Well, the problems with the telephone company, given that you were supplying so many different places with food? Did you ever get into trouble with this?
KB: 0h, no, neverе After you'd serviced at p1aces a time or two, you knew just about what they were going to use, see. ---?--- see. Just like when I first started there,
10

 KENNETH BEACH 111
after the first two weeks I quite three times because of this ordering see. I had to send in my order a whole week in advance, see, to the bakery.
SG: That's a long time.
KB: Yeah, and of course I could call up, and in twenty-four
hours I could get service, see. I could make changes, but if something come up, why made a lot of trips to Grand junction. That's where the bakery was to supply the customers in old cars, see. To get stuff from that bakery up there because you know people, whenever they order something, why, they expect you to have it.
SG: Right. They don't care much for any excuse.
KB: No, they don't want no excuses. So if you're going to keep your business, why, that's what you've got to do. But it--it wasn't too, too bad. I'd always order a little long. If I had to throw something away, why, I figured it was better to do that, and then I never did get any static from the bakery. They were pretty good about that
unless you stales were running too good. They'd pay you for them. When I first started, you could imagine I had never done anything like that in my life. And boy, you, get up, and of course you go in there to those racks, and you've got to have some idea what you need. You don't
want to come back two days and finally you have to stale all that stuff out, see. Well, that was where we had
11

 KENNETH BEACH 111
these big racks in there. So when I first started I just fill them up, why--(Laugh)
SG: Didn't know better.
KB: No, I thought they had the rack in there, so fill it up,
see. So I'd just fill it up. But good criminy, the first time I'd go back to Dove Creek or one of these places, some of that stuff, none of it sold. It took quite a little while to get onto what was selling, and then you didn't have too much trouble ordering. But I learned a lot there that first six months because I quit five times.
(Interruption)
Now Wholesome products bakery right in Grand Junction.
They run a truck in here everyday. So you did have fresh products to sell, and that was one of the big deals that I had go in over Wonder Bread because I did have fresher things, see. That guy that was running that, he was really a promoter. It took me about a year before I--he was selling pert near all the bread, and I started just running Moab because he was here all the time, see. He had another guy that went to Monticello and Blanding and
everything, and he just worked Moab, see. So--
SG: Is he still doing it, or is he--?
KB: No, he left. He went with Clover Club Potato Chips. He's
way up in their Denver office now. He's, he's what they 12

 KENNETH BEACH 111
call, he goes around all the routes. He was really a-- he's just kind of a petty larceny. He'd try to sneak a dime, you know and lost ten dollars. If--if he hadn't been that way, he never could have--! never could have routes with him, but he couldn't resist.
SG: Easy dime.
KB: Yeah, easy dime (laughs). Of course, though, Rutherford
got kind of fed up with him, and it's quite an experience, I'll tell you. I never had thought I would be a supervisor of that power plant up there for all those years and then jump into something like that.
SG: Remember any particular instances that really stick out in your mine that happened during this boom?
KB: I don't know. Anything that was really--?
SG: What kind of problems, from your viewpoint, where the
merchants having in trying to keep their own stuff in
stock? A place like Miller's, you know, they're always--? KB: Well, I don't know, they were farsighted enough. They started building that new store over there, and they run
down this here at night on the corner for a long while. I guess you knew that. At that time I thought they were going way out on a limb when they went out there and built that big a store. But see, they been in that--they owned another route. He'd been in that business for years and years, and he was always a gambler, and he was making
13

 KENNETH BEACH 111
money in it when nobody else was because he was the gambler. Well, that's just what he done out here. He said, "Well, I'm either going to have to get out of the business or else go into it whole hog." And that's what he done. Of course, a lot of the people though he was ---?---. He never would pay out or anything else, but he didn't really have--he was very handy. He dumped a lot of it onto the salesmen now, you know, the guys that had been in the business for years and years that had been selling him goods, see. He just dumped it into his lap, "Now I want some of this. I want this kept. I want this bread, but coffee and everything else." He'd say, "I want these shelves kept full and when they get down, you send me more." So he did, he dumped a lot of it into the
people's lap that were wholesaling to him. In fact, he
still does.
SG: Made it easier or made it more difficult for you?
KB: Well, after you got onto it, it made it easier because he
gave you free hand. The only thing he didn't want to do was run out. "If you have to pick up ten cases of bread, that's your tough luck, but don't let me run out." Now that's just what he'd tell you. And if you wanted to sell him bread, and he was the big store owner, brother, you done it. Even if you had to pick up stuff. But that's the way he was, and everybody knew it, so they just acted
14

 KENNETH BEACH 111
accordingly. I mean, in the long run, he'd make you money. He was store man. And then his son took over and he's just a chip off the old block. I don't know whether you've met him or not.
SG: Yeah, we've interviewed Ralph, Jr.
KB: Not yet, we're sti11 trying. He sti11 keeps pretty
active, and it's hard to catch him too.
KB: Yeah, he's down on that ranch. He's the one you ought to
get a hold of because he's been through the mill. He started out--he'd be a good one to talk to. And he was born here too.
SG: Yeah, Ralph Jr. was, I know.
KB: Yeah, Ralph Jr. was and so was Senior. So, yeah, he'd be
a good one to get a hold of. He's home today, I know, but the best place to catch him would be down on that ranch though, or have you tried?
SG: We've tried, but you know it seems like the time he's been free is the time when I've already had something else scheduled.
KB: Yeah.
SG: But we'll get him before we leave.
KB: Oh yeah. you want to get hold of him because he'll tell
you all about this boom. He was farsighted enough to see what it was going to be, and he just stepped out there and went into it all.
15

 KENNETH BEACH 1/1
SG: Were there many local people that prospered from the
boom, or was it more outsiders like Charlie Steen?
KB: Oh, I think it was mostly outsiders. A lot of us just sit around here. We never had anything; we never knew how to go get anything, and so we sit here and let everybody else make the money, and they did. And, of course, in the long run, all the way through, it helped us. But as far as making any money out of the mines, there was a few people here that made a little money. Down in San Juan County there were some locals there that did make a lot of money. I guess you've got them, but for just anybody striking any big mines that amount to anything, why, they
didn't do it, see.
SG: Well, how about some of the businessmen then like Mr.
Miller and I know Mr. Christensen both prospered during
the boom.
KB: During the boom, yes.
SG: Were there any other ones that really had substantial
increase like they did?
KB: Well, I'll tell you, this McCormick--Bill McCormick--
SG: Right.
KB: He come over--he was just a little ole merchant there,
but he got in with Charlie though. SG: Yeah.
KB: Charlie had his drill rigged when he hit the---?---. But 16

 KENNETH BEACH #1
he come in and built this store and then now--now I think he's really--well, I know he's better off than Charlie is
now because he hung onto his money. And, of course, he did. you might say all that Valley Shopping Center over there was due to the uranium boom. Hadn't been for that, it wouldn't even be there. City Market come in here from Grand Junction, and then that Walker Drug, and--
SG: For the size of the city there is quite a bit of shopping centers here.
KB: For the size of it, yeah. I swore that when--I did the quitting when City Market come in here, and that was another thing. That kind of convinced me to get out of the bread business because I knew Ralph Miller, and I knew Wholesome in Grand Junction, see. That's where their bakery was, and that's where all the City Markets were. They really catered to City Markets over in Grand Junction, and I figured they were going to have troubles here because I knew that the minute you give City Market something that you didn't give Ralph over there, you was in trouble. So that was another thing that convinced me,
but I guess it didn't really materialize. I thought there would really be a battle there between Miller's and City Market, but they seemed to have--when they first come down there, I guess Miller's was a little bit worried about it, but evidently it seemed to be business is
17

 KENNETH BEACH 111 ---?---.
SG:
KB: SG: KB:
?L:
KB: ?L:
KB:
SG:
KB:
Yeah, Ralph Jr. said that there was more competition during the boom than there is now.
That 's right.
But---?---.
Yeah, now this Frank Yama that took over McCormick's here, I thought when City Market come, I'd give him six months and he'd be broke. Well, he went right along there
and made money right up, all the time.
Wouldn't you say that Yama pretty well was a product of
the boom---?---. We11, yes.
He came in as a jeweler and then just went from there on up.
But I didn't think he could ever make it in that store. But now, of course, Miller's has bought it. And they've got 'em both, but--
That's a pretty good size amount of property there too, so--
Yeah, see, McCormick or Steen owns all that property, and so they built the building. And Yama just--I don't think Yama ever did own the building.
SG: I think he bought it afterwards.
KB: Afterwards here about two years ago. ---?--- he bought
the building, but he went along there and made him some
18

 KENNETH BEACH 111
money though because he's not the type to not. He worked hard though: put in a lot of hours. I know now like this
SG:
KB:
SG: GB:
instant, just my own personal deal; I owned a house down here on the Main Street that didn't--wasn't much of a home, but it was a home. And I give $600 for it and the land, and I sold it during that boom for $25,000. So you see--(Laughs)
That's a pretty healthy size profit. Geez.
No, you can see what it--that it was strictly uranium boom now. That guy was a promoter. He never did do nothing with it. But I got all my money out of it. Probably not even worth that much now.
No, see, and my sister owned a salt grass pasture. It was 100 by 150, and she bought that for $250; wasn't nothing on it. And she sold it for $11,000, and Charlie Steen's mother put that ice plant on it down there, see. Well, here just lately that piece that they gave me $25,000, he sold it for $6,000. So you see--
Quite a drop.
Quite a drop, and I think that Mrs. Schumacher sold that for $2,500 which she gave $~1,000 for, so you see it was- -everybody said I was crazy for selling that at the time, that I could of held off and got more money. Well, it wasn't three months from then that you couldn't even get
that, just that much time.
SG: KB:
19

 KENNETH BEACH 111
SG: Looks like you timed it just right.
KB: I hit it exactly right when I sold because that guy was wishing I still had it. He was from Brazil. He come over here, and he was just going to do great guns. He bought a lot of property.
SG: Do you remember the gentleman's name?
KB: Uh, ain't that funny. I just about said it.
SG: Well, maybe you'11 think about it later. Did you get
involved at all in any of these penny stocks? You didn't
get involved at all? KB: No.
SG: Stayed away from it.
KB: No, the only thing--well, I kicked myself. I had a chance
to. My brother-in-law come to me. When the power company shut down, one of my brother-in-laws wanted me to put up the money to go out and stake this country, see. But he was a drunkard, and I thought he was crazy, and I didn't do it. Well, it was right out in the same country where
Steen made all this money.
SG: Well, I guess we'11 move back into your role as the
assessor. What actually now are your duties as an
assessor in Utah?
KB: Well, in Grand County we're supposed to get every piece
of property on the tax rolls, real and personal, which is quite a job, you know. And then I have to get the rolls
20

 KENNETH BEACH 111
together and put the assessed value on them, and then turn it over to the treasurer. But there's quite a deal that goes on. Your personal property is your big problem in here; getting it on the edge. You've got your real estate tied down; you can't move a house and the land. But these trailers are your headache in the assessor's office especially the way it has been here in Moab. You assess on the first of January, and, of course, you're
supposed to collect the money the day you assess them. But then if you want to get killed, you try to do that. So then there's a lot of people that pay their taxes regardless, and then there's others that might stay here three months and then move on you, you see. So, of course, you don't have--I get on the fight at times, but then when you stop to think of them, you've got a thousand trailers, and you actually maybe only lose four or five out of that. That's pretty good percentage in any business. Sometimes we always have about fifty or maybe even a hundred that you have a battle with every year to get it. Why, a lot of trailer people think they shouldn't pay taxes. Now I don't know, I still can't understand the thinking on it, but they just think that's their home but
not enough so that they should have to, you know, pay taxes on it. Then there's your car which has to have personal property tax paid on it every year. The assessor
21

 KENNETH BEACH 111
has to do that, collect the taxes and all on the vehicles in the county before they can buy their license of course. So you've got those tied down pretty good. ' They can't get a license until they have a tax claim, and so therefore that is not too big a problem. But you see, they don't have to license these trailers. So you've got to go out and find them and assess them just like you would the rest of the property. But they're so darn-- they can be gone; be there Monday and the next day they can be gone. We don't really lose too many, but that is your headache. And then, course, now like Colorado; there's not a sheep left in Grand County. There's not an owner that's got sheep, yet we have around sixty thousand head of sheep come in here out of Colorado around a half a year, see.
SG: Winter grazing?
KB: Winter grazing, so then you've got to collect taxes for
the amount of time those sheep are in here~ That sounds like it would be quite a problem, but it isn't really. I mean they're pretty honest. We sent them a statement, and they give pretty good, real good. One year we sent a man out to count them, and when he got through, I think it was either six or eight head less when he counted them than we did the ones they sent in, see. So, we quit that
old racket.

 KENNETH BEACH 111
SG: We'll take your word on it now.
KB: Take your word on it. But then, of course, now we've got the BLM. They work with us pretty good too. They have a record, they're the one that comes in here, see. So they don't have much trouble there. And then, of course, the state assesses all mines, utilities, and oil.
SG: So you don't have to worry about that?
KB: So I don't have to worry about thatе Now 1ike the
SG: KB:
drilling rigs and stuff like that you got to get. Now see in Utah everything is set on the first of January. Anything that's here in your possession the first of January you have to pay taxes on for that year. So sometimes you have a little trouble there. Those drill rigs will be in here--
December 31?
And then they might be gone in a week, see. So if you don't get them--and I've got called some quite bad names because I insisted on them paying right then. And if they don't, why, I put a seizure notice on them, you know. We can sell them. So I've been told off a time or two on that. But I've always gotten taxes. Some people are
honest, but one dishonest one makes it rough on all the rest of you. But I'm pretty fair with them. If they 're not going to be in here the full year, I don't charge them for the full year. So the biggest part of them that
23

 KENNETH BEACH 111
come in here, you don't have any trouble with after they've been here once, you know. And then you've got to keep up all the names when they change--when any piece of property changes hands, see. Of course, you've got to keep on top of that all the time or you're going to be in trouble. Like when somebody sells, it's supposed to have been done in the Recorder's office. But we do most of it in here, so we know very well whether it's done. When somebody comes in and says where's my piece of property, why, you've got to know that he owns and where it's at~ But it isn't nearly as thankless a job as it may seem, you know. I enjoy it because I like to meet people, but you know taxes. There is a sore subject to anybody. I don't like them, and neither do you or anybody else, but it's a necessary evil. So if you treat people half way
decent, why, they'll know they've сgot to pay them.
SG:с But they don't blame you personally.
KB: Some of them do, and some of them don't. But then, it's a
lot in the way you treat people. I found that out in the years that I've been in here. You can have a real mad person come in here, but if you can try to keep your temper and kind of explain it to them because the biggest part of them don't have the slightest idea what they're being taxed for or anything. And if you can get somebody calmed down and explain it to them, why, nine out of ten
24

 KENNETH BEACH 111
of them will go away, you know. The might not like it, but they're not really mad at you. But as you know, then trend is just up, up, up. I don't know what we're going
to do. I do know what's causing it, and that's the schools. One of these days they're going to have to find some way to level this off now. I don't know anyway they can do it.
SG: Have the state pick up part of the tab.
KB: Yeah, they're going to have to pick up more of it someway
because, like I say, every dollar I take in here, we just ship seventy-five cents of it right over to the school district. So whenever you're giving seventy-five cents out of a dollar to one taxing unit, that's the only way you're going to get any relief. Run them cheaper or get some help from somewhere. But the run of the mill people don't know that. They'll come in here, you know, and now like the county's mill levy last year was eleven mills.
That's eleven dollars out of every thousand assessed valuation. The schools was forty-three, but yet they'll come in here to the budget hearing for the local county, and just scream their heads off, see. If they cut the
whole thing off, they wouldn't cut their taxes.
SG: More than ten percent.
KB: No, see, to amount to nothingе Yet they don't say
anything. They just figure that whatever the schools say, 25

 KENNETH BEACH 111
evidently it's right. But yet you can't get people up in arms over the school budget because I have tried it. And I even went into the Treasurer's office, and I come up with where they had a hundred thousand dollars above what they set their budget. They set it low on the assessed valuation, so they had a hundred thousand dollars over. And I had it where you could prove it, and I went to all the business places to give them a copy of it. Told them when the meeting was going to be. "You bet we'11 be there. We'll be there." So, I go to the meeting and I'm the only one there, not a one--not a soul shows up. So I get told off real quick. I mean, they get above your head. You don't realize, I think that's the biggest trouble. People don't know what a school budget is. I certainly didn't. And when I go again--I went up there
with this money, but they got to talking per unit and everything else, and I was lost in ten minutes. So, I didn't know. They give me to understand the school never did have too much money. Admitted they had this hundred thousand dollars, but they had places to spend it. So I figured right then that it's going to take more. Why those guys didn't come, all these business people which
should have been really interested in where their money is going, see, but come to find out they said that's the practice. They always do that so they'll have this extra
26

 KENNETH BEACH 111
money. It states right in the book that it's strictly
against the law. If they have any money over their budget, they've got to hold another budget meeting, hearing before they can spend that money. And they even admitted that to me after the board meeting.
SG: It still goes on.
KB: It still goes on. So you can see that that's where your
troubles are. It's a cinch you've got to have schools, and taxes are going to keep going up because them teachers have got to be powerful.
SG: Well, they want a decent paycheck too.
KB: We11, yeah. I don't b1ame them for wanting a decent
paycheck, but there's got to be a stopping point. I mean, when you get to spending more money than you've got--
SG: Yeah, well, that's why I said you '11 have the state coming in more and more.
KB: Yeah.
SG: Let's go back to your own job. How many people work out
of the assessor's office?
KB: Just Herb and me.
SG: You do all the assessing yourself? KB: Yeah.
SG: Now, you didn't have any--you'd never done any work like this before?
KB: No.
27

 KENNETH BEACH 111
SG: KB: SG: KB:
How did--?
Well, I'll tell you.
It would be a rough job to learn on the job.
It was. It was, ---?--- over here, and she had worked in here only a few months. I'd been here---?--- and I know I wouldn't ever stayed here. He was commissioner and he had been in these offices, see. And boy, that first year, I just run around here. I didn't know the first thing about anything, and it was rough pal, I'll tell you.
You had no idea how complicated the job was?
Oh no, I had never even been in the office.
The incumbent, he just didn't even bother to run or--?
No, he run but everybody--I don't know. He didn't give a damn for nobody for some reason. The people were just up in arms about him because they were going to--he'd just come in here, and if you don't like it, why--
That's your problem.
That's your problem, see. And--
So this is your---?--- year, now your second term. Is that right?
Uh huh, and I run again, but nobody run against me, so I'll be--
You 're in free.
SG: KB: SG: KB:
SG: KB: SG:
KB:
SG:
KB: Yeah, for another four years, yet.
SG: Did you have opposition---?---? 28

 KEl NETH BEACH 111
KB: No, no.
SG: Just generally speaking, does the assessor's job go
unopposed because of the nature--?
KB: Oh, I think the biggest part of it does for that reason.
And if they'd ever come in--if they haven't been in here, they never come in. It's a good thing I never come in here, or I wouldn't a run for it in the first place, I'll tell you.
SG: What kind of things do y~u have to do to learn the job? KB: Well, you've got to know descriptions. I never--I went to high school, but there was a lot I didn't learn. I mean I
was more for chasing girls than for learning. When I come in here, I tell you, I didn't know nothing. Of course, I did work at it. I mean when I finally decided I was going to do it, why, I did, I did learn it. But you have to
have quite a bit of mathematics.
??: You're more long-winded than I though you were.
KB: Boy, I '11 tell you, he's got me started. (Laugh) But,
I'll tell you, the rest of the people in the courthouse can help you too. Because, you know, the biggest part of them had already been in here a lot, and so everybody was willing to help you. And then everybody in the county was so mad at the other one that you could get by with quite a bit. ---?--- the first year, and they still would give
you a chance because they were all ready to murder him. 29

 KENNETH BEACH 111
Where his big trouble was, he had those license plates he knew, and that's what he had all the people mad at him
at. For just being assessor, I think he was all right. But when he got messing with those license plates, then he spent most of his time doing those.
SG: You don't have to do that though.
KB: No, I wouldn't have because I could see where you could
really get into trouble. So, I didn't have any, and then the commissioners wouldn't let it be in here. Now I came in here because they figured that he wasn't doing either job right, see. He wasn't.
SG: So, that's a separate job.
KB: It's state, see, and this is county. And they just don't
mix. I mean, 'cause Reed was spending most of his time trying to run that license plate deal, the way it looked to me. Because and then he was in troubles because they were just starting with this addressograph. And he was trying to change over to using it too. And between that and the license plates, why, the thing was in quite a mess here. There was no doubt about it. But I'll tell you that first year when I think back on it now, I have quite
some nightmares because I don't see how I got through.
??: He was just a mite hard to live with around here.
KB: Man, I '11 tell you, it was bad. Trying to do something
when you don't know what you're doing. But one thing 30

 KENNETH BEACH 111
about it, it's an interesting job, and if you do it right, why, there's quite a lot of work to it.
As of now, though, you 're main problem is the trailers, I guess.
It is. I mean, as far as your assessing and collecting
SG:
KB:
SG:
KB:
and all that, it is your biggest headache.
Would you say that takes up more time than any other part
of the job or--?
Well, time you get them all assessed and the money
collected, why, it--well, I wouldn't say it takes that long, but it's the biggest part of your time. But when you start talking about headaches, that's the one you got because as long as people own real estate, the assessor's fine. He dumps it in the treasurer's lap, see.
Yeah.
All he does is assess it and put it on the rolls. He's got to collect the money. THe personal property, why, the assessor's got to collect the money regardless. Used to be that the first week in May you turned everything over to the treasurer. That was before I come in here, and she even had to collect on personal property, collect it.
But, of course, the legislature, they got smart upstate, which is right. The assessor assesses what he should, personal property. He should be responsible for collecting the money. But as you know, anytime you're
SG: KB:
31

 KENNETH BEACH 111
engaged in collecting money, that's where your trouble is going to be. And it doesn't make any difference what your--whether you're an assessor, whether you're a merchant, or whatever you are. Whenever you've got to get money out of people, then you've got trouble. But it isn't, you know, it's nothing that you can't--you want to get real mean. I can go out here right now, and take one of those trailers and sell 'em right out from under him, see, if they don't pay their taxes. That's being a little severe. I've never done it. I've threatened a time or two. I don't know what would happen if it come right down to it, whether I'd take somebody's trailer or not, but usually when they see you mean business, they'll go to a finance company, see.
SG: You have the authority, then, to automatically do that? KB: All I've got to do is send them a notice, and then if in five days they don't pay it, I put three notices up
around town, there's going to be a sale. It has to be
public. Somebody comes and bids, and they can buy it.
SG: Have you gone as far as putting--?
KB: Oh yeah, I have put the notices up. But right down to the
last minute, I've had them wait, and then they'll come in and they've got the money. But I just often wondered if they haven't. I've never had to really take anybody's trailer, but there's some of them I'd like to. Ones that
32

 KENNETH BEACH #1
can pay, sometimes they're toughest. These poor, some of these widow women, some of these people that are just getting by, they'll struggle along and give you five dollars at a time, but they'll pay it. But these others will make you go right to the line before they'll dig up some money when you know that they could do it if they wanted to.
What part of the job now takes about the largest part of your time?
Well, the main thing is getting your rolls ready to run. Get the plats and descriptions. There hasn't been any changes in the assessed values for so long. Of course, the state, as you know, now is going to try to bring-- well, they're not going to try, I guess they're going to do it--bring everything up to 20 percent of fair cash value.
This makes more work for you now?
SG:
KB:
SG: KB:
SG: KB:
Well, it won't be too much more work, but it will be trouble because it's going to double on some of the taxes, and when you do that, then you've got troubles.
Some unhappy people.
A lot of unhappy people. It looks to me like the only solution is that when they do that, they're going to have to put a ceiling on mill levies. Because I know and you do too that if they're left with a freehand when the
33

 KENNETH BEACH 111
valuation goes up, they'll say, "Oh goody, we've got all this much more money to spend." And if they don't drop that mill levy, why, it's just going to kill everyone, not only here, but everybody in the state. So I think they will have to make them drop the mill levy down to make up for bringing up the value. Whereas the schools, back to them again, is what's brought all this on. Some counties are paying so much more than the others, see, because no two counties in the state have got the same--
SG: No, no. There's no standard.
KB: ---?--- class value. What they're trying to do is bring
everything up equal to be assessed at 20 percent. Now some of them is down as low as 8 percent and some of them is up as high as 19 percent, see. So--
SG: What is Grand County?
KB: Well, I figure we're 18 percent on the improvements.
SG: So you're fairly high up there.
KB: But I think we're pretty good up on the improvements, but
I know we're way down on the land. But I just--I been fighting that, but when they bring the rest of them up, I'm going to have to. So it's going to double, practically double land values, I think, about 12 percent.
SG: Of course, you could start moving them up before they-- KB: Well, I have moved them up. I niean, I've doubled some.
34

 KENNETH BEACH 111
SG: Already?
KB: Already. So see, I've brought it up now t o where it might
be around fourteen, fifteen percent. But even that is
going to be quite a jump.
SG: Yeah, another five still.
KB: When you go on up to the 20 percent. But I think what the
state's going to have to do, they're going to have to ---?--- 'em all and then bring them all up at the same time because it's going to take them seven or eight years to do all the counties and bring them up to 20 percent, see. If you were the first county, they'd be saying 20 percent for maybe five years before the rest of them would be up, see. So I don't know how they're going to work that, but they're going to have trouble there. Now
the legislature has given the state more money so that they can go ahead, and I think probably they can maybe get it done. The law reads right now that every five years that state's supposed to reappraise every county in the state, but it was 1961 when they did Grand County.
SG: They haven't done it since.
KB: They haven't done it since. They did the land. They come
down here and done it '65, I think it was, along this, when Grand County went in on this. They hired a Denver outfit to come in here.
SG: Do the planning?
35

 KENNETH BEACH /11
KB: Do the planning deal. They even paid the state a thousand
dollars to come down here, so we got the--but I wouldn't go up with what they come up with. I think they were right as far as 20 percent is a fair cash value, but I wasn't going to raise up Grand County and be paying all that when I knew that Weber County was down to about 8 percent. So--
SG: The assessor's office does have quite a bit discretion then?
KB: 0h, that's right. The state tax commission is getting more powerful all the time. Now like I say they, when they know that they can't make you. They might ask you if you would go ahead and do it, so much the good. But if you don't, why, they haven't been able to get you to do it, but now--
SG: This won't change, then, as far as--?
KB: That's right, and when the state says you're going up to
20 percent, you're going up, which is all right if they will make the mill levy stay down so that taxes won't go plum out of sight, see. But now, look up in Salt Lake County at what I was just seeing. They dropped it, what was it, five tenths of a mill, the mill levy. But then you turn right around and the assessed valuation is up fifty-one million over last year's see. So, good lord, their assessed valuation is up pert near twice more than
36

 KENNETH BEACH 111
we have to start with. So they actually, get lower--
SG: Right, right.
KB: So you see what I mean. When you valuation goes up, it
should be made to drop the mill levy accordingly so that the taxpayer is getting benefited by the raise in the valuation. But they won't do it unless they're made to.
SG: Now is there anything else in terms of the assessor's role that we haven't covered?
KB: No, I don't think.
SG: Or anything else in terms of the city or county that you
want to add?
KB: Is there something you forgot to ask about? SG: No, I think we've covered it then.
KB: Yes. We went through pretty good.
SG: Okay, thank you very much.
