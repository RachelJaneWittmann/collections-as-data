CE: Thank you very much Mrs. Silver for taking this opportunity to talk with me. I really appreciate the opportunity. I'm especially interested in talking with you because you are also an historian and this is something I find very significant because there is no real history of Uravan except, I understand, from the very fine work that you've done. Before we begin talking about your experiences in this town, will you tell me where you were born and where you were raised and educated?
ES: All right. I was born in Olathe, Colorado. I was reared there and then finished high school in Olathe. Then I went two and a half years to Bible School, Midwest Bible School in Gordon, Nebraska. From there I went on to Anderson, Indiana, to the Anderson College and Theological Seminary. For a year and a
half I was majoring in Christian education. At that time my husband or my boyfriend came home from World War II and we became engaged and I quit college and was married. We lived around Olathe until we came to Uravan in 1952. During the time, when we came to
Uravan--we came here in the fall of '52. Then the

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
next fall my son was beginning school and there was no teacher for the first grade. So they approached me about teaching under the Emergency Certificate. I said I would and so I taught for two years, and during that time I started extension work through Western State College. I took in workshops and did extension work, also some correspondence work. Then
in later years I went on campus for two summers and I taught in Uravan and at Naturita six and a half years full-time. Then I worked as a teacher's aide and then I substituted for last years. My eyes got so bad I couldn't teach full-time. Then I just substituted.
CE: Do you want to talk about the community of Uravan during the '50s when you came and compare it between then and the '60s?
ES: The community, of course now has leveled off. We don't have the congestion that we have now, in accordance with the housing. The housing was the biggest problem. I know we couldn't find a house. We lived in a motel at Norwood. We paid seven dollars a day for a motel when we first came here. My husband
drove back and forth and then we lived on the---?--- in the big ranch house there. It's very fascinating-- the fireplace especially fascinated me because it had all different kinds of the rocks of the area in this
2

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
fireplace. We lived there a month and had paid our next month's rent when a flat top was available. Now the government owned the flat tops at that time and half of it was reserved for the United States Geological group. The rest of it was for the workers
in the mill. We got a flat top. So in order to have running water and a few of those conveniences we moved into the flat tops. There were 90 or 92 families in the flat tops at that time. So you see the housing was quite acute, and if anybody got a house they were the envy of the--everybody in the flat tops and people that were living in tents and living at Nucla and so far away--in order to have a place to live and have a family with them.
live in here was built. Half of this block was built when we came here and then the rest of the block was built a year or so later. Then they built H block and J block. We have rock names for those streets now,
but they had the same initial number, letter, and it eased the housing. Then the United States Geology Society moved out as a group and that helped. Then of course, later on--and now we've levelled off when people can find a house to live in now, a flat top or
The company wouldn't build any more houses?
CE:
ES: They did. They were in the process. Now this house we
3

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
something. So the town is just at an easy cue now and before it was just a mad rush to hope that their name would come up next to get a house.
What kind of services did you have at that time, so far as the stores were concerned?
It's the same, about the same as it was then. They enlarged the store but it's the same. I don't think they stock it as heavily now as they used to.
Was it adequate?
Yes, it was adequate. I feel that it was very fine. When we first came here you couldn't get your prescription filled so you had to go over that old road to Naturita or Nucla to get a prescription
filled which was very bad; so when they got the druggist it was really a wonderful asset to the community. I was trying to think, I can't recall right now. Maybe I can think when they had the first druggist in town.
You lease your house don't you? You don't rent it.
take out a certain portion each week of your check, which is automatically taken out. We'd pay $35 a month for this two-bedroom house, and this is the rent and the water. It was a gas furnace. We'd pay for the gas, the months, and of course they didn't
CE:
ES:
CE: ES:
CE:
ES: Oh we rent it. We rent it. When you're on hourly they
4

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
have telephones until just recent years in all of the houses. Some of the--they had the pay booths over at the drugstore and a few doctors and superintendent and a few of them had outside calls, but that was
all.
CE: So the general living conditions improved as the '50s ended and the '60s began?
ES: Yes, in certain things. We had a good doctor. We had good doctors here in town. But if you were going to be operated on you had to go out of town. Doctor Acres, when he came, he did try to start a hospital and he did run a hospital for a while over here and had twenty-four hour service, which was just wonderful, but when he left, Dr. Bermen came back and didn't want that, so it was easier to fly the patients out.
CE: You haven't found that an inconvenience in any way? ES: Oh yes, it's rather expensive to go out of town. I mean when you go to Junction it's ten dollars, you
might say. CE: Round trip?
ES: Yes. But you use and buy your meals and everything. You just expect that day is gong to cost you at least that much and so, I feel like though, our roads are-- see, when we first came here in '52 it was easier to
5

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
go through Norwood and Placerville and up thru Ridgeway and Montrose down through Junction than it was to go down through the canyon, and so of course we expected it to be, say, a four hour trip to get there, four hours to get there.
CE: So isolation was more of a problem in the '50s even then than it is now?
ES: Oh yes. We have this nice road and most people don't trade at Montrose and Duncan like they used to. They go to Junction now because we can get there in an hour and forty-five minutes and so that's much nicer.
CE: Something that I haven't asked anyone else today and something that I think should be covered, does the conversation in Uravan usually revolve around the company?
ES: We try, the women try not to do this because some of the men's salaries--some are hourly, and when we have meetings and things or social, we try not to do this. It revolved more around our children and things like this because there is a difference between your salaried and your hourly wage, and so our
conversation mostly is around our children.
CE: You don't think that there's any resentment so far as
the wives of the two groups are concerned?
ES: Not with most of them. But you take some people when
6

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
they are higher, on a higher level financially or something like that, they take advantage. That's natural, but to most of the ladies it doesn't make any difference when you're working in the PTA or in the church or anything--it just doesn't make any difference.
CE: Are women from both groups active in the Parent- Teacher Association?
ES: Oh yes. And the men too and the same in the church. There's just no difference between hourly and wage when it comes to the church and the work there and also in our social groups, I don't think.
CE: But the company projects then don't necessarily dominate the community?
ES: No, you know it used to be years ago, we kind of got weaned away from that, but when the PTA wanted anything or the church wanted anything, we'd go to the company and say, "Well, could we get this and could we get that," and they were very generous with everything. But they more or less cut back on this and it's good, it's very good. The people can work for what they get instead of having it handed to
them. So there are bake sales, for instance there's a
bake sale over in town today to raise funds for first aid classes and swimming, and for supplies they need,
7

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
and we take care of that more or less now.
CE: So in that respect it's been a good influence, the lack of company activity in the area.
ES: Taking care of all these little things. Major things that there [have been] a big need [for] the company takes care of.
CE: For instance?
ES: Well, for instance, the swimming pool. We had the old
swimming pool over here. It used to be a storage place and it wasn't good, right there at the mill site. So the company built us a big swimming pool and they take care of it, maintain it and all this. Same way with the ballpark. They pay the electric bill out there, when they have all the ball games and the VFW and another auxiliary runs a concession stand out at the ball park. We don't have to pay the electricity
for running the power and this and that, and so these
bigger things, they take care of it.
CE: Do you want to tell me what you've been doing as an
historian in regard to the things that you've been writing? I know that you've, for instance written a history of the school. Would you like to talk about that?
ES: Well, would you like to, the history of the school I wrote was a term paper, not a formal term paper.
8

 ESTALEE SILVER 11
Let's just say it was a paper that I did for a history class. I have given this at the West End Teacher's Association and I've given it in the schools to the children, and it's on file at the county superintendent's office because they didn't have a history of the school. It's also on file in our district superintendent's office here at Naturita.
CE: You said that you would give me a copy of that to put with the tape, would you then just give us a resume?
ES: Ah--
CE: The things you think should be brought out because
they are highlights.
ES: Yes. Well, our first school was in a tent. It was
during when Standard Chemical Company was here, Joe Junior Camp. The first teacher was Ellena Fightner and she had all the grades in this little tent. She had ten pupils. Mr. John Galley at Nucla who was one of the headmen at that Standard Chemical Company recalls that one morning he was walking down the road going to the mill and he met a little boy. The little boy said, "Well, how are you doing in school?" He said, "I'm just fine: I could count to twenty when I first started school and-I still can." So our school, it was limited. Having to have school in a tent it
9

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
was rather difficult, but they had school. The next school was the real building, rectangular building which is now being torn down. It was built in '36 and then they had the first school year in '37. According to the census now, there wasn't anything on that file that I could find. I had to go to the census books in Montrose. District 25 at that time was Naturita, Uravan and Long Park. Long Park is twelve miles from Uravan, but Long Park at one time had the base
station for Standard Chemical Company and had United States Radium Company there and the Radium Company of Colorado and different large companies at Long Park. Then they could just--it wasn't so hard to go up over the hill and into Naturita. The road here to Uravan was very bad. They would have to come before they got the little road from Naturita to Uravan, they would have to come to Nucla and come over the mesa there
and down into the Tapowatch and into Uravan. It was very bad so they had to go that way, but when you
look at the census so much of it was combined, and I have to go through and pick out and try to remember names and associate it with people I had heard talking about [that were] here. So they had their own school at Long Park and here and then at Naturita.
They had fifty-three children in the area between '06 10

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
and '21, and that is Uravan and Long Park. In '38 there were eighty-eight children in the area, and there were two rooms, so they had four grades in one room and four in the other and they had one row for each grade.
CE: A little different now, isn't it?
ES: Yes, it really is different, and so school progressed
and in 1944 there were a hundred and ninety in
school, but--and I think that the important part was so many of them when I interviewed them that had children here. In 1941 there were eight graduated from eighth grade down here, and this was the time that they were processing the uranium for the tailings ponds and this was like an army camp. Of course people that lived in C block on one side of town had to walk through the mill area or anyplace; they had to have their passes and guards at the gates and all was run just like an army camp except for the shows and the entertainment was for the soldier boys.
The people could get on it and benefit from--go to the shows and things, but it was for the benefit of the military. Then we saw a sharp decline in 1946 as the mill across the river was AEC and was controlled. They were closing down, but then in '46 they also closed, their beginning of closing down of the mill.
11

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
In '47 Morris Woods (who was Homer Woods) had the machinery shop across the river, and his son taught school and he had seven in his class taught there, just that many. That was all. The next year, during this time the school board members had shifted. Instead of having the members here all of the board members were at Naturita, and it has always been a difficult situation to get teachers in Uravan. One was inadequate housing. The company did not have housing for teachers so much at the time--they do now. There just weren't any houses. They didn't have any provided for the teachers at all and they didn't have any provided for the minister or anything like that. It was all mining and everything--well, milling mostly. Even the miners didn't live in Uravan except some of them that had a long-range lease in years past. So they, the school board was at Naturita and the people down here wanted teachers so badly. They didn't want their children to go over that terrible road to Naturita. It was all dusty. In the spring
they couldn't even go because they'd just bog down. The parents appealed to the board, and they said no. "If you want a teacher, we'll consent to a teacher but you must find him yourself." So Mr. and Mrs.
Morris Fox were largely responsible for getting the 12

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
teacher. They had heard about a little old English lady, Berthina Cook, who was looking for a teaching position. She was at Dolores. So they made this long hard trip to Dolores, Colorado, just there to find out that she had left from Montrose to board the bus there to leave. So they turned around and came from
Dolores to Montrose and got there just as she was getting on the bus and they got her. She stayed in the homes and the mothers carried, did the carrying of the water for the school in the tow, and they were so glad to have this little lady to be a teacher and have school here. Then in '49 they split it up again, the first four grades were in Uravan and the other four were at Naturita. They had to have, they had a pickup and Sheldon Latham who is deceased--the VFW posted his name after he was killed in the war--drove the pickup with the canvas over the back and took those children to Naturita and then went on to the high school out at Nucla. As the area began to open up, in '51 and '52 they built on another room, there
were two rooms added, making the school building into an "L" shape. In '53 and '54 the school had increased over two hundred percent from six years before. You can just imagine, there were 225 pupils into school
and while they were there, that's the year I taught, 13

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
there was no room in the school. There were four rooms and they couldn't hold 225 people, so they put- -there were fifty children in the first grade, so we went to the rec hall and I had twenty-nine pupils in a room fourteen feet square and I had a 3 x 3 foot blackboard. The books were very inadequate. In fact,
I had one complete set of reading books for the children and we had school there in the recreation hall in one room, but it was an open room and [would] get to the main auditorium. The children, we had school when they weren't having anything else in the auditorium, in the rec. hall. If they weren't having a Union Carbide meeting or a banquet and--I know one thing that was so terrible and I'll always remember that, they decided to redo the gym or the rec. hall floors, the main auditorium. The stuff they used on the floors was so bad that it made all the children sick and made me sick and children would run back to the fountain every few minutes to get a drink. But it had to be, and then the boys would practice
basketball and come in at two, two-thirty, and of course I imagined how could they study during the pump, pump, pump? So the other first grade teacher and I would have music or something. That's all we could do. Then they had a class downstairs for the
14

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
sixth grade in the basement of the rec. hall, until they got a new building fixed so that we could move up in May. Just before school was out we could move up to school, to the metal building. Then the next year when I taught the second grade I was in the basement of the rec. hall until they could finish another room because they had increased so much. So we really had lots of fun in the school system, and Long Park couldn't get teachers. They were in the same district. The teacher they had would sleep until noon, and it had been going on for several years so they decided to bring those children down from Long
Park. They had this bus over this--in fact, the Denver Post reporter came and rode the bus with the principal of the school who was a teacher, and he wrote in the Denver Post that that was the most treacherous road he had ever been on. We hear so much about Beaver Mesa now and the bad road, and they were trying to close the school down up there because
there were so many children, but it was a terrible thing. In the morning when it snowed or we knew the roads were bad, if that bus was late for school we'd all--all the teachers would walk the floor because we realized that anything could have happened on that
road. One morning they were late and the bus had 15

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
slipped off the road and a tree had caught that bus. That was the only thing that saved all those children.
CE: Who was responsible for fixing those roads?
ES: I believe it was--now the AEC developed a lot of
these roads, you know, they developed a road over at Paradox and oiled it to Paradox and up over the La Sals to Utah, and I believe that perhaps it was--it could have been county too. It was just a hard thing to do. Now they finally oiled up the hill, used to go up to the mill there and on up and go over. They finally made a new road up this one place that was so bad. They bussed those children down and those children would be sick when they'd get to school, but anyway, I remember Helen Tucker had the third grade, she went in about half the year and she had children in that room that were thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen y~~rs old from Long Park, because the teachers--nobody checked on them. There was nobody to do much there and they wouldn't come to classes. The children didn't get taught. Big sisters would teach
the little children, their big brothers would teach the little ones. But there we had this third grade all these big children had come down from Long Park. They didn't have school.
16

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
CE: How would they be in third grade though?
ES: Well, they couldn't do any better. They weren't on
any higher level of learning and so they had to put
them there.
CE: It's hard to believe that this would exist in the
¥sos.
ES: Yes, but it was there. So then the PTA was quite
active. I don't have it here in the paper but the PTA--they were called PTC at that time--they felt like there was no point in belonging to the national PTA because we couldn't get help or speakers or anything to come into here to do things. People here are--so many are well qualified in leadership--you get these young couples who are just out of college
in the mining departments and the mill and all and you get people who are outstanding in leadership, and we had a wonderful PTC. We didn't want to be in the national and pay the dues. Later on when the roads got better and we could avail ourselves to different things we could rejoin PTA, but the PTC started the hot lunch program and they did it, some of the ladies did it. People donated and this and that and the children went back to the school to the rec. hall.
Union Carbide bought a big stove to put in the kitchen so they could cook on it. The parents went in
17

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
there and the PTC sponsored it and people came from all over to help with those hot lunches. So we started in Long Park. At that time there was Golden Cycle too, this other area where they had to come thirteen miles and seven miles down the mountainside, but they started the hot lunch program.
CE: Who did you say lived in the Long Park area?
ES: Miners, mostly miners, people who worked in the
mines.
CE: Were they a transient type people, is that the reason
why their thirteen year old children would be in the
third grade?
ES: No, they'd just been up there all those years, you
know, during the--there was some mining going on all the time, more or less, and families who had lived
out in the area most of the time. A lot of those families are still in the areas and so, of course there weren't a lot of those children like that.
There were about eight or ten of them that were in such a circumstance as far as their learning was concerned. So our school has improved. Our biggest trouble in the school was that, you know, you're budgeted in the school system so much, and the budget couldn't increase as fast as the pupils increased. So
therefore, they couldn't get the things that they 18

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
needed to get. They got books as fast as they could and things, but as far as other equipment, it was a slow process. PTC bought playground equipment for the little children and then later on the school could pay. They bought the stuff for Naturita there and here, the library books. The PTC bought these. We had
CE:
fund raising. You could hardly get radio here and there was no TV so we had our own entertainment. We had a show maybe twice a week or so over there and then we had bazaars and carnivals and minstrel shows with really active and really talented people. I feel like our community, perhaps, maybe it's lacking in high culture and we don't have the civic centers for them to go, to but I feel like the children taking part in the community has helped our children. I feel like we've sent out real fine young people from here. How much influence does the company have over the school?
ES: None, I would say. That's been our experience all these years.
CE: --that you've been involved actively in the school. ES: Yes. I feel like that, of course it's our company men
who run the school board and there's one representative now since they consolidated. I don't feel like there's something gone wrong. I don't feel
19

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
like, I don't think Union Carbide as Union Carbide has interfered in any way. The citizens have, and that's their privilege to go before the school board if they don't like something and the people, but to go and say in the name of say, Union Carbide, "You shouldn't do this or that or our taxes will be withheld," it just isn't that way.
Because Union Carbide does contribute probably more than anybody in the country.
ES: Oh yes. It's quite a bit you know, when they consolidated over here and Montrose East and Montrose didn't have control over the high school. See that
was our big problem, was our high school. Then they were hurting over at Montrose in that area and our high school over here got a boost because the board members were in charge of grade schools and the
junior high and the high school. For instance, one time when the Vansats were here. He was superintendent of the mill here and Mrs. Vansat was very, very active in girl scouts and cub scouts and
in the situation in the high school and all, and they told us (the east end) if we'd campaign to get a bond issue passed they'd get us a new bus. See, the bus for the high school was just put together with
chewing gum and shoestrings and breaking down and the 20
CE:

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
kids weren't getting to school. The people here had to raise funds to pay the bus driver even. I had something to do with that part, the bus or they
CE:
[wouldn't have done] it. So the people just really went together and made it rough enough so that they felt like they needed to get a new bus for the high
school kids and pay the bus driver.
Do you think that over the years the schools have been the center of the community life?
ES: Well, a lot of it revolved around it, but we have other organizations. The church is a strong influence and our scout program is as effective. So we have a different process of, facets of influences in our town.
CE: Do you have any idea what percent of the students who graduate from Nucla High School, those who are from Uravan, go onto either trade school or college?
ES: No, I don't. It varies, it varies from year to year. We have, I remember the year that my younger son graduated from high school, of the twelve or thirteen there was a higher percent of the class, all of them were from Uravan except two, I believe, that year, but it varies, and most of those have tried college or gone on. But one year a lot of them will go right into the service, the boys. The next year a lot of
21

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
them will go to college, and so I don't know what percentage. We have a strong percentage of leadership from Uravan in our high school and in our junior high. Quite a few of them are honor roll students and in leadership. Now we have one of the girls, student body president next year from Uravan and the high school, and Uravan takes a strong leadership responsibility in the school.
CE: Did you encounter any problems with prejudice while you were working in the schools or did you know of any--recognize any for instance against the Navajos of which there were quite a few now?
ES: No, no. Not in Uravan. I don't see any, I can't see it in the schools. They just had the children all play together. There's no groping unless the children themselves choose to play, some of the little Navajo children that can't speak English very well--they would choose, but most of them just--there's no difference.
CE: There is no language problem then?
ES: Oh yes. There were some of them, not in the recent
years so much, but we used to have quite a problem. In fact they, then, this new program with classes at night. It's you know, it's Title--what is it? It isn't Title Three. It's something that's government-
22

 ESTALEE SILVER #1 sponsored.
CE: Don't they---?---
ES: Uh huh, yes. Yes, they have Navajo education and they
have Frank Smith, an English man teaching the
Navajos, to those who wanted to take it and so-- CE: It's a very sensitive mike and it picks up
everything. That's all right. I just wanted to be sure your voice comes through as I wind this back. Do you think the teachers' salaries compare with those
in the community around this area?
ES: I don't know. You know they've been getting raises and you'd have to talk to somebody that's teaching now to know, who knows.
CE: You don't hear any complaints from--that it's too low?
ES: They always try to get better naturally. The West End Teacher's Association is always striving to get better pay.
CE: I talked with Mr. Pinnock as I told you, and he said they have an organization, a cooperative through which they recruit their teachers. That has not always been true though, has it?
ES: W ell--
CE: In other words--
ES: They have gone to the Placement Center to try to get
23

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
teachers and we've gotten teachers, but you see--! know one year we needed a couple to teach so badly, two teachers in this school and they signed the contract and didn't come. They got into Uravan and
CE:
looked at the mill and said, "Why didn't you tell us there's a mill here? We have asthma." Away they went the day before school. So it is a problem. It's a problem to get the young teachers here because they're away from the activity. It's hard for
singles. For married couples with families this is an ideal place, but for single kids it isn't.
I talked with Mrs. Larrison about the religious activities and she gave me a very thorough and good background, but I wondered if you wanted to contribute anything to that since I know you've been active in this area too? Unless there's something else about the school--
No, the school is all right since you'll have a copy of it. Now she gave you when it was first organized, did she, in 1955?
I'm not sure she gave me that date. I would assume she did though. And the manner in which it was done.
ES:
CE:
ES: Yes, and--
CE: Had you written anything about this?
ES: Just a brief history so that I could fill in on it
24

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
later on. Just briefly, because I wasn't--when I started in I wanted to go way back, I wanted to go back to the Indians and the Radium and the flume story and all this. So I just wrote down brief things like this so that I can go back later on when I've got my history up to that point. I don't know what she said so I don't know what to add. Our big problem
in our church is our people moving of course. We get somebody that's very active in the church and then
all of a sudden they're transferred and it makes it hard. Whereas in another community where everybody stays put--I was asking Mrs. McKay who is the secretary-treasurer, I said--we talked something about the church and I said, "Since we organized in 1955, the church, what has been our membership in our church?" She told me and she said that there were 169 people who have been members in the church and I ran to that. During this length of time perhaps our total membership would run forty-five or something like that because the people are moved and it takes a while for somebody new to come in and understand the community church, especially when they're been used to working in a certain denomination and all. They say, "Well, we won't be here very long," and some of them come in with the idea that they'll be permanent,

and that's the way to do it when you come to Uravan instead of saying, "Well I'm just--We know that we can't retire in Uravan; when we get to be sixty-five we have to leave," so that's--I think this is the problem in our whole community that people think, "Well, I'm just here. I can't own my home and when I retire I have to leave," so it's bad there. That's the situation.
Don't you think despite that there is a community spirit?
ES: Oh yes, that's the thing that makes Uravan is the community, the way the people work together and if there's any need. For instance, a family was in a car wreck. People brought in groceries and took care of the children. I remember we had a grocery shower and that poor woman, you know, in these small houses, she
had one room just stacked with groceries that people had brought her. But that's it. You know your neighbor and if your neighbor's sick you know you can go in and help them, and you don't have grudges in this town. I think that's the beautiful thing of our community church. You don't have those old, old grudges and those old, old wedges that you have
because, well, they're sixty-five and they're gone, you know. You don't find this friction and this

hatred and things in the community that you have other places.

Is there anything else about which you've written that you'd like to tell?
Not unless there's something that you just especially want.
Didn't you say you did a history on a post office?
I jotted down things on the post office but he probably gave you this.
Not really, not really.
Let's see, did I have it with this group? In looking back and researching and trying to find out who, how the first mail was brought to Uravan we found that it was brought to Uravan or to the flume area in 1892 according to the Bible date--this is the family
Bible. Mr. Souther was the mail carrier and he had a little mule in order to get around the cliffs. Then at times he'd have to get off and walk and lead his mule because the cliffs [were] hanging over and he couldn't ride, so he'd have to walk his mule. So I think that perhaps that was the first time. We have a hard time finding, I know I had an awful time trying to find the town of Uranium, and I knew there was mail that was carried to Uranium and Hydraulic and I just, I couldn't find [anything]. I finally found in
27

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
the abstract office over in Montrose the town of Hydraulic on the map over there. It was down on Mesa Creek, where the creek forks according to the map. I couldn't find Uranium, and one night I gave a lecture or a story, it was a flume story at the PTA at Naturita. Mrs. Joslin was there and she said, "Well,
I know where your town Uranium is." And she said, "My husband's grandparents had the town Uranium and it was for the Roger Mine," where the first uranium was taken from, the uranium from the Roger Mine was where they first identified that it was carnotite ore and
it had your three elements in it; uranium, vanadium and radium, and it was a ranch house. There were enough miners and enough people in that area that they could declare it a town, and they had the post office in the ranch house.
CE: Now where is this specifically?
ES:
You go to Rock Creek and you see the sign Rock Creek going toward Gateway. It's back in a little basin back there. The ranch is there. Its original farmhouse has burned down and they have another house there. So I knew they had carried mail there, but I couldn't figure out where it was. Nobody knew where
Uranium was. There are still rope ladders, there were two rope ladders hanging from the cliffs, but one

has--somebody has tried to climb it and it just recently has fallen. But they thought both of those
rope ladders were for the people, the miners came down to meet the mail carrier, men on horseback, to get their mail. The other ladder was not really for carrying mail, and that ladder still is up there and
it was a hermit by the name of John Christian--have you heard about that? That's our only grave in our area is John Christian's grave down by the San Miguel River.
CE: There's no cemetery around here?
ES: There's no cemetery.
CE: You don't die at Uravan?
ES: You die at Uravan, but you either go to Nucla--
there's a cemetery at Nucla--and Norwood or Grand Junction or where. So many of the people here are from closer areas like Olathe and Delta and this and that, but there isn't any cemetery in Uravan or in the area. So John Christian's grave is marked just John Christian--no date on it or anything, but Mrs. John Calahoun that used to live on the Clark Ranch--
CE: Mrs. John who?
ES: Calahoun, there's Frank Calahoun and there's quite a
few of the boys around the area. There's one that's a judge, Frank. Is it Frank that's the judge at Delta?

Anyway, she wrote to me and told me about John Christian and Wilson Rockwell, an historian that has done some research on John Christian. He was a hermit. He was supposed to be of a noble class from
Denmark and he came here to escape being in the military.
Now our boys go to Denmark to escape.
CE:
ES: Yes, I see that's a change in your generation. But he
came here and he was quite an inventor. I have a little socket he made. It's quite an interesting place to go down over the hill and you know where the sign is, the marker is about the flume--by the way that's all wrong. It's wrong. I told the lady from the State Historical Society, I said, "They've done this wrongá." I said they completed that flume and they had water running through it, it ran all summer long and fall, and I said they completed that flume
and they worked it. They got the gold out and everything. I said, "This is all wrong." She said, "Well, write and tell us."
CE: Did you?
ES: No, I haven't. I thought I'd wait till--she wanted me
to write the paper on the flume, and I thought I'd got that Kritten. You know how it was, when you have- -you think you have enough information and then you
30

 ESTALEE SILVER #1
get a lead you want to go find out about it and you think--well, there's one picture I want of the flume so badly and I can't find it. I know it exists because Wilson Rockwell had borrowed it from a Page
CE:
ES:
Boy in Denver and he wouldn't tell me who the Page Boy was or anything so I could get hold of it. It shows the water running through the flume.
How sad. Isn't it sad that we can't share the knowledge that we have so that other people can benefit from it?
He just--I've tried to find that picture. But anyway, John Christian was quite an inventor and his grave's down there and this ladder, he built this ladder to go up on the ledge to hunt rabbits. If you can
imagine.
Ingenuity.
Of course when he first bought this, this was the ladder for the mail too. The first post office was the in the Uravan Boarding House which still stands, in 1936.
I've had two great meals there.
Jennie Morris was the postmistress from 1939 to 1946. Then Mabel Latham was 1946 to June 1953 and then Elton Benedict. So this moved across the road to the present building in 1939. That used to be the old

club house for the Standard Chemical Company.
CE: Thank you. That was interesting. Especially the first part. Is there anything further, Mrs. Silver, that you would like to contribute before we conclude?
ES: I can't think of anything. I think this article from the Nucla Forum of the prospectors' rush to stake new claims that was opened up, it would be I guess it was in 1954, it is a very good one and maybe you could-- it was written by the publisher of the Nucla Forum.
CE: I'll get that information after we have concluded. Maybe I can write to him and secure a copy.
ES: I'm sure they have it at Nucla, the Nucla Forum. That's where I went back in the files and found it. There's someway you could get a photostat copy of this would be all right, but I remember when they had it and all the excitement. I can remember two of our young boys or our men that worked in the mill staked the claim. They really had a rich claim and came to find out later that Union Carbide had made a mistake.
They had already staked it and it wasn't really to be staked. They weren't supposed to, and then another time--Bob Briddle will tell you about his brother-in- law. He thought he really had a rich claim over there in Paradox and he was just so excited and came to find out it was the old mill site that had collapsed
32

 ESTALEE SILVER ~1
and Coolidge had their mill for Madame Curie. So there were really some wild talks, but this one is the best one I think, article that he wrote. He was on the spot when they started staking the claims that morning.
CE: Well, I certainly do thank you. This has been a very nice hour and I appreciate the cooperation that you have given me.
ES: Well, I hope I've helped you some. I don't know. ES: You have. Thank you very much.
