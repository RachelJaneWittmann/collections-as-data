 [ T H I S I S AN INTER VIEW WITH HAL SCHUL TZ. THE DA TE I S OCTOBER 13, 1993. THE INTERVIEWER IS MADGE TOMSIC.]
MT: Let's go back to maybe your parents. Did your parents come over to this country or were they born here?
HS: Dad was born in Philadelphia, in the Pennsylvania Dutch community of Philadelphia. It was really German but they called it Dutch. He moved to Castle Gate when he was four, that would be in 1892. Mother was born in Lake Champlain, up on the New York-New Hampshire border. She came West as an 18 year old normal school graduate, that was the equivalent of a two-year college. She got her teaching certificate. She came out to the Wild West to adventure, and she sure had a lot of them. She wrote a nice little book about her adventures of her life.
MT: We have that book at the museum.
HS: Do you? Not too polished, but it's interesting.
MT: Very!
HS: Well, then they took various trails. Dad lived in Salt
Lake, he had moved from Castle Gate to Salt Lake somewhere along the line. He was going to West High when it was part of the University. They kind of jumbled things up and he didn't like it. So he quit school and went to work for Kennecott.
MT: When he was in high school he quit?
HS: Yes, in lOth grade.
MT: Really! Let's go back just a second. Why did they come to
Castle Gate?

 HAL SCHULTZ
HS: My grandfather, after whom I am named, and my real name
is Harry James, was a clerk. They were recruiting clerks back East and he got a job with Castle Gate. I guess it was Castle Gate Coal Co. originally then before it was independent. He came out to Castle Gate and he was in on the big payroll robbery up there, you have read about that.
MT: Absolutely! I know about Butch Cassidy.
HS: He was up on the second floor of the big old stone office
building and Grandpa pulled an old rusty rifle off the wall and aimed it out of the window hoping it would shoot. It didn't and so somebody shot at him and left their mark on the window sill just below his belly button. He had a pretty close one.
MT: He was up there when they came after the money?
HS: Yeah. When they were leaving with the money and they spotted him up there trying to take a shot at them with this old rifle so they took a shot back and I guess he hit the floor after that. If he was smart he did. Then they moved to Salt Lake where they got promoted I guess to the City Office. My grandmother had been married once before and her husband was a jeweler. He died after they
MT :
had been married a short time and left her $20,000.00, big money.
Big honey in those days!
2

 HAL SCHULTZ
HS: Yes, in 1890 something. She had high society aspiration,
so she bought a house. I think she kind of led my grandfather around. She bought a house on South Temple Street and they paraded every Sunday with a gold headed cane for Grandpa and a fancy new hat for Grandma. She was a hard little Scotch woman, she was tough. Just as an example, when I took Leila up to meet her after we were married she looked her over and she looked at me and she said: "She has pretty eyes, not little pig eyes like you!" She could be kind of mean. But anyway, Dad quit school. His Uncle Frank... was a mining magnet in New Mexico and had some dabbling in Utah's Metal Mines. He gotdadtogodowntheretogotowork, sohedidandhe taught himself engineering by international correspondence schools and became a very competent engineer. My mother went down there to Dawson, New Mexico, to teach school and eventually they got together and went up to Glenwood Springs and got married.
MT: That's were they met, in Dawson, New Mexico?
HS: New Mexico. So then, Frank... was big in the US Fuel Co.
So he promoted dad up here to run the Hiawatha Mines, and he was Superintendent in Hiawatha. And then Frank Cameron and Ross Weber, _and Frank Latuda Sr. got this property up here and decided to open the Liberty Mine. Well, which they did and, I forget when, it was about 1915 or 16 it
3

 HAL SCHULTZ
was in trouble, they had a terrible haulage on the outside of the mountain there. It was so steep that a big snowball would derail a trip. So anyway, they called on dad again and asked him to give up the Hiawatha job and come over there and straighten the mine out. So he did. He never resisted a challenge.
MT: Did your dad spend much time as a coal miner? Did he work in the mines himself or?
HS: He started out as a surveyor's helper, he didn't shovel coal.
MT: As a surveyor?
HS: As a surveyor's helper, that's how he started out. It was
all hand mining in those days anyway, he learned the fine art of hand drilling and even tamping with black powder in some of those places. He got pretty broadly experienced all the way but you never actually call him a coal miner, I guess.
MT: I was just sort of wondering if he started at the top, but he didn't.
HS: No, he worked as a surveyor's helper down there for a number of years. And during that period is when he took his correspondence course and.wound up as Chief Engineer down there at Dawson Mines, and they got him up to Hiawatha . That was a promotion for his good work . But then when they had him at the Liberty Mine, that was a
4

 HAL SCHULTZ
heck of a headache. They opened this mine where the haulage was terrible; they were loosing money as fast as they could find it. So he went over there. Just about killed himself off during World War I. He was exempted from being drafted because they needed coal worse then anything. So he started the route tunnel, the rock slope, it became their permanent haulage and straightened out some other things. Started up the gradual process of mechanization. I don't mean any fancy mechanization. For then just going to a Jeffrey post drill was an advance in mechanization. He about wore himself out. My brother and sister were born in Hiawatha, they came with the deal. And I was born in Latuda. The first white house above the second bridge in .Latuda. I was born there at eight o'clock one night in 1919. Turns out it was the 16th anniversary of the Wright Brothers first flight. Auspicious day.
MT: What was the date again?
HS: December 17th, 1919, that was my birthday. He did well
for the company. So they sent him to Alaska for a month of R&R one summer when things slowed down a little. During the war they worked 3&5 days, Christmas and all, because they had to have the coal. Later when the war was over it slowed down a little bit so they sent him on an Alaskan cruise to recover his strength. He came back and
5

 HAL SCHULTZ
continued to mechanize the mine and he did so well he made a lot of people rich other then himself, of course. But they treated him right to the point they, when the Depression came along, and they were losing money and not making any, the mines working only 3 or 4 months out of the year. They kept his salary right up there and gave him a Christmas bonus, too.
MT: I just wanted to ask you, you were átalking about mechanization. What kind of things were they mechanizing in the early '20s? What kinds of things were they
bringing into the mine?
HS: He brought in the Sullivan hydraulic shovel. That was a
machine mounted on tracks, but it was run hydraulically. They'd shoot down the face of the coal, and would run this machine up as close as they could with the shovel back and then they put this big jack up against the roof to anchor the machine so it couldn't move. Then this scoop, which was also hydraulic, would scoop up a ton of coal and swing around and dump it in the mine car. It had a big bucket, it was like a big sugar scoop, it had a thing in there to push the coal out, when they wanted it, all hydraulic. And that was a mining son of a gun, it really produced. But they were still dumping it into those old wooden pit cars and so they had to lay track every time they made a new cut they put down short rails
6

 HAL SCHULTZ
to move the cars up and take them away with horses and mules to the main haulage.
Were men replaced? Did they have to lay off men when they got this?
I don't know if they did or not. I don't think they did because they were still expanding the markets. They had a premium grade of coal and it was high coal and easy
mining. I doubt they laid anybody off but I really don't remember. It was a pretty bustling town all along. But of course, during the tail end of the '20s and the beginning of, well all of the '30s, up until the World War II started, the miners worked very sporadically. They'd start, the dealers started storing coal, it was all domestic heating coal then, they weren't generating any power with it. So they'd start the storage season. They'd start shipping to the Northwest in the middle of August and they'd work up to a five day week, then they'd get up to 6 days, and then they'd get up to 7 days. I think they'd quit working Thanksgiving or Christmas, somewhere along the line there in the early '30s. But they worked like crazy and then if we had a warm and early thaw they would just shut the place down, that's all they could do. No other markets . Sometime the mines wouldn't work a day in May, June and July. From the end of April until the middle of August they might be down for 4 months. So it
MT:
HS:

 HAL SCHULTZ
was very difficult, although they had a lot of contract mines. So the men, generally speaking, made good money.
I remember Chris DiCola, he was a machine operator on contract, I remember him coming in and offering Dad a trade for his paychecks, and Dad says you wouldn't if you saw yours and mine together. Because he made twice as much as the boss did. But anyway, a lot of them ran out of money. Obviously there were low paying jobs as well as good paying jobs. And so they would run out of money. Dad would never have anything to do with the company store. He thought that was an evil.
MT: Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.
HS: Mr. Marchetti, somehow he got a piece of ground up there.
I guess people were speculating in coal in those days. He got a piece of ground and he was up there next to where they eventually had their loading tracks from the tipple, I believe that was his piece of land. So he cut a deal, they gave him the land and they built him a store and a house. No connection to the company at all, just gave him a deed to it.
MT: Really! Mr. Marchetti?
HS: Yeah, of course, eventually their distant relative, Val
Turri, came to this country and worked in their butcher shop. I remember Val when he just knew "yes" and "no" and that was all.
8

 HAL SCHULTZ
MT: He had just came over from Italy, right?
HS: Well yeah, the northern slopes of Italy, where Italy and
Austria come together, Tyrol. They were up awfully close to the Swiss yodelers. But they were Italian by citizenship and whatever.
MT: But they spoke Italian?
HS: Yes. So, Val worked in the butcher shop there and I kind
of lost track of the years after that, but of course eventually he leased the downstairs from Marchetti and then opened a pool hall where a fascinating sluff game was played often until the wee hours of the morning until 5 or 6 in the morning, they "sluffed for solo", as they called it.
MT: Is that a card game?
HS: Yes, it's a card game where 4 or 5 people can play. They
never gambled for money but they gambled for goods. Dad would come home with a bottle of whiskey, even though it was prohibition. I don't know, maybe they let him win because he was the boss. But I think he was just a good sluff player. He was a good-hearted guy, stern and I might say demanding to a point where he liked performance in his kids as well as his workers. He developed some prejudices in terms of the workers. I'm not going to get
into them but speaking of prejudices that was in those days, it was part of this countries whatever that black
9

 HAL SCHULTZ
people were down at the bottom of the heap. We had one black family. They weren't very black but their name was Brown and they were brown. Well, anyway, they were allowed to live in an old stable and he dug the holes for the privies. That's the only job a black person could get around coal mines.
MT: So they didn't work in the mine?
HS: Not then.
MT: Now, that was when, the '20s?
HS The '20s. Allison Brown turned out to be very
successful surgeon in St. Louis.
MT: That was one of his sons?
HS: Hm. The only son.
MT: His dad dug toilet holes?
HS: When anybody's pit got too full they'd call on Mr. Brown
to dig them a new one and Mr. Gamby, the barn boss, would come down with a team and drag the privy over the new hole and set it. It was just a continuing operation. There were only 3 bathrooms in the town at that time. We had one, the chief clerk Mr. Davies had one and I see a little bias coming up there, my uncle had one. I'll never forget Allison's first day in school when they moved there. The teacher was a most insensitive type of woman. She made him stand up, I can't even say it, stand up and bow his head, so we could all feel his fuzzy hair. Can
10

 HAL SCHULTZ
you imagine doing that to a kid?
MT: That's terrible!
HS: Yeah, it is, it's criminal.
MT: Oh, my goodness!
HS: That was life in the USA in those days, I guess, I don't
know. But it's remarkable how Allison turned out so well. MT: Now, he became a surgeon, right?
HS: I followed him somehow for a number of years, I forget
when I lost track of him. Of course we had a sizeable Japanese contingent. And they moved in what was the same vein of United States society called a "Jap" camp. Nobody said Japanese. Mr Imamoto ran the camp, he was the boss, ran the camp for the bachelors, he was the only one in the family.
MT: And they had a boarding house for them?
HS: Yeah, it was right up there by the mine, right north of
the bath house. But they kept to themselves, they were well mannered people and they had their own place to live. They worked in their own section of the mine and they could speak Japanese there because Mr. Imamoto was their supervisor, foreman. And he had 3 kids, Taski, who
took on the name of Ray, and Fumio, who became Alice, and Karatio. She came later. She went to high school in Japan and lived with her grandparents. She took on the name of June when she came here. She became, you knew her, my
11

 HAL SCHULTZ
memory is getting terrible, the cleaning people downtown.
MT: Oh, is that right?
HS: That was June. Her name was ... , but, why can't I say his
name. There is something about old age that interferes
with my thinking.
MT: I'm trying to think who we are talking about here.
HS: Well, at any rate, there were a lot of Italians,
Yugoslavs, Austrians. I don't recall any Greek families in Latuda. Living there, growing up there was great. We could go out from our house. When I was four they built us a house up on the hill. We could go out in the back yard and see rabbits, and foxes and owls, all kinds of things. We used to capture baby rabbits and take them home for pets. It was shoes off and for most kids it was bald heads all summer long. They couldn't afford hair cuts and they knew they would get into ticks and things, so they just shaved everybody's head as soon as school was out. I didn't get shaved but I really was closed cropped. Bare feet and bare head in the summertime. But I remember the hard times. The men would come up and take their hats off. I still get so emotional, but these things just kind of get to me. They ask to borrow twenty bucks in August to buy some shoes for their kids because t hey hadn't worked since A pril or May. They were hard times.
12

 HAL SCHULTZ
MT: They borrowed money from the company?
HS: From my Dad, the company didn't have a loan program. Mr.
Marchetti was very good about the bills, he never foreclosed on anybody's credit unless they were really rotten. He carried them all summer. They'd wind up with zero money, no money to start the kids off to school. So Dad always had a stack of twenties. It was embarrassing for me because these were my friends.
MT: So how did that make you feel relating to all these kids in school?
HS: We all got along. I detested the prejudice. I remember the chief clerk's boy Grant called Taski Imamoto a "slant eyed chink". That's when I jumped on him. Of course I got in trouble with the principal for fighting in school. I don't know who really taught me that kind of a feeling, I guess it was my mother. But I just couldn't stand it, it hurt me.
MT: That's interesting that at that young age you understood and had those feelings about people.
HS: We had some wonderful times and the family would pack up along with my uncle... who didn't have any kids, and the Ledgers. Ledger was the tipple foreman at one time, and he lost his arm on a conveyor belt on the tipple there. His right arm ripped right off, but he learned to face with his left arm. Three families would pack up and go to
13

 HAL SCHULTZ
the Uintah's. First we used to go to Lake Fork and then we started going to the Uintah's and camp for ten days every summer. And then we would have little short trips inbetween. That was a big adventure to go 1,000 miles from home. Of course Dad had to go to Salt Lake every once in a while too, and that was an adventure, because they were always working on that road, either in Price Canyon or Spanish Fork Canyon. I remember some hazardous trips in muddy weather, where we slid and slid.
MT: So in the '20s that road wasn't surfaced?
HS: No, I forget when they did surface it, at least big parts of it weren't. I guess a good share of it was, I'd say about 50% was surfaced, I could be off on that. I remember my feisty little auntie, we were going on a detour, it was raining like heck, sliding around and here came the meat wagon. The little man used to drive out
from Spanish Fork with fresh meat every 2 or 3 days. And he would not go on his side of the road because that was where it dropped off 100 feet or so. He refused to go. So Dad says get over there as close as you can, and he went on the outside. I'll never forget my little Auntie Agnes saying: "I think you boys ought to get out and beat him up!" We had a lot of trips like that. Going to Salt Lake was a big deal. We'd always pack a lunch and stop at the Castella Hot Springs or something like that and have our
14

 HAL SCHULTZ
picnic lunch. It was a days trip.
MT: HS:
How long did it take to drive over there?
I don't remember, I know it was kind of an all day process to pack and get in there and stop for lunch on the way. Going over Indian Canyon is an experience in itself too, you know. In those days it really was a chore.
Exactly!
I'm trying to remember who the first Latuda man was to get over Indian Canyon in high gear. That was a goal to Latuda people that had cars for years to be the first to get over Indian Canyon in high gear.
Were there many automobiles up there?
Oh yeah, all of the well paid people had automobiles. Chris DiCola always had to have one a little better than the bosses. And I think he finally made it over Indian Canyon in high gear.
Now what did Chris do?
He was a mining machine operator...
So he probably made pretty good money.
Yeah, he did. And he and Slim Williams competed. They actually competed for the job of superintendent, for mine foreman, I gues_s. And when Slim got it Chris stomped out of town, just packed up and left he was so angry. He was a hot tempered Austrian. Dad had to make a choice. We
MT: HS:
MT: HS:
MT: HS: MT: HS:
15

 HAL SCHULTZ
were talking about this a little while ago about how tough it is. He had two very fine people. He had to make the choice and he made it.
Let's talk about your dad a little more. I know your dad bought an airplane. Tell us about this.
I'll have to back up a little bit. I was reminiscing the other day. There was an article in the Tribune. In the
'20s every kid in town worshiped Tony Lazari, a Helper boy who made it in the big leagues. You have heard of him, I'm sure. Mr.... He had at one time more home runs than Babe Ruth did, I believe. But the Babe finally out did him. But we worshiped that guy. He was our hero and then something happened. Lindberg flew the ocean and that was it.
MT: That was in 1927.
HS: In 1927. We worshiped Lindberg from then on. I remember
Dick and I were up on the top of that mountain to the southwest, the grassy slope. We had gone up there to make a fire and roasted some wieners and an airplane came over and cleared the ridge by about 50 feet. I suspect, I don't remember too well, I suspect it was . . . from World War I, up there trying to scout some customers out of the hills and come down to Price and take an airplane ride. It was so close that we could read all the numbers if we could read, but I think I was only about seven. No, I
MT:
HS:
16

 HAL SCHULTZ
would have been older than that. I was about 10 I guess. Anyway, then Dad kind of caught the fever. And as I said, they treated him, the company treated him so well because he saved them that he was, well you could say he was wealthy because he made 500 bucks a month, there was no income tax. Groceries for the family were 30 bucks a month, rent was 30 and that was all. The rest of it was free money. So, $6,000 a year was big money, plus a $250 Christmas bonus. So, he had saved. So he decided he wanted to learn how to fly. So he packed up the family and one of his friends went with us and we went to Long Beach, Ca. I'm not sure why, but that's where we went. And he spent a few days there at the airport casing. There were about four or five fixed base operators. FBO's they called them. And he cased them until he decided to what was the type of person he wanted. Well, anyway, he started flying lessons at hanger #1, George Leonard at Long Beach. There is another story about that. But, we had an apartment in town we rented and we spent our time in the ocean or down on the pike, which was about a five mile long carnival and various things. Dad flew and he took it easy and he did his ground school. In those days flying lessons were 20 minutes, not and hour or two.
MT: What year would that be, Hal?
HS: This would be '32. He soloed the day we had to leave. So
17

 HAL SCHULTZ
he was on high. He drove straight thru from Long Beach to Latuda.
MT: In those days that would have been a pretty long trip! HS: A long trip in a big old Nash. So then the next year he went back alone and to finish up his flying and started from scratch again. Of course he really didn't have to start again from scratch. My mother got kind of upset because I got a crush on one of the girls in town that kind of had an "iffy" reputation. So she shipped me to California. She called him and said Hal is on his way with Uncle Frank. My Uncle Frank was driving down for the summer. He worked in the mines as an electrician. He went to California in the summertime to finish his schooling
or something. Dad said: "Don't let him come down here. We've just had that huge earthquake and everything is a mess. A big oil tank next to the airport blew up." She said: "I'm sorry, but he is on his way." So I wound up in Long Beach. Dad wasn't too happy about it but we survived. I guess I was a reasonably well behaved kid. He was very, in spite of his sternness, kind hearted so we shared. He took me to the pike and various places and I hung around the airport. I found some balsa wood and I whittled out a propeller and a fuselage, a tail and wing and made a little airplane that I put up for a wind vane at the corner of the hanger. I did a pretty good job for
18

 HAL SCHULTZ
the first time. The operator, George, was pleased. One day he said to me: "Have you ever been up in one of these things?" And I said: "No", and he said: "Let's go." We buckled into a little Great Lakes Trainer, an aerobiotic
machine, and he took me up and ran me through the mill. The whole aerobiotic routine, spin, the loops and hangovers and chandelles, and everything and I loved every minute of it.
MT: So that's when you really got turned on to flying?
HS: So anyway, Dad sent me home on the train and he went and got his private license and in the process they had flown to a couple of two and three different places in California for cross-country experience. So in the meantime he'd have Earl Robertson. Earl Robertson is from Castle Dale, I think. He worked in the Liberty Mine as a machine operator, and he had owned the Eagle Rock biplane at one time. He still had it but it was in the barn somewhere. Dad paid him that summer, while the mine was shut down, to go down and grade that piece of land he leased from the county. He graded a runway with a hump in the middle of it like that. The only thing they could
find and they built a hanger. So Dad came home and his pride and joy was to go up in a Biplane with open cockpits, red and silver, a real beauty. I'11 never forget that day, it was a speck in the sky, right on
19

 HAL SCHULTZ
time. We'd been there for about an hour, I guess. He said he try to get there about two in the afternoon and he got there at three. You could follow the airways, they had those beacons. Of course he wasn't flying at night, but he could see those orange bright things.
MT: And he flew that plane in from where?
HS: From Long Beach. He stopped in Las Vegas over night. That
was the first legitimate airplane landing in Carbon County. As I said earlier there had been some barnstormers land in the corn fields or alfalfa patches. That was the beginning of the flying bug in Carbon County and of course we got a lot of people interested. And he got Jim Lund, who he had met the second year and who taught him the maintenance of an engine because he knew he wouldn't have a mechanic. So he learned to take care of an engine. He talked Jimmy into coming up here and opening a flight school and he was quite successful. Bob Ferguson, the big ice cream magnet from Price bought a plane and those were the -three that were destroyed in the fire. I'll never forget the night the fire broke.
MT: Everything in the airport burned? HS: Yeah!
MT: And what year was that?
HS: That would have been in January '34. MT: That hanger had just been built.
20

 HAL SCHULTZ
HS: Yeah, it had been in operation since August, July or
August. I slept in the room in Latuda in our house that had the telephone. Our ring was one long and two shorts. But I was a sound sleeper so I didn't hear the telephone. Finally, about 5:30 in the morning Val Turri came up and pounded on the door. I got up and he said that phone has been ringing all night, I thought I'd better come up and see why nobody answered it. They were calling to tell him about the fire. He was pretty disheartened. But he decided if he was going to fly, he said to accommodate the family, he bought a cabin plane, or enclosed cockpit, a 4 seat Biplane. He bought it from the Luzier Cosmetics Co. in Kansas City, but he didn't have the time or the experience for that type of airplane, so he sent Jim Lund back to get it for him. Jim flew it in from Kansas City without incident and Dad got down there just before dark that night to take a look at his new airplane, and that's all he got was a look. Next morning, Jim, without authorization, took it out to give some friends a ride. The engine quit and they wound up upside down in the corn patch. Jim and his wife were like magic when it came to building and rebuilding airplanes. They worked day and night and of course they had to major overhaul the engines and the propeller for the straightening and rebuilt the wings where they were broken. Everything ship
21

 HAL SCHULTZ
shape and recovered and repainted. She did the recovering and most of the painting, I guess. She could make magic with a needle and thread and fabric. So they did it in a remarkable short time, but, it left Dad two days before the planned departure for New York with my mother and my sister to visit her relatives. This was really a big adventure and he had no experience with this type of airplane. You know, in an open cockpit is flying with the stick in this hand and the throttle in this hand. And you get in the cabin and you got to throttle over here and the wheel in this hand, big old round steering wheel. It was a luxurious airplane in those days, it had big round steering wheels and glass windows that rolled up and down like a cadillac. He had four hours experience in those two days. But then, fortunately, there was a young pilot who was working for Jim and he decided he would like to see his mother in Chicago. So he went along... They had a wonderful trip to New York. The gasoline cost, I think, 16 cents a gallon. They complained they stayed over night in Nebraska City, Nebraska. They complained that the hotel was all right, but the damn cab drivers charged them 75 cents to take them to the airport. They thought that was terrible .
MT: Hal, just out of curiosity, what would a plane like that cost in those days?
22

 HAL SCHULTZ
HS: Well, it was used. The first one cost $4,000 and it had
been used for a year, it had been very well taken care of. The second one I think cost somewhere between $5,000 and $6,000.
MT: Now, we have a picture in the museum of that trip, don't we?
HS: Of Ilene and her chipmunk.
MT: Exactly! We have a picture of that.
HS: Well, when I put those pictures together, I wasn't
thinking of the Schultz family monument, I was thinking of the aviation history of Carbon County, but there is enough of the Schultz family in there because that was the history.
MT: Exactly! And it was your dad who got it started!
HS: There was an article in the paper that said "Latuda builds airport in Price" . That was kind of intriguing. He looked at the idea of making a strip up here just the
other side of the Utah Railway bridge, just beyond I think you call it New Helper now. Anyway, just in that valley, just the other side of the bridge, there is room for a strip there.
MT: By the Castle Gate subdivision?
HS: Yeah, up above there about 2 or 3 miles, 'like I said, it
would be west along the railroad track there was a place there you could built a nice level runway. You wouldn't
23

 HAL SCHULTZ
have to fly like that... Anyway, they had a fine trip, they went to Roosevelt field, which was kind of a shrine, it is now Laguardia, that's where Lindberg departed from on his trip to Paris. They went to a big league ball game, that's my Dad and sister were both fans, baseball. And then they went back to Syracuse and picked up Mother and headed for home. They got into some terrible, it was a hot summer day, and that's bad. They shouldn't have been flying in the middle of the day, but he was anxious to get home, they got into some terrible turbulence going down Emigration Canyon, just about made them all sick. Scared the hell out of all of us. We wanted to come off that airplane.
There was a lot of flying activity, there was a flying club. It was a rich man's hobby then, obviously. They would get together and fly into Price, Vernal, Richfield, to Provo for fly ins, they called them air shows in those days. They'd get everybody to come in that could come in and they'd sell rides for a dollar or whatever and tried to make a little money each one of them, tried to share the market. So they got invited to an air show over in Montrose .. So Dad took Matt Gilmore. Did you know Matt? He was a leading citizen of Price, I forget how he managed to make his money, insurance or something, I guess. At any rate, his son, Sandy Gilmore,
24

 HAL SCHULTZ
you hear him on TV from Beirut and places like that, but he was in the front right seat and two other people, I forget who they were, there were two other men who were flyers. Matt was learning to fly but he was terrified. He had no business forcing himself to learn to fly. This airplane, which is fairly common practice until the '60s, it had rudder pedals on both sides, but for the control column it came up in the middle and came over to the wheel, and you just pulled the button and threw it over to the right side if you wanted your student to. The instructor was usually on the right side and if he wanted the controls he'd just take them. They went to Montrose and the airport was up on the Mesa there. Airplanes didn't have flaps in those days, they'd slow down or they'd side slip. You tip the airplane like this, and I still do it, from old habits, and slide down like that until you got down where you'd want it and then straight down and land.
MT: Really! Isn't that sort of dangerous?
HS: It's a breeze. They don't teach modern student these days
how to do it, but I find it very helpful. Sometimes flaps wouldn't do the job. But at any rate, he'd done the final approach to this Mesa. It was common practice then to come in high, because the engines were tricky in those days. If your engine coughed instead of roaring when you
25

 HAL SCHULTZ
needed it you were in trouble. Come in high, with engines idling, and side slip down to the altitude you wanted. So he puts it into a slip down to where he wanted it and he couldn't get it out. They just slid right into the air strip. Fortunately those big old wooden wings out there took the shock, they just folded up like an accordion and took the shock. In a modern airplane it would probably kill them all. Dad broke his nose and was unconscious for a little while. He hit the steering wheel, I guess. Dad was very kind, he said we must have hit a down draft. The fact was Matt froze, he went like this with his feet on the pedals and he had more pressure, he had it down to the floor because Dad had put it down for the side slip. He just stiff legged it and Pop couldn't get it out. There was no way he could. That was the end of that airplane, because the boss, Ross Weber in Salt Lake... got the Board of Directors to lay down a decree. They said we've got too much invested in you and all these 20 odd years, we can't afford to have you get killed in one of those fool flying machines.
MT: They told your dad this?
HS: He invested his life into making them money, but they had
a big investment in him . Well , of course they didn't want t o l ose him . People were very fond of flying those days. We were talking about Dad winding up his flying career.
26

 HAL SCHULTZ
He flew, like he went back to Cincinnati on a mining convention to give a presentation. Those beautiful slides, that are lost forever, that breaks my heart. But anyway, he flew back there to the big airport... airport, he'd fly from Salt Lake to Price. Half an hour here and hour there. Then he got the bad news from the doctor, he had a little heart problem and he may not try to pass the physical next time. So he just quit.
MT: So basically, how many number of years did he fly?
HS: Well, from '32 to '39, I guess.
MT: And in that period, he really helped to build up ... ? HS: Oh yeah, he was a strong supporter. He went around with
Jim Lund various air shows in the state trying to promote flying in general and locally did some convincing of people they ought to go out and try it.
MT: So did Jim Lund build the airport out here? Did he run that airport?
HS: Well, no, Dad built it or had it built. He got Jim Lund to come up here and establish the flying school and gave him rent free and everything. And of course the fire wiped him out. And there is a little chapter there. I don't know where Jim got the money, but he went to California and a bunch of us, I don't remember who all was involved, but we frantically built a garage out of odds and ends, scraps from the fire, it was the funniest
27

 HAL SCHULTZ
little garage you could ever imagine. We had our specifications. He came back with an airplane that had folding wings. It was a low-wing two place open cockpit trainer and when you were through flying you'd take a couple of bolts out, fold the wings up along side like this along the fuselage and we'd push it back into this garage to keep it out of the weather for the night. And then, of course, the WPA got started quite rapidly. In those days there wasn't so much damn red tape and you could get the project done if you have enough congressional support the WPA would start it right now. So they started building that beautiful stone hanger, I don't know why they ever destroyed that thing, it was such a beauty. So then he had various airplanes, I don't know what he did with the security airstrip and the low folding wing job, but he had an Eagle Rocket at one time and a travel air. Then he bought a big Focquor, it was called a Focquor airliner. It was about an 8 passenger job with about 300 HP, high wing. Built in this country under fogger license, Focquor was a big dutch airplane factory. And Jim flew that around selling rides for 99 cents. He'd go to an air show in Grand Junction and Richfield and Vernal or some place. Everybody wanted to ride in that huge airliner, you know. He'd find some money at 99 cents a ride.
28

 HAL SCHULTZ
MT:
HS:
So, Hal, was that first airport where the airport is today?
No, it's out where the fairgrounds is today. That is where the first airport was. Of course, with the war looming they started the civilian pilot training program, CPDP, they had to have an airport with a flat runway and no hump in the middle and more than one runway. So that's when they started building a new one out there. And I was not much into flying during that time. I was off to school and then off to the war and one thing or another. So you didn't learn to fly at that time?
Oh, yeah, we, some of us got together, and this was at the old airport, when one of the WPA hangers was functioning, we, 10 of us got together, there was Mabrito, what was his first name?
John Mabrito?
Yeah, John, and Joe Fazzio, Don Childs and I, and you
know, I can't think of the others, but there were ten of
us. I'd been working down in Emery County, starting a
line down there, and I saved a few bucks and narrowly
escaped. Anyway, we each put up $200, the pot was $2,000,
we bought a brand new Tailor Cub, which later became the
famed Piper Cub. At the factory in Pennsylvania, I think
r
MT: HS:
MT: HS:
it was $1,300. Jim Lund went back on the train and flew it home for us and taught us all how to fly. And so I
29

 HAL SCHULTZ
soloed December the 4th, 1937, just before I turned 18. One club member that wrecked the airplane twice. The first time we dug up some money and had it rebuilt, the second time we, the wives were on the rampage. Johnny Mabrito's wife didn't know he was flying at one time and when she found out she didn't like it. And what was her name, Carrie. I don't know about Don from Price, he is the one who piled it up both times, so we quit. I don't know whatever happened to the airplane, rather it was junked or rebuilt or what. I flew occasionally, I went to visit my sister in California and when I got to Van Nuys airport, there was a brand new Ronka. This would be the same kind of transition that Dad went through from the open cockpit Biplane to the cabin plane, except the cab was enclosed, but it was stick and throttle. The Ronka had a wheel and a throttle over here and I had to fly with my left hand instead of my right hand. Well, I told the guy I'd never flown that way before. He said I just looked at your log book. Anybody that can survive flying all those mountains in Utah can probably fly anything, go ahead. So I went flying, taught myself. That's really the way I learned to fly, becauss the law said you had to have 8 hrs. dual instructions before you soloed. Jim Lund walked out on me at 2 hrs. and 10 minutes. He said you don't need any more. So I really taught myself, I came to
30

 HAL SCHULTZ
him for some specific training. Occasionally we would buy the gas for the airplane instructor if we needed one. I had what they called a solo license. You could fly any place in the United States with it, but you couldn't take anybody with you. You had to pass the flight test for a pilot license to do that. I was all ready for that, and the Federal inspector was coming down and several of us were lined up to take the flight test. Paul Walton, big man in oil in Salt Lake all these years. He was a young man then, just out of college and working for, not the BLM but for the ... Conservation Service, I believe, SCS. And he learned flying in Ronko, the Biplane. So he got first, he was first in line, because he had made the appointment for this fellow to come down. So they went out and one of the few things they made you do on the flight test was simulate a forced landing. And they always surprised you. So, they were popping along and this inspector in the front seat pulled the throttle and hollered into the little speaking tube we had, he said:
"Forced landing". So Paul followed all the rules, checked to make sure he could get his engine started again, found a good spot, set up his approach coming into this corn field and landed the plane with little or no damage, hopefully and just kept on going. The damned inspector never opened the throttle. So Paul had no choice but to
31

 HAL SCHULTZ
land in the corn patch. It turned out the corn patch was muddy. They hit the mud and over on their back they go. This inspector had kind of gone to sleep, he was sick. He was asleep or sick, I'm not sure which. He had a brand new pair of white and brown wing tipped shoes on, he wasn't about to go into that mud, he made Paul carry him up to the farm house. And of course that was the end of flying for that day. I never got my private license before the War. I don't know why, I guess, just circumstances. Anyway, I got ready for it again, I took the written and passed that but not the flight test. So, at any rate, from there I'll be getting into the war years. So what do you want to do, back up and some more Latuda first?
MT: I did want to ask you before we leave your dad if you want to talk a little bit about how did your dad get along with the men during the strikes?
HS: They got along fine, they never did strike Latuda until later when Lewis had it organized and had firm control. When he called the strike everybody walked out.
MT: That would have been after '33?
HS: Right. In the earlier days they never struck Latuda and
when they        Spring Canyon's Standard and Peerless, I guess It was, and they had the big mob of miners and families blocking the road at the railroad crossing in
32

 HAL SCHULTZ
Spring Canyon, they hired Jim Lund to come up there and buzz them in his big WACO and try to scare them into breaking up. Some of them hit the ground flat, he flew so low, it's a wonder he didn't hit the tipple. But he didn't scare them. We used to drive through and Dad would always talk and chat with the miners, they were also on very pleasant grounds. At any rate, he was a good boss. So there were no problems there. I'll never forget the day they ran those miners and their families and took them to the bull pen. I was in High School, sophomore. Now, that would be the '33 strike?
Yeah. I was a sophomore, I guess. And they didn't let us out for lunch, they just told everybody to stay in the room and keep the class going. I think I was in Merrill's geology class, I think, or something . At any rate, we had no idea what was going on. What was going on is they were trucking all the people to the bull pen and they didn't want the kids to see where they were. We had to stay until 2 o'clock, until the last truck had gone. They didn't want the kids out there seeing their parents.
So where was this bull pen?
MT: HS:
MT: HS:
MT:
It was up to where the college is now, a little park, not a park it was kind of a little fairground. Well, it was the fairgrounds, yeah, that was the county fairgrounds. Where the college is?
33

 HAL SCHULTZ
HS: Yeah, right around in that area some place.
MT: Oh, that is interesting.
HS: That was the county fairgrounds. It was fenced for
baseball games, I guess. So all they had to do is run them in and shut the gate. I guess, after a couple of days, well, not a couple of days but a few hours, the judge decided that was not right and he turned everybody loose. I       know if they gave them a ride home or not. But they had rounded those people like cattle. Sheriff Beebe and his crew.
MT: So they didn't keep them there very long!
HS: I don't think they kept them over night, no. I would swear to it, but I'm pretty sure they did. My memory is
not that good, but they sure didn't keep them out there
in the baseball park for two weeks.
MT: That's exactly how they picked them up. From a couple of
stories I have gotten. They just picked anyone up,
actually.
HS: Well, there was this big group of pickets at the railroad
tracks on the highway base. They sent a posse, deputized people, over the mountain from Price Canyon and over the mountain from Consumers to block any way from escaping up the canyon. And then they came up the main road with the main Sheriff's Posse and just had them blocked in every direction. They just rounded them up and had them get
34

 HAL SCHULTZ
into the trucks, I guess. But no, he got along fine with the miners, I think he was always a pretty good boss. He had his bigotry, his problems and little things, but I think as far as humanity goes he was pretty keen on treating people right. Well, I don't remember of him ever having any real friction with the men in Latuda. There could have been some I didn't know about, but--
MT: Why don't we go back, Hal, before we go into your war years and talk about your life in mining camps!
HS: You know, in those days, and I guess it's still true. MT: I guess I just wanted to ask when your dad stopped
mining? Did he retire or did he die?
HS: He retired a year before he died. He retired in 1952, I
think.
MT: So he ran Latuda all during the Second World War?
HS: Yeah, he was, well they promoted him in 1942, he became
General Manager and moved to Salt Lake. And that's when he hired Slim Williams as superintendent. He used to drive out every week for a couple of days. So he ran the company then until '52.
this Social Security he'd been paying on, because he was 35
From Salt Lake? From Salt Lake.
MT:
HS:
MT: And then he retired in 1952?
HS: He said he couldn't wait to retire and get back some of

 HAL SCHULTZ
one of those hard line Republicans that said Franklin Roosevelt was bankrupting the country. So he got a year of it.
MT: Bless his heart!
HS: Just over a year, I think. About 13 months, I think he
got checks.
MT: Well, ok. Lets go back to when you were a kid in school
in Latuda.
HS: Well, as I said, it was a great place to live. The only
church activity was LDS and they had all of the usual programs. I remember being a Trail Builder, whatever that means.
MT: That was Mutual?
HS: No, Latuda, but the mutual program of the church, or
something like that, I get confused. And then there was an expert carpenter that came out and drilled, he ran a drill into the mine during the winter. He went back to Provo and went to summer school because he wanted to be a school teacher. And he became a very fine school teacher. And that's the way he did it, he worked in the mine and they would pay him to stay, that would be up to about three days or more, a. week. The accommodations weren't too bad, and when it was time to go to school he'd go to school. I'm trying to think of his name, I'll know it in a minute. But anyway, he taught us to make
36

 HAL SCHULTZ
tool boxes out of the powder boxes from the mine and things like that. He helped me build myself a work shop, and I don't know what else we did in the program. They'd have community dances. I remember the barber played the banjo and old Bill Baird played the bonest. And I can't remember who played anything else in that orchestra. When it was a dance night, well, they were really flying high.
And it was in the school building, so there was no drinking. And we used to have a good time, whole families, you know, Dad and Mom would be dancing right past their kids.
MT: Did your mother and father go?
HS: Occasionally they went. I think Dad had a remarkable
ability to be friendly with all of the workers, but retain a slight aloofness that he had to have to be their boss. So he didn't join in everything, but I remember he would sometimes. Then we hiked the Beaver, camped over night up there. I was always a loner, I remember camping on top of, instead of going down into Beaver, camping on the ridge up there, you could hear the coyotes howling. I would just go up there by myself with a bed roll and some bacon and stuff and camp out over night. I wasn't always a loner, but I was doing it alone a number of times. And then I had good friends, Herbie Gill and Parley White, Taski and Brent Davies was my friend until
37

 HAL SCHULTZ
he made that slur about Taski's eyes. And then... Well, anyway, we'd pack a lunch and go up Echo Canyon, which is the canyon on the right side of Latuda, and go up there. That was a dead end canyon, cul de sac at the end. And once in a while we'd pack a lunch and take our .22s and go all the way, climb over the mountain and come down in Price Canyon and hitchhike home. That's after we were 12, 13 years old. So we raised rabbits. We always had dogs.
I had a beautiful golden shepherd, half shepherd, no, half collie, I mean, not shepherd. He liked to be my faithful companion for years until he died of old age. He had suffered a number of accidents on the highway, and one on the railroad tracks. The one on the railroad tracks severed one of his legs, it left some skin there. My uncle patched it back together and splintered it, we'd have to splinter it every day because the dog would chew it. It finally healed. It was crooked, he limped, but he had his leg back. It was pretty remarkable in those days. All he did was stick it back together. They didn't have any technic.
MT: So, how big was the school up there?
HS: Well, we had a Junior High eventually, I was going to
say, in those days, as too many cases now, a person got into politics for selfish reasons. And I have to say it, Dad thought that the kids in the camps should have some
38

 HAL SCHULTZ
opportunities so he got on the Carbon School Board, got to be President of the Carbon School Board. He got the Junior High School started in Latuda. For Latuda, and Rains, Mutual, and Standardville. I don't remember if the Spring Canyon kids went to Helper or, I think they did. At any rate, there was a big duplex building next to the school which is made out of sandstone, the duplex is out of frame and so forth. It was originally built for teachers quarters. But they moved the teachers up the street a ways and made that into a manual training shop, one half of it, and the other half was like home economics and the things you do in Junior High, I forget what they all were. So it was quite a school, and the kids walked. I was laughing the other day, I saw. They are always laughing at us old timers when we boast that we had to walk through 3 ft. of snow to get to school and here is a picture of the trough in the snow that was between my house and the school. And I guess the snow must have been 3 ft. deep and where we'd shoveled it was 5 ft. and I was about this big, but I wasn't in the picture. But anyway, we did have some humongous snow
storms and we had some very sad snow slides, resulting in
death for a number of people.
MT: Yeah, that happened in a lot of the camps.
HS: Yeah, the south side would pick up the sun and the stuff
39

 HAL SCHULTZ
would just start to slide. It wiped out several houses. It removed one house from the back road across from the railroad tracks behind the road, but it was all in one piece. It imprisoned one little girl in the privy, packed her full of snow, just absolutely packed her into that thing with snow and turned her upside down. I remember the guys joking about her little bare bottom sticking up out of the snow.
MT: Did she survive?
HS: Yeah, they got her out and she survived. Just a lot of
embarrassment. Not Mr. Gamby but another fellow became the barn boss, and he and a couple of other people, I think Clarence Reed, might have been one of them, were moving his family out because they were anticipating snow slides. The snow slide came and killed the mine boss. And then I remember, a slide at the mine, they were using, I don't know if they hadn't finished the rock tunnel or what, but they had a check cabin at the top of the tramway where the men hung their checks when the went in and the slide took that out and killed the mine foreman, Gus Goodart. I guess that was really the only fatality. But, we did have a lot of snow, but it was a long way to go for those kids from Standardville.
MT: How did they get up there? HS: Walked, they only walked.
40

 HAL SCHULTZ
MT: They didn't have any transportation?
HS: They didn't have any transportation. Just to go back a
little bit. A couple of anecdotes. I told you about Mrs. Niwa. She was Tara Tjo Imamoto when she came from Japan. And she'd been through high school in Japan but they'd put her in the 3rd grade with me to learn English. And of course she was a little big for those seats. But she stayed in school until she learned about as much as she thought she could learn about English and then, I remember her father, who is, well they called him the
"Jap boss". He was very genteel man, Mr. Imamoto. He always consulted with Dad on many serious things. He came down to announce he had found a husband for his daughter, June. And he was a man from, I think, Montana, Mr. Newa and he had been in the cleaning business and he had saved his money and he had $800, so he was a pretty good catch for her. That started them in the business down here. I don't suppose they'd mind me telling about the secrets of their lives, I hope. I'll probably never see them. Newa is long gone. Then I remember we didn't get to church very often because it was in Price and the road up the canyon was very poor.
MT: Now, is your        Catholic, Hal?
HS: My mother was Catholic, my Dad didn't subscribe to
anything. So, he would drive us to church occasionally.
41

 HAL SCHULTZ
Then Mom actually got up the courage to drive down. I remember Father Joe, who became Monsignor Giovinono, a very influential man in the Catholic church in Salt Lake.
I remember one scene on the front porch. He had come on a Sunday afternoon. It is interesting, by the way, that Father Joe was an uncle to Kathy Hodgekins, who was my assistant in the Community Action Program and became my successor. But, at any rate, I remember that scene on the front porch on a Sunday afternoon. He'd come up, he was heading up money to build the Notre Dame School. And, I don't know, I think Dad was pretty generous, he must have given him 50 bucks or something, because he sure got a lot of blessings. He said, it's people like you and the Mormons that give the money not those tight wad Catholics. Any way, from there eventually St. Anthony's was built, but we had all drifted away by that time. We never really got exposed to the Catechism or anything, so all I could claim was baptism for many years. But, I mentioned a little sojourn in Emery County where I had saved up some money to buy into that flying club. Dad and Earl somebody, I can't think of his name. Oh, Earl Ratcliff, decided to open a mine down in Emery County, way down south in Southern Link Canyon to tap into the truck trade from Salina and Richfield. So I worked down
there for that summer. $3 a day, backbreaking work out 42

 HAL SCHULTZ
there building a tramway. Boy, that was a tough summer. The guy I had to work with was a brawny guy, he had twice the muscle I had, he was hard to follow, I tell you.
MT: How old were you, Hal?
HS: Seventeen! But the storekeeper down in Emery was also,
well his wife was the postmistress. They had a couple of daughters, one of them was married and lived in Ferron and the other was single and just ripe. Boy, that Mrs. Sorenson tried about every trick in the trade to trap me. She wanted me married to her daughter. There was no question about what she wanted. But, we carried on a brief flirtation, and then I got out of there. Couldn't stand the pressure. So, then Mike Gamber and Frank and so forth opened the Lone Pine Mine up here. Mike Gamber had graduated from school with a teacher's certificate, but he couldn't get a job anywhere. He was Frank Latuda's cousin, I believe. So he came out from Illinois. He was a brawny guy, so. But, at any rate, they opened the Lone Pine Mine and eventually I worked for them.
MT: Now, where was the Lone Pine Mine?
HS: Well, it became the Volcan Fuel Co., it was up the road
from, remember where the Mutual Store was? It was up that left canyon but on the right side of the creek. It was a couple of miles up the road. I don't remember just exactly when they opened that, but it's in that little
43

 HAL SCHULTZ
book, it's probably down here somewhere. Well, at any rate, I worked there and then war clouds came over and Dick got drafted in October 1941. I was going to school at the University, trying to get back with it and do something with it. I had a two year degree from Carbon College. That's what I was doing in that vacuum in my flying, I was busy earning money to buy gasoline to drive back and forth to school to Price to Carbon College. I was in that first graduating class. So I had a two year degree and I was trying to get some more time in at the University but Mike was really hurting for help since Dick was off in the army and so I eventually quit school and went back to Lone Pine sometime that winter. I volunteered for the Air Force, but they laughed at me because I wore glasses. I was going to volunteer to go to China and fly for $1,000 a month. Anybody who could get an airplane off the ground would get $1,000 a month. Hopefully they could get it back on the ground. Dad caught onto that idea and talked me out of it. Fortunately, because I probably would have been gone about 60 years ago or something like that. But anyway, Mike got me to promise not to volunteer for anything more and wait until I got drafted because he was hurting for help so much.
MT: OK, now Mike Gamber was running that mine? 44

 HAL SCHULTZ
HS: The Lone Pine Mine.
MT: Who owned that mine?
HS: Well, Mike and Frank and my dad.
MT: Well see, I'm a little confused. Didn't Frank Latuda's
family own the Latuda Mine your dad worked in?
HS: He owned 1/3 of it.
MT: They were in on it?
HS: They were the ones, they might have owned between 1/3 and
1/2. There were three people involved, Frank Cameron, who was my Dad's uncle, Frank Latuda, who was Frank's dad and then Ross Weber. He was strictly an office man, he wasn't a coal mining person.
MT: So then your dad and Frank and Mike Gamber opened up another mine?
HS: Dad picked up a lease from the county tax sale and Mike needed a job. That was before the war boom even started. And so they opened a mine up there and assembled a whale of a crew. They had three Ferderbers, I        and Scott Beveridge and Fin Ralston from Clear Creek or Scofield. And I forget who else was in the crew. They worked hard and they partied hard. Boy, every Friday night or Saturday night, whenever the. end of the week came, we opened a jug of booze at the office and finished off the week properly. And sometimes we get on a party, we'd go home, clean up and keep on partying until the wee hours
45

 HAL SCHULTZ
of the next day. And I remember one night chasing all over the county trying to find a kid, a young goat. So they decided they wanted to roast a goat for Easter. Crazy things like that: Well, at any rate, I worked there then until I got drafted in May of '42. And, like I said, they wouldn't even talk to me about flying because I wore glasses. They had their pick of the whole United States, they didn't have to fool around with somebody who had an eye problem, they just took the best. I don't know if they were the best, but they got the people with the best eyes. I went to basic training in Shepherdfield, Texas. The first month I loved it, I liked the drill and the rifles and pistols. And I like precision drilling, marching. But then that was over with and they didn't know what to do with me, so they put me on practically permanent KP for 30 days. And I tell you, I just about went AWOL a couple of times. I got KP about five or six days a week and that gets pretty discouraging after a while. But in the meantime I had asked for weather observation school. I had scratched out radio school, so they sent me to radio school. That's the way the army operates.
MT: The ones you scratch out are the ones you get?
HS: So I went to radio school in Scott Field. Turned out to be a great thing for me, I loved it and it was the
46

 HAL SCHULTZ
beginning of a great adventure. I had more fun, it's terrible to say you had a fun war, but it was for me, it was one big adventure. It was a hard time, sure, but we had some mighty good times. I went to radio school, I had a crash program. They didn't let me see inside a radio, how it looks or how to fix it or anything, just run it, operator, Morse code 20 words a minute on the typewriter or by hand. Boy, I tell you those das and dits.
MT: So, that was the radio in those days?
HS: Yeah, all Morse code. I got out of there and got assigned
to a squadron, 39th. . . in. . . North Carolina. Well, they'd been there training and dropping paratroopers and hauling gliders and expecting to go to Europe because they were on the East Coast. The army does everything backwards of course. I got there one day and the next day there was a radio operator they called 11 the preacher, 11 he was kind of lead man. He was a street corner evangelist from New York City. But he had a flight with a commanding officer to Georgia, and he offered to take me along and teach me the rudiments. So we went to Georgia and back that day and I noticed that the pilot and the co-pilot played cribbage all the way down and all the.way back and let the auto pilot do the flying for them. But, at any rate, the next day, half the people were on home leave, furlough, it wasn't Thanksgiving, but it was in October. At any rate,
47

 HAL SCHULTZ
next day they got immediate orders to head for the West Coast for overseas transshipment or whatever they called it. So, we didn't have enough radio operators, so they put me on an air crew. Left those other poor slobs back there, eventually they showed up on a boat six months later. Pure luck. But that night we were going into Mobile, Alabama. We were a dead head crew and the airplane ahead of us had three dead head crew. They had 16, we had eight. We didn't have any navigators at that time, we got them later. It was foggy and we made three passes at the Mobile airport and the third time, one of the dead head pilots hit the floor flat down and hollered, "Trees". And there were trees there. The pilot hit the flaps and throttles and landing gear and hit the trees, but we got out of there. We went to Montgomery and the plane ahead of us with 16 guys on it landed in a quartermaster parking lot, killed all 16 of them. And that was our first day out. That was terrible, a heck of a way to start. But I could just as well have been in
that crew as the other one, but I was lucky. So we went to Sacramento and got our airplanes upgraded, some different equipment put in them, some huge plastic fuel tanks, 2000 gallons worth in the cabin tied down with 2x12 straps.
By the time we got thru there, extensive work was 48

 HAL SCHULTZ
done on the airplanes, it was Christmas time. Eileen was a weather observer at San Francisco airport, my sister Eileen. So we managed to get in touch. I wasn't supposed to talk to anybody because we were on secret mission and immediate orders, but she managed to talk her way through the gate and I got out and we had Christmas, a pre- Christmas dinner together. It was Christmas Eve. Well, no, this is after we flew. We got our airplanes finished, we flew to San Francisco where she was working and that's where she got in the airport. She was employed there and so we had that brief encounter and then a day or so later, we were just waiting on the weather, a couple of days later the CO called us all together and he said:
"Well, you leave tonight. You1 ll be the first crew to fly your own airplanes over." The ATC had already done it before. "You1 ll be the first squadron to fly your own airplanes over." And it could be a very rough trip, although the weather looked pretty good. He said: "I can only wish you good luck and give everybody a promotion." So, the Staff Sgt. made Flight Officers, the Flight Officers made Sec.Lt., the Sec.Lt. made First, the Sgt. made Staff and so on. I was .a Buck Sgt., I would have made PFC, Private First Class. There was a mixup in the paper work and I woke up the next day as a full Sgt. More luck, luck of the Irish.

 HAL SCHULTZ
MT: Now, you were on the troop transport?
HS: On a troop carrier plane. It had 21 seats in it, it
folded up, they were just aluminum buckets, they folded up against the side when you were hauling freight, stretchers or something.
MT: So, you couldn't carry that many men?
HS: We could haul 25 people. 21 people or about 6,000 lbs.
cargo in lieu of that many people. The old DC-3, the work
horse.
MT: Was that a DC-3 you were on?
HS: Yeah, C47, DC-3, the same thing. The one McArthur said
the airplane that won the war. He gave it more credit than he gave the bombers. But at any rate, we got away and we got to, I remember I was a smoker in those days, everybody, well nearly everybody, we just off of the runway and we detected a leak in one of our cabin tanks. So no smoking for 16 hrs. Our nerves were on edge, but we made it to Hawaii.
MT Sixteen hours to Hawaii?
HS: It was slow going. We were loaded so heavily, over loaded
so heavily, that we just went to the end of the runway and pulled the wheels up and flew out over the ocean. And the next day we_went to Christmas Island and the next day went to Johnston or one of those little islands. The next day Fiji, next day to New Calidonia, next day to
50

 HAL SCHULTZ
A ustralia, ... A ustralia. Stayed in Brisbane two days and half of our crews and airplanes, incl. lucky me, got assigned to go up and attach to another outfit in New Guinea. Right in the heat of battle of . . . So we went up
there and flew from dawn 'til dark, about 21 days, I
think.
MT: Transporting men?
HS: We'd take men, cannons, ammunition and everything else
over the Stanley Mountains and bring back the wounded,
prisoners.
MT: Your job was on the radio?
HS: I was the radio man, yeah. We had a crew chief, radio
man, copilot and pilot. We had a navigator for the trip across the ocean, but then there wasn't anything for him to do, so he got to be an office officer. They didn't need him flying over the Stanley's. Everything was in code. We did have some very weak voice radio for when we'd get right at home base. We could talk to the tower. Everything else was in code and the code changed every day. The radio man who forgot to get his code cards could get into a lot of trouble. One time I didn't have a code card. It wasn't that I didn:t, I hadn't forgotten, I couldn't because we were stranded overnight in a place where we couldn't get them so we just took a chance and went back to Brisbane and boy, I tell you, they didn't
51

 HAL SCHULTZ
like it. The lights went out, the lights that were still on. They had a blackout condition, but there were still a lot of lights. Everything went black. And all the search lights started. They were going to shoot us down. We kind of talked them out of it. But then the big adventure, after that, was there was a Capt. Dmitri Smirnov and his dutch crew. He was a Russian by birth but a naturalized Dutchman. He was chief pilot for KLM Airways in the Indies and he flew out of the Indies just ahead of the Japanese with a DC-2 with women and children and some gold bars and stuff. He got shot down on the North Coast of Australia. And then he rounded up these other crew people, well, I guess they were with him. And he got assigned as a contract crew with our squadron, so he would get this turn just as any other crew. Well, one night he called in, said his radio operator was sick, would they give him a radio operator. They said yeah, we'll give you a radio operator. They picked me, because my name was Schultz, sounded a little bit like the Dutchman. The other three had Dutch names, you see. One of them was Schultz, come to think about it. So, went out there at 4 o'clock in the morning, got the airplane loaded. He came out all by himself. He said my other crew men got that bug too, and they are all sick. Can you crew this airplane? And I said, sure. He said let's go. So I
52

 HAL SCHULTZ
became the co-pilot, engineer, or crew chief, and radio man. And we took off on the doggonedest adventure. He could fly an airplane like he was driving a Jeep, just
second nature to him. The first approach we made at Townsville or some place. We were on the final approach, and he hadn't said anything, all of a sudden he said give me the brakes, give me the brakes. Well, he meant flaps. It didn't take me long to figure it out, but there was a hesitation there. So I gave him his flaps and then we crossed the Coral Sea, and about half way across he says, look, submarine. I thought, good God, we're really getting into it now. And he was pretending he was in a fighter plane, doing the strafing dive on the submarine. But when I got down to a certain altitude we could see it was two whales making love. It wasn't a submarine at all.
I don't know if he knew it all along and was just trying to scare me or if he thought it was a submarine. With that guy you couldn't tell. Then we got, wellá we went up to Darwin, it was about a 3,000 mile trip altogether.
MT: Just the two of you?
HS: Just the two of us. Me doing three jobs and him doing the
main one. It was quite an adv.enture. He had more flying time than any person in the world at that time, 20,000 hrs. I think it was. Most of it in DC-2's and 3's, and Lockheeds 660. They gave us a bunch of junk to fly and
53

 HAL SCHULTZ
took the other airplanes away from us there for a little while, half of them anyhow. We had some Lockheeds 660, we had Dutch writings for the instruments and the radios and everything. All the manuals, and not a word of English in the whole airplane. We just had to figure those out by ourselves. Just about every check we had an engine failure, a forced landing some place or a overnight some place. It was a big adventure.
MT: Now, you had to repair the airplane yourself, right?
HS: Yeah, when something went wrong.
MT: So, had you had any training?
HS: No, just working on Model A's and Model T's. I hung
around the engineers a lot because I liked that kind of work. So I knew, I could clean the filters and clean the sumps and clean the spark plugs if necessary, and do things like that. We didn't have any problems, just drain the sump, pull the safety pins out of the landing gear and take the locks out of the controls and away we'd go. And back on the ground we'd put the locks and the safety pins back in. That was the big adventure. Aside from that
first six, well it was more than 21 days, it was more like 31 days, that first pitch in New Guinea. And we won the battle of Guienna and we carried out a lot of prisoners and wounded, and sick. One time we had to move a contingent, I guess it was a platoon of nurses. They
54

 HAL SCHULTZ
were moving a hospital and we got to take the nurses to their new station. And they had a big farewell party the night before and so they all got sick that day. Everyone had a helmet in their lap. I tell you, that was no fun. Twenty-one of them. One adventurous day, my co-pilot was 20 years old, I mean the main pilot was 20 years old. He wanted, and he had flown a lot, he wanted to tell his mom and dad he had 1,000 hrs. in the air on his 21st birthday. So we flew, and we flew. I mean, we hurried up on either end, we helped load and unload, so there would be minimal delays. And they were defending a little airstrip at Wau. There was a gold mine up in the mountains and the airstrip was on the side of the mountain. It was so steep that you had to land and get your airplane turned around before it quit rolling. If your stop came up the hill you would never get that airplane turned around, you didn't have enough power. We brought in cannons, 75 mm cannons. And the Australians would grab them off the airplanes. By the time we got everything unloaded they were shooting. For a while we had Australian soldiers and fuzzy wuzzies to unload and load the wounded and so forth.
MT: What were fuzzy wuzzies?
HS: That's a native population, New Guineans, the Papuans.
They called them Fuzzy Wuzzies, they had bushy hairdo's. 55

 HAL SCHULTZ
But at any rate, it was a big adventure and I was going to go all the way to Japan. The patriotic fellow wanted to help win the war. Well, one day at... they rotated out all of our favorite pilots, send them home because they had their time in. And there was one fellow that had been with this squadron for about three months, he was from Provo, Utah. He had a superiority complex that stunk. They'd sent us some glider pilots, they'd been taught how to fly gliders. Of course they had flown in single engine trainers and things, but they'd never flown big twin engine airplanes like the DC-3, or the C47. So they sent them to us to train. Well, this guy had one of these fellows this morning and the normal procedure would be to complete a ground check, everything before we got ready to take off. Well, this smart aleck dispensed with all that and said, let's go. Well, here is this little guy that never flew on these big machines before sitting up there. And this smart aleck tried to be a Captain Smirnov, tried to do everything himself, but he wasn't capable. He got clear to the runway. Instead of giving us the signal, either the co-pilot, me or the crew chief, anybody. That would mean wheels up. Instead he goes like
this. You know what happens if you do this in a car, don't you. He reached down to get the tape and he automatically turned the other direction. He flew us
56

 HAL SCHULTZ
right into the trees, right into the palm trees. We wound up impaled in palm trees, about 15 ft. off the ground, above the engines on fire, and both doors jammed. We got out thru a hole in the side that had been ripped open by one of the palm tree stumps. We got out just before the thing really blew. So I just marched up to the orderly room and told the captain up there I'm going home. I knew I had enough points I could go home if I wanted to. I said I was going home, I had changed my mind. I'm not going to fly with these damn fools any more. So I came on home. I was supposed to get home for Christmas in '44, but I didn't. We wound up on this little boat and I got home a couple of days after New Years in '45. After home leave, I got assigned to Santa Ana, Ca. R&R. They had a different name for it then but I don't know what it was. Rest and Recreation, Recooperation, whatever. There is a little story that ends there. It started in San Francisco. They hailed us all in for a physical exam before taking off for overseas. And oh, I'm in trouble. Because my eyes then were terrible. I could squint and
read the big E, they were that bad. They corrected OK, but they were terrible without correction. And now they are 20/50, I'11 pass the commercial physical. At any rate, I sweat that thing and sweat it. Wpen my turn in the line, there were a couple hundred guys in the line,
57

 HAL SCHUL TZ
when my turn came to go into the door of the infirmary,
I said I'm going to be sick I'll be right back. And I ran around behind the infirmary and I waited until the guy that was ahead of me came out and I fell in line behind him and they never checked up on me. In Santa Ana, I was pretty sneaky, but it was just another one of those bits of good luck that made the war so fun. In Santa Ana, the medical examiner said, well I said something about I sure hope I get some more flight duty, I wouldn't mind another overseas assignment. He said, Buddy, you aren't getting in another one of Uncle Sam's airplanes again. How in the hell did you get on a flight crew in the first place with those eyes. So I got assigned to radio maintenance in Las Vegas. I actually had to pick up a little radio maintenance. They didn't teach me anything but what I had picked up myself. So they assigned me to Las Vegas. I'd met Lela when I came home on leave. She was a blind date that my cousin had set up for me. He was going with a nurse and he asked her to find a friend who was willing to go on a blind date. When the blind date saw me she said I don't think so, because she was about 6 ft tall. Lela stepped into the void. .She was rooming with this tall girl. She said well I'll go. That's where it started. And then we corresponded a little bit and I got home for one 3-day weekend, I think. In May she decided
58

 HAL SCHULTZ
to go to California. She quit her job in Salt Lake at General Hospital and was going to California to do something. She promised to stop and see me on the way. Well, I trapped her. I wouldn't let her get out of Las Vegas. We sat out in the park one day and decided to get married.
MT: Great! So you were married in Las Vegas?
HS: She got her best dress ironed and her hair put up and we
found a JP and gave him 5 bucks, I think. He found us a couple of witnesses and that was it. No formalities, just.
MT: Were you in the service much longer after that?
HS: Until October. The only way we could get an apartment was to buy the furniture from a GI who was moving out and had to get rid of their stuff. That's the way it was done in those days. So we had to pay some terrible sum, like $600 just for a bunch of crappy old furniture. The mattress had a hole in the middle big enough to throw this dog into it. It was pure junk, but it was the only way you could get an apartment. So we did it. Lela worked at the local hospital. We lived there six months. Well, four months, I guess. And Las Vegas was a neat little town in those days. She walked to work at the hospital and home at night, never a worry on the streets. So we had kind of a fun honeymoon there. Then we came home, got discharged
59

 HAL SCHULTZ
in early October. I went to work for Mike, he was still hurting, there was still a demand for coal. They were hurting for help at the Lone Pine. Dick was still in the service, so they kept him 3 or 4 months longer than they kept me. I went to work for Lone Pine. I guess, I was loading trucks on the graveyard shift. They'd have a bin of coal left over at the end of the day. They were selling coal 24 hrs. a day, so they had to keep it moving. I lived in that little shack up there at night, in the little stone house. And loaded trucks on call from quitting time at 5 o'clock til starting time at 7 the next morning. I'd sleep until somebody came and rapped on the door.
MT: So where was Lela now?
HS: Well, Lela was a civilized lady from Richfield. She
couldn't imagine living in a coal camp. But she said she'd do it if we had indoor plumbing. There wasn't much of that going around in that Canyon. Andy Anderson had moved up there, he had a house across from Joe Pavignano's store up on the hill where Golden Day lived next to us, he bought that house and he put in a bathroom. Dad used his influence, pulled a little clout, which I was going to talk about before and didn't, but I will. He got Andy to give us that house. It became vacant. He had a tenant in there that left town and had
60

 HAL SCHULTZ
left kind of a mess, as I recall. Plumbing down in the hole under the house was pretty primitive. It certainly wouldn't meet today's standards. The bathroom worked and that was important. We lived there and Lela enjoyed the teaching of Joe Pavignano for years on, how to cook, different cuts of meat and how to make Italian spaghetti. To this day nobody can match her. Joe taught her all the tricks in the kitchen. Which is good, because coming from Richfield she'd never, I suppose maybe in the city she did, in Richfield they'd never even talked about Italian food or anything like that.
MT: They didn't know any Italians in Richfield?
HS: No, they didn't. So they ate bland foods. I worked there thru that winter to the end of Spring in '46. In the meantime, Dad had picked up this block of 160 acres at the tax sale. But unfortunately it was buried in the middle of that mountain up there and had a very narrow right of way to get up to it. The Day Mine was on one side and a streak of dirty coal on the other side. There
wasn't enough room there to pay it's way driving entries, but we struggled for years and finally got those entries driven up to the block of coal and we hit a big roll and wound up mining 28 inch coal, that's all we got through that thing. Plenty of headaches. But anyway, back to what happened. He made a deal with the Western Coal Mining
61

 HAL SCHULTZ
Co., which had bought the McLane Coal Co. before the war. I think they made a fortune on the wartime boom. They had people in charge who had never seen a coal mine before, so you can imagine how the management structure worked. It was zilch. They made a deal. They'd open up the mine at the new property, he'd furnish the property and some cash, I think, they'd furnish the equipment from the McLane Mine, which was shaker conveyors and... machines and Jeffrey post drills. It was all with shovels in those days. Except for the duck bill that we'd put on the front of the shaker conveyors that would help to get some of the coal out. But basically hand labor. So we struggled with that, those entries for years. We finally got to some decent coal, but by that time, having to haul it so far to make a switch from one hoist to another. So we got a plan where we had three hoists, loader head, little hoist and the big hoist that went to the outside. I had resumed flying, I was flying down here at the Price airport. One day, old man, this was early on, old man... was running the place, Dad kept telling him get some stoppings in there, get that air up to the face. And he wouldn't do it. He always had an excuse. And so this mine, the         had gone way beyond what they should have gone, which is bratisch stop. No stoppings. Dad took me in there one day and taught me how to lay cinder block
62

 HAL SCHULTZ
in one easy lesson. How to mix the mud and get the right consistency and everything. It's amazing some of the things he picked up over the years, but he taught me how to do it. So I went in and built a stopping. And I walked up to old Shockley the next morning and said here is your keys, I don't want to work for you any more. He was really offended that he got overridden that way. I put in stoppings for several months there and I drove truck. Dad had hired Geno Ori as mine foreman, he was superintendent and general manager. He'd lived in Salt Lake but he'd come out every week for a couple of days or so when he was needed. He did the surveying but then he turned it over to Albert Shaw eventually. Between the two of them they taught me the regiments of surveying.
So your dad was running Latuda at the same time helping you guys get into that other mine?
His boss got awfully upset about that but he stonewalled him. He said there is no place, I've got two sons and both interested in coal mining. Both are pretty knowledgeable and there is no place for them at Liberty Fuel Co., so I want to help them get started. Dad died in
'53, hunting pheasants. He had two pheasants on his belt and just sat down, the easy way to go. This was over in Vernal and Dick was with the hunting party. He called me. The man who had inherited the power at the Western Coal
MT:
HS:
63

 HAL SCHULTZ
Mining Co. Matt Dye was, he had learned as much as a banker can learn by coming out to the mine every couple of months and going through it, but there wasn't very much. So he clung to the title of general manager and made me superintendent, and eventually realized he wasn't functioning and gave me the title of general manager. He retained the title of president. We struggled with that thing and we got good coal, good quality, and a whale of a team of miners. We had the best mining team in the county, no question about that. We went through a lot of agony with the United Mine Workers, when we were struggling under these terrible conditions and they wanting us to hire more men and all. Of course, I had to do all I could to avoid that because, yes, it was a safety issue, but I didn't think it was that important and neither did some of the men. But eventually they beat us. During all of that power struggle we were friends with the P erri's and the O ri's and everybody else. A great bunch of guys. We finally got to the point where you just couldn't make it pay, it was good coal but it was too far to get it out. You had to get it out of the dips, which is an expensive . proposition and drop the outside. We opened up, backed out to the surface, and
opened up a mine in the A-seam up the canyon, a mine off the main entries just in by the portal off to the right
64

 HAL SCHULTZ
of the motor road. We put in a big new generator and got a motor, a locomotive and started off in that direction. I was basing my judgement on some very faulty information that Albert Shaw had given me about the coal over there. That dirty coal was supposed to be one little band, but followed the creek and then it was going to be nice coal behind that. Well, it didn't turn out to be the case. It stayed dirty, there was so much water that the roof went bad on us. And up the other mine, the A-seam, the coal was good, the roof was sound but it had bumps in it like this nobody had ever seen before. And that was kind of rough on the Jay Loaders' operators back and head and so forth. The coal depression started then and our prime product was stove coal, and then of course stoker coal. As long as we could keep the cutting machine out of the rock we had the greatest stoker coal. We were getting maybe $5.50 a ton for those products. That was like 25% of our production. And for the rest of it, we were selling slack to the government for $3.00 a ton. Utah Power was taking our dust for 90 cents a ton. They were
just killing us with the competition. They had us over a barrel. They knew they could get all the coal they wanted. The dealers knew it, the power company knew it, everybody knew it . They, beat us into the ground on prices. And all this other hard luck we had. We borrowed
65

 HAL SCHULTZ
money from the bank to buy some better equipment, big AC
MT: HS: MT: HS:
MT:
HS:
shovel cars and so forth. So at any rate, one day I went down, I was purely honest with the banker... He was a lawyer, he was on the Board of Directors. Therald Jensen, the banker, it will come to me. But anyway, we went out for coffee and I leveled with him, I said we got these things going against us, we're in deep trouble. We can't make our bank payments and pay the men right now. It is going to be a tough struggle, but I think we can make it. I wasn't very sure, but sure enough that I was willing to try like the devil because in the meantime the men all had invested money in it to get the Salt Lake people out of the company. They had a Board of Directors meeting. The banker told Therald Jensen what I had told him and
that was it. They had the right to off-set and got our payroll and everything else we had and of course the payroll checks all bounced.
I got one of those last night.
Yeah, Vince was passing those paychecks out.
That was in 1966.
April of '66. Twenty years from the time we started it. Well, why can't I say his name?
That's right, because Gene worked there before I started
teaching!
He wound up in the hospital in Holy Cross, where Lela was
66

 HAL SCHULTZ
working. And I went over to see him. He apologized for the whole thing, he said I know I made a mistake.
Who was this?
The banker. The mine was shut down and salvaged out by that time. And he was feeling pretty bad because he had a bad illness. I guess his conscience was getting to him. It should have Hal!
MT: HS:
MT: HS:
It should have because they stopped us dead in our tracks, there wasn't a place we could move, we went to SBA, they said you don't have asset one to give us, why should we give you any money. And that was the situation, they had taken everything .
Hal, I don't know why things like that happen but it seemed just the way it turned out, Hal, that you got into the CAPS program after that. And a great contribution you
MT:
made there!
HS: Oh, for me personally, it was probably the best thing
that could have happened, but I have had a lot of conscious problems with, even though I felt no guilt or no fault, I still felt really bad because of your husband and Mike Svetich and Vince Garavaglia and everybody else. They had put money into it. T.hey all survived.
MT: Everybody survived. They sure did, Hal!
HS: What we did, the reason those checks were, the story of
those checks that you got one of last night. We 67

 HAL SCHULTZ
immediately stopped putting money in that bank, obviously. We opened an account in Salt Lake and every time we'd get a check from a dealer or the government or somebody we put it in that bank and had some new checks printed and re-issued checks out of the Salt Lake bank. Everybody got their paychecks and their annual vacation pay. I think they got their vacation pay, I'm not sure. I know they got their paychecks. We were just in a box and there was no way out. And I don't know, if I would have been an Ivan Bosky for some high powered promotor, I would have gone and borrowed a couple of hundred thousand dollars from some poor sucker and opened up middle section two and drilled a rock slope down and opened up that Gordon Creek seam and had a beautiful block of coal to mine. But that kind of money wasn't around and I wasn't that kind of a crook. It would have been almost as much of a gamble as the Aseam was. That was the end of coal mining, except for a little contact with Mr. Wayne Baker. But anyway, Arnold Mathis, remember Arnold? He was on the County Commission. And of course I was still President of the School Board. And he worked for the School Board. So technically speaking he worked for me, very technically speaking. We didn't interfere with the help, actually, but he came up to the house one afternoon. He said, I was having a pretty hard time I had
68

 HAL SCHULTZ
a lot of trauma. He came up to the house and he said, you know, we're bringing in this CAPS program that the government has got to help pooh people. It is going to be a four county program, we've got commissioners and people from the four counties on the board that have put the proposal together. He said, I kind of like to see you take that job to run that thing, he said. There has to be somebody who can get along with those Republicans down in San Juan County, ho, ho, ho. That was a joke. But I had been Republican. Vince and I were delegates to the State Convention the year before. He said we have a meeting down in Green River and several applicants have to be screened. I sure wish you would apply for the job. I had been familiar with Head Start through the school system and I was familiar with the Neighborhood Youth Corp through a program Harry Mangus ran. Which was supposed to be part of the Community Action Program, as was Head Start, expect there wasn't any CAP here. As politicians will, he and Harry had gone and promised the job to six people        they even had a director. The only thing
they hadn't hired was a bookkeeper. I went to Green River with him and Mr. Guzman was the token poor person at that meetings real nice fellow but hand picked, not to give anybody any static. We got to the meeting and the chairman was at that particular time, I think it was
69

 HAL SCHULTZ
Marion Hazelton from San Juan. No, I forget. But anyway, apparently they had three applicants. Arnold said, well, you know we have three applicants. This one is a CPA from Monticello, a Mr. what's his name, commissioner, doesn't much like him. The other one is a woman, we don't want a woman running the program. Will you take the job? That's the way I was hired. There was no affirmative action in those days. I knew enough about it, I had read overnight
MT: HS:
some stuff. It was a challenge and it was exciting to do something to develop poor people's opportunities for themselves and get educated, and get jobs. So I took the job. On the way back, Mr. Arnold Mathis says well, you know we're funded for a bookkeeper and I've got this gal and she worked real good for me in the campaign and I suspect she'd make you a real good bookkeeper. And I'd read to the point where I knew you didn't do it that way, you weren't supposed to hire people the way they hired me. So I said I'm going to follow the rules. So I advertised the job and Arnold has been mad at me ever since. He was a pure politician.
Who did he want hired?
I can't think of her name, to.tell you the truth. He was a nice guy in other things, but he was purely political, he was like he worked in... So we didn't get along very well after that. They had hired these people, it included
70

 HAL SCHULTZ
I think Anna Tolich and Roselie Prettyman.
MT: Anna speaks of you when I interviewed her!
HS: Yeah, you know, Rose what, I can't say that one either,
she got her semi-professional credentials working for a
while for that department. They all progressed. Roselie
went to Salt Lake and married a guy with money... with no
help from me. So anyway, I set out to make the rounds. We
were supposed to have a meeting in each county, meeting
once a month with the Board of Directors. It was supposed
to be a County Commissioner from each county and a person
in poverty from each county, and another person from the
community from each county. Well, it boiled down to the
J
Commissioners running everything and you know, they hand picked a Navajo from San Juan who never opened his mouth. Probably didn't know what was going on, probably didn't understand the language, I don't know, but that was a fiasco to the point of community action, real community action. They informed me to go down to Monticello and have a meeting in the County Commissioner's Office and Cal Black and Marion Hazelton, I forget the other Commissioners name, informed me in no uncertain terms that my job was to get the federal money and I was to give it to      to spend. Because they knew what people needed down there, better than those people knew
themselves. I was told in essence to stay away from the 71

 HAL SCHULTZ
Indians. Well, that was a little too much to stomach so I sneaked around Blanding and went around Bluff and got acquainted with the people at St. Christopher's Mission.
And they introduced me to some Navajo people and I told them if they had a big meeting of the Navajo chapters wherever they wanted, across the river or wherever, I'd like to talk to them what community action is and what it can do for them, to find out what their needs were. This was a major event in Utah. The Navajo's had never been encouraged to say anything before. The meeting was scheduled across the river, it was scheduled for 10 o'clock and started at 4 o'clock, or something like that. That's the way they do it down there, they have to finish building the shade to keep the sun off and then they have to cook mutton and fry bread, do all those things before they start the meeting. The guy from Denver, my contact with the Feds tangled my purse strings, Guy Adams from the state office, Governor Rampton's Office of Economic Opportunity. Both decided they'd like to come down to that meeting to see what went on. So we went to the meeting and they saw what went on. We got through all the formalities and the... started and just sat there and listened. They talked in Navajo. They translated some of
it, but not very much of it. I knew four or five words in Navajo by then and I could tell by their inflections what
72

 HAL SCHULTZ
they were talking about. They used English words like "pre-school", "head start". The upshot of it was, they wanted a head start program, which we had already started, but it was in the Mission and in the schools. And I had to fight to get those in the Mission, but I did, I had to fight the community. They figured those Episcopal's were outsiders. Their little kids had to come down in their pickups to their swinging bridge and walk across the San Juan river on this rickety swinging bridge and then get picked up by a bus and driven over to the Mission. And further down they'd get driven from scattered places on the north side of the river into the Bluff school. They wanted a school on the Reservation, they never had one and they wanted one, so their little kids would have it easier. Some of them would ride the back of those pickups for 25 miles, crossing the bridge and then getting on the bus. I said, OK, what's your next greatest need. And they said, well, we'd like a bridge so we can drive our pickups across the river and won't have to carry all of our groceries and coal and everything across the swinging bridge. I said, well, that's a big project, but we'll see      we can do. But I had literally promised them the school and when we got in our cars to come home the guy from Denver says, you're a goddamn fool. And the guy from Salt Lake said, how are
73

 HAL SCHULTZ
you going to keep a promise like that! I said, well, I'm going to do it. The first thing you have to establish with people is trust. And I asked them what they wanted and they told me, they're going to get it. Well, I did a lot of funny things with the money. I bought 2x4's and
sheet iron out of the allocations for bus transportation because people where hauling their own kids, things like that. They were legal, but not quite in the program's scope. And got volunteer help from the Episcopal Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma. They sent out 45 kids and the preacher to help us build the school. Our family was
involved, Lela was down there running the clinic because their nurse had frozen her feet and they had no medicine. The doctor got sick and retired. And Howard was down there keeping the cement mixers running, the girls, Molly and. . . were doing their parts pouring concrete and putting up 2x4's. We built it and we had two Vista Volunteers who were working with the tribe. We picked them up, they were hitchhiking out along the road one day. One of them with a pronounced limp. We got acquainted with these two young ladies and one of them was a full fledged Early       Development teacher. And so when we got the school we hired her and we got a trailer for her to live in. We got a CB radio set up between her and the Mission and she lived out there all
74

 HAL SCHULTZ
by herself, miles from anywhere. It was about a mile to Tomboy's place. Tomboy was a Navajo who claimed ownership of this spread. And he's the one offered the land for the school. It was called Todahaidaa Kani, which means water on the hill under the tree, I think. What I didn't know was in giving us the land for the school he was laying his claim to the janitor's job. But it worked out, what the heck. I didn't know that was going to happen, but we worked it out. So Joanne ran the school out there. And in
the meantime, while we were building the school like crazy out there, driving our old Pontiac out over the slick rock to get to the site. I had a grant in for $250,000 for the program to start in September, year around program. The guy from Kansas City said, he called me one day, he said Schultz, I hate to tell you this, but we've run out of money, we've made a mistake and we don't have any money for your program. See, Head Start was an intregal part of CAP. So I said, you can't do that to us. He said I know I can't but I have to. I got a hold of Frank Moss, he got a hold of Ethel Kennedy. Ethel, and Ted Williams and somebody else had been down in the San Juan River rapids and they had seen the poverty down there and so forth. And they had glimpsed our summer program which was a dinky six-week introduction to Head Start, that's all it was. About a week the guy calls me
75

 HAL SCHULTZ
from Kansas City. He says, hey, you've got a special allocation out of Washington, earmarked for you. We had the program. I had to fight the community all the time. Cal Black, rest his soul, Hazelton and those other people, were incensed that we'd come in there and hire these Indians at a decent wage, but they'd been getting to clean up the beer cans along the road for the welfare grant. They were working long before Utah had any work welfare working those people. The sheriff was a leading conspirator in that, he didn't want us to hire any more Navajo's. I had some surplus money because parts of the program didn't even get started, so I got an amendment to the Education Program. I found a wonderful guy to head the program and found some ruins around the different chapters where we could hold the classes. The community was all enraged because we allowed smoking in the classroom, adult classes. I just thumbed my nose at them and it took about a month before the Navajo's informed me they had taken a vote in each chapter and they had all voted not to have smoking in the classrooms, because it interfered with their thinking. They were interested, they were hungry for knowledge. They wanted to know about space, the moon landing and space walk and all those kinds of things just fascinated them. Along with how to use English. We had a great program there, all Navajos.
76

 HAL SCHULTZ
I wouldn't let those Anglos into the program one inch. Of course, the Commissioners were getting mad and madder about the whole thing because I was running things and they weren't.
MT: Hal, it seems to me I remember you telling us how the Anglos came in and bought the hand loomed rugs for a pittance.
HS: They got to form a co-op and set their own prices on their rugs and their jewelry. And then we got those people that had sheep. Well, they all had sheep. Instead of fighting each other at the market to form a coop and sell profitably and get a decent price.
MT: Is most of that stuff still going on?
HS: I don't know, I think the co-op is, but I'm not sure. I
just don't know, I lost track of things. I had started the process with Frank Moss and Rampton in getting a bridge. Of course it was never a promise, but it was an inference I was going to do everything I would. So eventually they got the bridge. I had to pull some real shenanigans with the State, the County, the Government, everybody involved in this thing. They each had their own demands. The county wasn't going to put any money in unless CAP put some money in, and so I wound up buying fence posts and barbed wire with Head Start money. I had to do it. I had to get the politics settled down and get
77

 HAL SCHULTZ
the bridge built. We put in miles of fence, we didn't furnish the labor. We had some job money that we contributed, but it was welfare work.
MT: How long were you there?
HS: Five years, almost to the day. About a month short, I
guess.
MT: Why did you go to Salt Lake? What happened?
HS: Well, because I had organized the Navajo's and they were
speaking up and they were getting some things done. And they were looking to CAP as being the neat people. The Commissioners got so infuriated, they threatened to walk off the program. The "Green Amendment" had just been passed which said, local officials, if they don't like CAP, they can opt out. And say. CAP will not operate in our county, or our city, or multi-county or whatever. So they were going to opt out. Obviously I had became politically unacceptable. And if I stayed it was going to hurt the program bad. So, I had to leave. I hoped there was enough of a basis there to, we hadn't totally ignored Carbon and Emery County, but most of what we did in those counties and Grand County was hustle job money so we could hire people. Because that's what those counties wanted. They      not a homogenized group we could get our fingers into and organize. We had some very strong community councils in a couple of areas. But wherever we
78

 HAL SCHULTZ
started a Head Start Program in Emery County with zero money. Marie Tibet was her name then went out and hustled people and money. I fudged a little out of programs here and there, maybe 10% of the program cost, and she hustled the rest from the community and started a great Head Start Program which eventually got federal funds. But things like that were going on in these other counties. I had put on 184,000 miles on that little Mustang in those five years, in addition borrowing Buck Davis's airplane for probably 10,000 miles. I had one project that went clear to Trinidad, Colorado. I had two states, seven counties, five CAP'S and three tribes, all of them involved in this one massive economic program. It was a wonderful program. We had wood cutting co-op's, rabbit raising co-op's, all kinds of things going. We were setting up to have a group of low income people get financing for a ski area in the mountains. The Chicano movement in Colorado moved in on me. They ruined the program. It went down the tubes in a very short time. They, with the aid of a very self seeking rancher from, the town just above Trinidad, what was the name of it, they run the program. In the. meantime, I had quit and went to the city. I knew if I stayed the program would be hurt bad, and the Navajo people particularly would
suffer. They were just mean enough to do it. Cal Black 79

 HAL SCHULTZ
was a pretty voluble leader. I went to the city and got a job as a planner. Well, they gave me a pretty good salary for those days, $800 a month to start down there. Wayne Baker came in and offered me $25,000 to come and work for him, I said stick it where it's dark. He said you want to stay and work for your goddamn communists. That was it. I did design his first tipple up there, charged him a couple of hundred bucks. Just some spare time work I did. And then I washed my hands of it, I couldn't stand his attitude towards poor people and minority people.
MT: So, did he make you a Democrat?
HS: He certainly helped! Well, I had become a Democrat in the
meantime, because I had made, at the behest of Jimmy Banasky a television commercial for Senator Bennett's campaign as President of the Utah-Wyoming Coal Operation Assoc. with the blessing of the association. He would not respond. Frank Moss on the other hand would do anything he could to help poor people and minorities. It was the general idea of the wondrous concept of community action giving poor people the first chance they've ever had to sit down across the table, equal to, not subservient, about equal to       county commissioners. Their vote was as good as anybody elses if it was properly organized. Southeastern Utah never did get straightened up and out
80

 HAL SCHULTZ
from under political control. So when the Block Grant came in there it wiped the program out just like that. Unfortunately it hadn't had strong leadership, very weak leadership for the previous 2 years. So I went to work for a planner for 9,000 in Salt Lake. I didn't like the management, I guess it was pigheadedness. I had been the manager for so long I didn't like working for somebody else. Maybe that was it, I don't know. I bid on a job running their center out in Midvale, and that was fun. That was a big center, we had 16 employees out there. Just one neighborhood center. A lot of money around. Then Nixon came along and he said, get rid of that Community A ction Program. They gave me a lo t of headaches in California. Same tune Reagan sang to us in '80. The President said get rid of that program. He hired Howie Phillips of the Heritage Foundation to move in and kill CAP as quickly as possible and as painfully. That's what seemed to be the intent. So we fought them and some of us got together. We got together with a guy from Kansas, one from Missouri, one from New Hampshire, one from Pennsylvania. I forget who else. We found some money in our own pockets, under our own mattresses, so to speak. Plus, we found      to legally use traveling money out of the grant so we could go to meetings. So we entered a lawsuit against the Nixon Administration. We won. That's
81

 HAL SCHULTZ
how we survived that one. But in the meantime, Nixon had ordered the destruction of the CAP and we had close-out orders, five pages of orders on how to close this thing out quick. The guy that was running the CAP then said I can't stay with a sinking ship, it will look bad on my career resume, I'm quitting. The board came to me and asked me if I take over the run the program either fold it out gracefully with no harm to anybody if Nixon won or make a program out of it if he didn't. So I said I'll take the second choice. We had the same battle with Reagan when he came in, they gave him fits down in California because he was a hard headed reactionary. It's kind of interesting, he had at one time been a card waving Democrat, and then became a right wing Republican. Just the opposite of my search. We, in the meantime, had gotten smart enough to know that we had to do something in the Congress. We could never expect any help from the White House, because when Jimmy Carter was elected we thought wondrous things would happen. But Jimmy treated us, what I choose to call, benign neglect, he just didn't care. Don't know why, but mostly probably not informed. So we decided to build a base. in Congress, so we formed a Community Action Foundation. We found a young fellow
that started lobbying for various groups. We hired him. The first thing the Congress did on Reagan's request,
82

 HAL SCHULTZ
days after he was inaugurated, was shut down federal offices of community services, which was our funding in those days. Left us out there in midair. But David Bradley was already a genius, I guess, because he came up with this Block Grant. He knew that Reagan was going to Block Grant everything he could to the States. It wasn't desirable but it was survival if we could get a Block Grant. He had enough friends in Congress by then that we managed to get a Block Grant. Then our troubles with the State started. We had a traitor in the State House that did everything to destroy CAP. She'd been the best CAP director in Utah at one time, in Davis County, but she was a political animal like so many selfish people. It was hard for me to understand how people can do it. But we survived that. We had an increase in funding every year but one for the last five years when all other programs were being cut. Because we had proven the need and the communities recognized, plus the fact that we straightened up our act because we got much more businesslike, more politically astute. We've got a whale of a good lobbyist. And so CAP has survived, it's become even since I left more so, because I got things rolling
the way we needed them to roll. Locally and the county commission in Salt Lake City. I so hated that person up in the state office that I lost contact with the State of
83

 HAL SCHULTZ
Utah, it was like it wasn't even there. So Kathy, my assistant, started building bridges that had to be built some years ago. She proved herself invaluable to a number of state programs. She was in a real good position when
I left.
MT: So, funding for CAP today still comes from the federal
government?
HS: Through the State Block Grant. The Head Start money comes
direct from the Feds. Part of the law that they never could wipe out, even though they tried, said that CAP'S would be the guarantee for Head Start as long as there wasn't any mismanagement. The School Districts have tried to take it away from us, the Counties in some areas, but we still have it. That comes direct, the money from HUD for Financial Mortgage Counseling comes direct from the Feds. But the basic CAP money comes from the State Block Grant.
MT: Are there CAP programs in most of the states?
HS: There are thousands of them out there. Technically we have three in Utah. We had six, but Davis County was always a political thing, and Provo, Utah County, was always a political thing. The.program in Ogden is almost like a nothing program. That's a whole other story. They
managed to destroy Southeastern Utah and Northern Utah. And that Northern Utah CAP was a good CAP, was a great
84

 HAL SCHULTZ
advocacy group and good organizing.
MT: So there is no longer a CAP program in our southern counties?
HS: No, there is no CAP program in Southeastern Utah. There is a Head Start Program that's independent really, but the director, the Head Start director for the CAP, when it was still in existence, staked a claim with the program when the county took all of the other money away they couldn't take the Head Start money. They tried, they couldn't. So she's formed a, she took the CAP Charter and changed a couple of words in the name, and started on the program and then when Head Start money started to increase, it expanded into Sevier County, Duchesne County, Dagget County and all over the place down there. They call it the Eastern Utah Child Development Program.
MT: So, Hal, these last number of years that you'd been in CAP's and dealing with all those people from all over the country you've been flying to your meetings?
In fact, I've found a decrepit old airplane and bought it for the price of a used car, I think it's $5,200 we paid, and started fixing it. It was flyable but it looked terrible. It had antique radios in it, and so forth. So over the years I've built it into a beautiful flying machine, new upholstery, new wings, new paint job and so forth and so on. I upgraded the engine, radios and so on,
HS:
85

 HAL
SCHUL TZ
so it's a modern airplane in every sense of the word. I'd
made a deal with the Board of Trustees that I would fly to meetings that I could fly to, some I had to fly to because you don't get airline service in Warren, Wyoming. They did at one time but they don't anymore. So that was understood the places like that it was sure a lot quicker to fly then to drive. But the deal was if I went to a place that was served by an airline I wouldn't, no matter how much it would cost to get my airplane there and back I wouldn't charge CAP any more then the airline fair was. So it was a clean deal with a the board. And I did an awful lot of traveling.
So you and Lela have had some wonderful trips?
I say we have. Our last one was last September. I flew to a conference in Florida and stopped in five southern states that I hadn't been in before. And Lela went to New York on a frequent flyer freebie she had or something like that. And she and Molly went to the opera and so forth. When I got thru conferencing I flew on up to New York and picked them up and we flew up the Hudson River. It was a gloomy day but it was pleasant in lots of ways,
we really enjoyed it. Sightseeing, right up the middle of the river, just a few hundred feet off the water. You can see all of the huge fantastic mansions all along the Hudson from the old days and things like that. We flew up
MT: HS:
86

 HAL SCHULTZ
Syracuse, my favorite relative was out of town. I have other relatives there but the weather kind of had us running scared, so we had to fly according to the weather. So we stopped there but we didn't visit any relatives. We went on into Canada, Hamilton Ontario for gas and just to say we'd been to Canada. And then on over into Michigan and then flew up the middle of Michigan, cross the Mackinaw Straight to the upper Peninsula, just as the leaves had turned. And they turned every color, like Carbon County and like Utah this year. But they have a lot of different kind of trees, so it got even more kinds of color. It was just fantastic, hundreds of miles of color. And no place to land if anything happened with your engine, nothing but trees.
MT: That's the trouble with that east, isn't it?
HS: Yeah, I had faith in my Franklin engine, so we all enjoyed it. Then we went to visit Jean and Molly flew home on the airline, back to Brooklyn and we flew home. MT: Hal, you know, when we used to get together, the great
HS:
dream was to go to Australia and you did that?
we tried to go back but we got rained out. The most rains in Australian history while we were there. So
we got to see           and Sidney and a few things in the suburb, but I couldn't go to the places I wanted to go. The little airports were under water and the
87

 HAL SCHULTZ
railroad, where we stopped, it was. But I enjoyed the trip anyway.
MT: So, what year did you go down there?
HS: It was about three or four years ago.
MT: Was that one of your dreams? To go back?
HS: Yeah, got that one taken care of. I had quite an
adventure on that trip. I really hate to confess, but on the other hand I kind of get a kick out of telling that story. I made a real bad mistake. But anyway, I was finished putting in my new instrument panel and new radios, re-wired the whole airplane.
MT: You didn't fly down there?
HS: Well, we flew to Los Angeles. We were going to fly to Los
Angeles and leave the plane for Howard to play with while we were in Australia. I got it done and the only test flight I had time for, kind of reminiscing about my dad's experience, 5 minutes from Bountiful sky park back to my hanger, and everything worked. So we took off the next day and flew to Richfield. Had lunch with Lela's brother and sister-in-law. They took us out to the airport. My brother-in-law said, are you sure you have enough gas and
I said, sure, I have plenty of gas. So we took off heading for Las Vegas. I kept eyeing those fuel gauges, now airplane fuel gauges are notoriously not accurate. You can't trust them, you need to know up here how much
88

 HAL SCHULTZ
gas is in it. And I knew that both tanks were full when we left home, except for five minutes. So we're flying down the country and I said, I don't know what's wrong unless somebody got into the hanger and stole a tank full of gas, but my gauges aren't reading right at all. I said, all I can do is empty this tank, and so when the engine quits I'll just switch to the other tank and I'll know exactly where we stand on fuel. I did that quite frequently. So we're going along and the engine quits, so I flip the fuel selector over, nothing happened, zilch. The engine wouldn't run. And Lela sat up, she was pouring a cup of coffee, I guess she got a little nervous and spilled the coffee. She said, what are we going to do, what are you going to do? And I said, oh, I'm going to land. She said, where. And I said at that airport right under us. We were right smack over the airport at one of those small Utah towns. So we landed and eventually I found out what happened. When I was putting it back together that last day I had been upside down, my feet up on the seat back and my head under the panel, and I dropped a cotter pin. And apparently while I was picking up that little cotter pin, I let the handle slip and didn't realize it. So it slipped a quarter turn and I put the cotter pin in. So anyway, when the tank was empty and
I switched to the other tank, I switched it off. 89

 HAL SCHULTZ
MT: So you did have the gas?
HS: Oh yeah, I had a full tank of gas. I'd been so nervous
about the situation, I knew something was wrong but I didn't know what. I'd been watching the freeway, because that's a good place to land when there is not too much traffic. I had that spotted, but it was just fortunate that I'd seen this airport just a second or two before. It was right under us. So I just did a dead-stick landing and fooled around until I found out what the problem was, and fixed it, and away we went to Los Angeles.
MT: So, Hal, why don't you kind of update us on your family. Tell us where the kids are and where everybody is right now!
HS: Well, starting with the eldest, Jean, is practicing law in Michigan. She went to law school. She'd been a heavy equipment operator, and a legal secretary and worked on the long wall over at Plateau and she finally decided, oh yeah, she'd been a legal secretary, but she finally
/decided she wanted to be a lawyer. So she spent every dime she could beg, borrow and steal and go to law school. She graduated at the age of 45. And she is practicing law. She has her daughter Amanda with her. Her oldest daughter, Heather, and her husband, they've been married a couple of years now, they are both in the Navy in Ireland. And we have two great-grandchildren,
90

 HAL SCHULTZ
daughters - granddaughters, one born this May, the other one is about six years old. Howard is in Los Angeles, he's a specialist in finish work, working for the Kaiser Premenante Foundation. Just got engaged at the age of 42 for the first time, put a diamond on a lady's finger and I think it's a wonderful idea. And I think he'll follow thru with it, I don't think there is any question he'll make a success of it together. Cameron is in law school at the University her last year. Her second year, which is the toughest last year, she aced the whole class, she was the top student. So all the lawyers are looking at her. But she already has a job at a law firm. She'll have a full-time lawyer job with a good salary as soon as she gets thru and passes the bar next July. Molly.
MT: Now, Cameron is married, right?
HS: Yeah, she is married to Richard Kittle. He's a great big
jolly guy. Nice fellow. Really nice. They do well
together.
MT: So, where does Richard work?
HS: He works for the post office. He's also a computer whiz,
he has all kinds of computer equipment and he is writing programs and going to night .school at Westminster for computer stuff. He was a mail carrier for some years, but he wore out one of his hips and so they put him on a different kind of duty where he doesn't have to do so
91

 HAL SCHULTZ
much walking. One hip replacement, and it went easy. Cameron is all set. Molly got tired of Brooklyn, she went back to New York to make one last stab at the acting business which she loved. But she found out it was even
tougher and nastier in New York than it had been in Los Angeles and San Francisco. So she got disenchanted with acting and made a stab at big business and went to work for the Lever Brothers Soap Co. And she was rising up the corporate ladder quite rapidly, but she also got very tired of the life in Brooklyn. She got mugged once and that set her back emotionally a little bit. So when she heard about my dire illness she said I'm tired of the city, I'm going to sell out and come home. So she did that. In the meantime, she did stay with us for several months. She found that I didn't need that much help because I'm such an independent sucker anyway. I try to make it easy on everybody. She got a job in Provo with Steven Covey, she found herself in a nest of right wing Republicans and a solid wall. She was the first non- Mormon blood they had in the corporation as far as she
could find out. And they said, one of the reasons we picked you, we wanted to start changing things around. The pressure is so great, at times it's almost killing. She didn't want to commute up the freeway 40 miles, she didn't want to get into the smog situation, she has a

lung problem ever since that horse stomped on her up in Logan. So she bought a little house in Midway. She set up as a bachelor girl. And of course she's the talk of the town up there, too, because she doesn't to go church, to their church, she goes down to church in Salt Lake.
Hal, do you want to make your closing statement?
I was going to finish talking about Molly. She goes into this right wing Republican bunch down in Provo to work with where they sneered if Clinton was mentioned. And then, guess, what happened? Mr. Clinton, President Clinton, found out that program was so good that he ordered it up for all of his cabinet officials. And the political attitude began to change. The old Bill Clinton ain't so bad.
What program was this he ordered?
It's a training for people to bring humanity back into their business or their bureaucracy or whatever. There are seven steps, seven points or decree, or whatever they call it that he preaches. And there is an awful lot of that kind of training going on around the country but this seems to be highly successful. It just exploded, they have 300 employees.
So, they go all over and have workshops?
Yeah, they have presenters that go all over doing workshops. And they price it accordingly how much you can

pay. They probably stick it to the government pretty well, but if it is an organization that's strapped for money they discount it. Because they still believe in their program and from what I, I've read parts of it, it's great if people buy it. But my experience with those things is that you go for two or three days, hopefully no longer, and you get filled up with all this stuff, zeal and enthusiasm, you're so tired when you get home that you forget 90% of it. But if 10% rubs off, it's a plus. Anyway, the place where she lives, the people they've got everything straightened out. She doesn't want a husband. She had one of her neighbors come over and tell her, that's all right Ms. Cameron. It's OK if you're not married, God will find you a husband when you get to heaven.
MT: So, she has that to look forward to, right?
HS: Yeah. So, at any rate, that's the story and as far as any closing statement I don't have any gems of wisdom to leave the world. But I've always said when they give me those high honors, like they did in Washington and San
Diego.
MT: You can tell us about those high honors, I think we need
to know about that.
HS: Well, the Foundation gave me one of their highest awards
for service to the poor and then I went to San Diego and 94

other organizations, the highest award, the Lyndon B. Johnson award and that was for service to the program, helping it to survive these presidential cruxifictions that we went thru with Nixon and with Reagan. And they said so many nice things about me that it was embarrassing. But my position has always been I haven't done anything that everybody isn't supposed to do, you give what you have. I had something that the people needed, I gave. But I don't know why I should get any special honors for it.
rock-red Republican families and turned out to be wild- eyed liberal Democrats. I think Cal Black said I was a red-eyed liberal Democrat. I don't remember my eyes ever getting red, but I'd get wild-eyed a few times.
MT: Well, but bottom line you were just wonderful people. HS: Life has just been a wonderful experienceá. The coal mining thing ended and started with disaster, but it was
exciting for 20 years, challenging and exciting. Hard work, but it had it's own rewards. When things went well and you saw those... of beautiful coal coming up, one right after the other, boy, that made up for a lot of heartaches. The years in community action, I really felt rewarded almost every day because I've stayed in touch
... you and Lela lived your lives like that!
MT:
HS: Yeah, it's pretty interesting that we both came from a

and I've made that little Salt Lake agency stay humane. I've recently told one of my best friends on the national scene that I would never telephone him again. And he said, "Why?" I said because I've tried it recently and you got a phone system where they say if you want Head Start push one and if you want something else push two, voice mail. I said you have taken the humanity out of your agency, I'll never call you again. He said we had to have it: I said, no, you didn't. The last person you should get rid of if you're tight on money is that receptionist, the soothing voice and the knowledge to help people. When they call you they are desperate. And you know, it was expected in Ogden. I didn't even flinch when they... because that's the way he is. But I've seen him read people the riot act on the national scene. I gave them hell on the way out, I don't know what had happened. But the other ones got the message, don't do it.
So, anyway, it's been a great life and I can stand another four or five years if... but on the other hand I'm satisfied.
MT: Bless, you, Hal, and thank you so much! [END OF INTERVIEW]
