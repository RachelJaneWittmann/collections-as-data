 THE FOLLOWING IS AN INTERVIEW WITH JOHN W. LOWE, CONDUCTED BY MITCH HADDAD AT WALKER BANK BUILDING, SALT LAKE CITY , UTAH ON JULY 28, 1970.
MH: Mr. Lowe, the first thing I'd like to know is something about yourself.
JL: Such as what? How old?
MH: No, I don't care. A general synopsis.
JL: All right. Well, I'm a Utah native, and I'm 53; I've
been practicing law since the 1940s. I was admitted to practice in 1941; I'd just graduated from Harvard law school and at the time I was admitted I was on active duty in the army stationed at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. I got a reserve commission from the University of Utah in artillery, and I was on active duty just prior to World War II. I served about four and a half years in the army. When I cam out, have already been admitted, I just started to practice and, I've been practicing the general civil law practice in Salt Lake since that time. The firm which started out as Stevens, ---?--- and Lowe is now of course---?--- and Lowe and---?---
MH: Now, basically, could you tell me what your final contacts with uranium cases, or mining law cases have been; in what area?
JL: Well, probably my first one was involving some mining claims in the Uintah Basin of Utah. And these were mine claims of--of kind of asphaltic-sand type

 JOHN

material, and my job was to patent these claims for the owners of the claims. I started out to apply for patents and about nine years and many hearings later, patents on some of these claims were issued. That started my contact with mining claims. Insofar as uranium is concerned, I think my first contact with that was representing two individuals who were in dispute over the ownership of some mining claims in the Temple Mountain Mining District of Utah which is
in Emery County. These two individuals were claiming against other locators, other subsequent locators, and then the two individuals were also squabbling among themselves about where in the division of ownership they should prevail over the subsequent locators. We got these individuals into agreement between themselves and then were trying to obtain title to the claims for these individuals. And before it came to trial, we finally worked out and negotiated settlement, whereby we would take part of the claims, which was a certain area and quit playing our interest in the remaining area. Then the uranium boom came along, and we incorporated on company. It's called Elk Mountain Uranium; that was the brain child of a retired commander in the navy. His experience had been that of building structures for the navy at
2

 JOHN
W. LOWE # 1
various naval installations. One of his jobs had been to core drill to determine whether or not foundations were adequate, could support buildings, and he had become quite an expert in core drilling. When he read about the uranium prospecting in Utah, he figured he was a ready-made expert to come in with an old core drill and do some prospecting and drilling on claims. He wanted to organize a company, and so we organized a Utah corporation for him. We got clearance as a Regulating A company ~hrough the S.E.C, and he issued
some stock, and we take stock largely for our services. He proceeded to core drill some areas down in the southern part of the state and had some success in getting at least shows of uranium, but he never did get into production. That company subsequently merged into, I think, Central Oil and Mining, and that's where it is now, I think. It at one point had no value at all and now has some revival, not in the claims in which the old commander was interested, but in some other areas, I think largely in Mexico. Then, oh, we represented a fellow who also had a uranium company. He was an old miner in Mexico and had been intrigued with the uranium
boom in Utah, and he wanted to do some prospecting, and so we organized a company for him. And as far as
3

 JOHN W. LOWE # 1
I think, that never did have any claims that shipped any ore. That too has merged into another company, and that into another company, and I think that into another company. And I think the name of that now is Duroco (?). I just got some shares of stock sent to
me in that company; much to my surprise thinking that the whole transaction was dead, but apparently it has some new life. We also represented some owners of some mining claims again in the Temple Mountain District. Claimants to that area that was quit- claimed by the other clients was what I was talking about earlier. That litigation concerned whether or not a brother who was the executor of the deceased father's estate was entitled to keep for his own benefit those, his of the estate, the interest of the mining claims that his father had. And it was a litigation really not so much involving mining rights as involving the duties of the brother, an executor of an estate, whether or not he could have self- dealing. Our clients were awarded the ownership of the claims, and we took a proportionate interest in the claims for our fee. Then I did some buying and selling of uranium stocks myself. I think I was probably the only person who ever bought Uranium Industries, I think it was, or Uranium Inc. four
4

 JOHN W. LOWE # 1
different times and bought and sold and I lost money on each purchase---?---.
MH: I've even heard of Uranium Inc. You had quite a wide range of experience, then, dealing with uranium so that you might have seen several different aspects of it. What do you feel is legally the most vital problem in mining law. IS there any particular area which is especially weak or vague?
JL: Yes. I'd say there is one, and I referred to it earlier. The nine year it took to patent the claims, I think, is a decided weakness. The Interior Department was then and I think still is taking such a hard-nosed attitude as far as determining whether or not the claims have any value, and by having any value I mean valuable mineral that has been discovered and so on. But they administratively are making it very difficult, and have for a number of year made it very difficult, to patent a mining claim. I think that's improper; I don't think that's their function. I think they should certainly make a locator show that he has a valuable mineral, but they carry that to the extreme with a requirement of
showing that you have shippable ore, which I don¥t
think is ever, was ever contemplated by the statues. MH: Uh huh. Don't they also require that you have a
5

 JOHN W. LOWE #1
marketable product. I mean there has to be ready market for that material before they ever consider patenting it.
JL: Yes, which is one of the very objections they had in these sand deposits. They said show us that this is a valuable material. And we showed them that at the very least you can pave a street with it because the streets of Vernal are paved with it. They said, "Well, that no good." And their attitude carries over into uranium too.
MH: Now, at first you mentioned that one of your first contacts with mining law or uranium law was in regards to claiming, a claim dispute or a claim litigation. In regards to the mining law, how clear is claiming actually within the mining law? Is it fairly specific, the statue?
JL: Well, insofar as locating a claim, I think it's quite clear what has to be done. I think that the vagueness that there is, insofar as location is concerned, involves a discovery. I think that--in fact I know that a whole lot of claims are staked just on the
premise that it looks like a favorable area; and in that area, I am somewhat inclined towards the Interior Department's ,viewpoint on the patenting part of it. I think indiscriminately going out and staking
6

 JOHN W. LOWE # 1
is something that is done so often that you're winding up with just moose pasture that is of no avail. And just at what point you do have a claim that is a valid claim I think is kind of up for grabs and in the rather indefinite field. I think that's probably the vaguest field.
MH: Uh huh, well, also the conflict that arose with uranium over the nature of the land. Now claims, uranium claims can be located either as a lode or placer claim. But primarily they do this by geological structure; it is basically a placer type of claim(?) due to the action, and yet they were so vague on that. They allowed both of them, you know, to be claimed either way.
JL: Well, that poses or did pose a problem anyway on locating: Do you have a placer or do you have a lode? And if you're located in the wrong way, you were out. You have to located one, the correct one, and the other is the other, and that, that is certainly an
area of vagueness. I don't know, frankly, now what
the law is on locating uranium claims.
MH: It seems to come down to a legal conflict as to
whether or not uranium was actually metalliferous or not. And what I was wondering, has there really ever actually been a court decision as to whether it
7

 JOHN W. LOWE #1
really is or isn't? Any type of litigation case or any type of uranium case?
JL: Well, I didn't think the question was whether it was or wasn't metalliferous. I see you've run across that. I haven't. I thought the question would be more: is it placer or is it a lode; is it subject to lease or is it subject to location; and that kind of thing.
MH: Right. This brings to mind another question: the leasing of claims. Now this is an are to where come into the public land domain now. ---?--- well now, Section 589, Public Law 589, the Multiple-Use Act. But before that, the passage of these acts to, you know, make the processes more clear cut. Were there several disputes or several conflicts regarding
these?
JL: Yes, I'm sure there were, but I actually haven't been
involved with them. And they were several years ago. They were way back just prior to the passage of the act you spoke of, and I haven't had experience with them on disputes.
MH: Well, for example, this claim you mentioned with this asphalt type of material, this would come under the Multiple-Use Act. Like they say, what are you really discovering on the property? How do mining claims
8

 JOHN W. LOWE # 1
actually get around that? I mean they're fairly vague on what they actually have in their claim.
JL: Well, of course, if they don't know what they have in their claim, why, I guess they don't have a valid claim.
MH: Yeah.
JL: I think the test is, or should be--the one which at
MH:
least used to be applied was: would a reasonable person, a reasonable mining person feel that he has something of sufficient value to warrant further work to develop something of commercial value, and does he have a sufficient showing. That, of course, is a question of fact that creates a vague situation.
Uh huh. You mentioned a conflict of claims, you know, as cases that you've handled. This brings to mind a supposition which I wonder about. It seems like as far as lawlessness or the actual disregard for law and order in the Utah uranium or the mining on the Colorado Plateau there's a surprising lack of, you know, the rooting-tooting stuff you read about in the concepts of the 1849 California Gold Rush and other different types of mineral booms. Do you think the
courts of this particular area were well equipped to
handle this? Is that why so many ---?--- I was
curious as to why the lack of violence when it seem ág

 JOHN W. LOWE #1
so easy to overlap claims especially with uranium because of its questionable nature and peculiar discovery markers at certain points.
JL: Well, Lars Malachi (?) was a fellow I represented, and he is now dead, but had he lived longer he might have shot somebody else who was jumping his claim. He was one who was inclined to take things into his own hands, was very upset when there was some jumping of his claims. Why there hasn't been much, I suppose, is as you suggest, that. the courts have been able to settle the disputes well enough.
MH: Uh huh. I mean for--that's a good example. Why didn't Malachi (?) just shoot those people for trespassing his claim rather than corning to you? He knew then, that a settlement could be reached even then, even with his limited knowledge.
JL: I suppose.
MH: Uh huh. What about the tone of the courts themselves?
I mean you handled litigations for a sufficient number of years. Did the court have a bit of a condescending nature towards mining claims, or have they been fairly thorough in their knowledge of exactly what mining claims were before?
JL: Well, I think so. One of the judges in particular that comes to mind is Judge Keller who was out
10

 JOHN w. LOWE # 1
sitting in Price. I had two or three suits laid before him, and he was very knowledgeable in the mining claims and mining law, but particularly the mining claims in that area. There had been litigation after litigation before him, and he just had a lot of background knowledge concerning the general mining law and as it applied specifically in the area. I remember that at one point in one case I was arguing before him and describing the claims and stating how many there were, say, fifteen mining claims. And he said, "But that's only the first layer." And he said, "Now I know there are these locations, and these locations, and these, and the crosspatch you get--," crossword puzzle and so on. There are parts of claims and fill claims, and he had a whole lot of background knowledge on it. I think that the bar of Utah in general had quite a lot of background knowledge.
MH: Uh huh. It would seem like, then, that people would have more of a tendency to trust the opinion of the court if they knew the judges or lawyers were very well versed in what they were doing; a trust factor kind of thing going.
JL: Well, I think so, and yet some of them, some people I've represented felt that the other side has been offering bribes and so on, which I'm sure were not
11

 JOHN W. LOWE # 1
offered, and I'm sure they were never accepted either way. But you're speaking of trusting the courts, I think generally that you were right that there was a trust of the courts. There's some variations.
MH: Uh huh. I have a question too regarding roles, say, of large companies and mining, especially uranium mining. There's always pretty much the question of the small miner going out to locate it, and once he's located it, he needs the money to develop his claims. Often times it's the large company he must go to to get this money. Now hasn't there been credited a legal controversy, aside from, oh, obviously the antitrust cases, where large companies were involved?
JL: I've been involved in litigation against Union Carbide in the Temple Mountain area, but that was a matter of conflicting claims. It wasn't a question of somebody wanting to sell out or be financed by a large company.
MH: Well, conflicting claims is a large area where there's been a lot of problems too. I mean when, say, one person claims he has proper possession of a claim and another person claims that they do, the laws are set up so it would seem like it should be quite obvious who really owns the claim.
JL: W ell, i t is if you can establish the factual 12

 JOHN W. LOWE #1
situation, but it seems to me that probably for the larger areas in question there, first of al1, was valuable mineral found by the prior locators, and if so by which locators? And in the second place, if they were found, then was assessment work done and done timely each year to keep those claims alive, and
if so by whom, and was it enough, and was it the first type of assessment work? And after a number of years it becomes difficult just factually to establish it. Witnesses are not available. They have moved or died or things like that, which makes the factual proof difficult. I think the tests to be applied are clear enough. If you have a mining claim and it's a valid claim, why if you don't do your
annual assessment work during the period involved, it's then subject to relocation. And if somebody comes in and relocates, why, then he is prior. But,
maybe the work has actually been done prior locator; maybe it hasn't. And so you get into that factual problem.
MH: Uh huh. Now again, we get to the question of the assessment, when you get to things like the tax commission and the different aspects that go on.
Aren't there quite a lot of problems created by, for example, the Utah la~ regarding taxation and mining
13

 JOHN W. LOWE #1
claims. Originally, a man was assessed a hundred dollars his first year of work, then he was mandatorily required two other years of assessment-- this three year assessment thing--till eventually the tax commission changed it. Wasn't that--it seems like that was a hot legal area as far as that goes.
JL: I didn't come in contact with that. I don't know.
MH: Uh huh. ---?--- kind of have a question. This is also regarding patents. In that particular area it seemed like originally the patent law was set up to make it specifically easy for .the miner, once he had any king
of claim at all, to acquire that land as his own complete fee title, as I understand. Then what was it that really made it so hard? Was it just bureaucratic entanglements that came up or what?
JL: I think so. I think that it started with, maybe, it was Ike's Secretary of Interior who had the feeling that the public domain should be kept public domain, and felt that any issuance of patents to private individuals was encroaching upon their empire or domain. And I think there was a positive administrative policy of hanging on to all public land and making it as difficult as possible to have
anyone acquire an ownership interest in it.
MH: You mentioned before that it took you, what, almost
14

 JOHN W. LOWE #1
nine years to acquire a patent for these certain people?
Yeah.
In that time what types of procedures did you have to go through that that took nine years?
Well, there were administrative hearings. The first
JL: MH:
JL:
MH:
five were by local land office, and then by a reviewing body here, and then by a reviewing body in Washington, D.C. As I remember, there were only those three hearings, but the rulings by each of those bodies took a long time. They would sit on and not rule. And if somebody won't rule, why, there's not
much you can do.
Uh huh. Well, I have a question as to the actual expense. I mean, for the actual people who you were representing, wasn't that kind of a great expense when you come right down to it? From what I understand, the fee for filing a patent is fifteen dollars, right?
I've forgotten. That's probably right. That's probably about right. á
That's what you pay to actually file it, but then for nine years and three court transits after that, you involve a lot of money to get a patent on a claim,
JL:
MH:
don't you?
15

 JOHN W. LOWE # 1
JL: Yes, yeah, you do. Luckily, my client let me off the
hook on a fixed fee rather than quote so much per acre of patented land. They realized we were running into unexpected problems and that our fee could be raised.
MH: Uh huh. And then this is another large questionable area because really ~ntil a man can get the actual fee title to his land, his land really can be usurped at almost any time because there are no safeguard or protection of your claim.
JL: That is if you do the assessment work. But I think really that an unpatented claim is just as valid a claim as a patented one if you keep the assessment work up. Of course, you don't have any termination of certain factors that you have once you acquire a patent, such as, well, the determination that it's patentable claim. And also the determination of any adverse claimants rights. That patent proceeding does adjudicate that. But other than that, I think that
the ---?--- rights that an unpatented owner claims are just about as large as that of an unpatented owner.
MH: Well, aren't they seeking to remedy a situation, like this public land law ---?---? Haven't they just recently written a larger report in which they're
16

 JOHN W. LOWE #1
making recommendations to Congress to expedite matters? Is the Interior Department's attitude still kind of sticky?
JL:
I haven't had anything very recently, so I can't tell you. But I'll be surprised if the attitude is changed. I had hopes that after a change from Democratic to Republican administration years ago that they would change, but they didn't seem to me to change very much then.
Uh huh. Going into the question of litigation, what type of litigation is most frequent in regards to mining claims or uranium claims? What area is most frequently litigated?
Gee, I don't know. I don't know. You could list a number, such as ownership or matter of royalties or litigation of the government as to patentability, antitrust. I really, frankly don't have much of an opinion as to which is the most common.
MH:
JL:
MH: Uh huh. You said litigation on leasing was also really common. Now this is a big problem, isn't it? I mean when a man's leasing his land ---?--- royalty scheme. Isn't there often large problems which legally result out of this?
JL: Yes, largely I think in construction of what the lease terms mean. We had one case which involved a
17

 JOHN W. LOWE #1
payment of a royalty based on the net proceeds of ore. We were--now let's see-was it net proceeds of ore? I think that was the phrase, and the question was whether or not a royalty would be based on the value of ore as it was first mined, or whether it was to be based upon the value of the ore as actually sold by the miner. He had done some milling with the uranium ore and had brought it up to a higher concentrated value, and we were construing the terms of that lease. He hadn't received any proceeds until he sold it, and yet--well, see, he would be paying either upon the amount as received or the value of ore as mined. And that kind of litigation is fairly common.
MH: Uh huh. Also, too, now if a man detains another man from working his claim in anyway, then under--what is it?--federal or Utah statutes, he's subject to triple
damages almost. There's a triple detention rule?
JL: Well, yeah there's triple damage rule for--I don't think it's for the detention. I think it's based upon a trespass sort of thing that if a person knowingly removes ore from the property of another person that the rightful owner can recover triple damages. I
don't think it applied unless there's actual mining though.
18

 JOHN W. LOWE #1
MH: Uh huh. I'm curious though as to how many times this
actually has been put into effect.
JL: We tried to put it into effect on one case involving
a boundary dispute where we claimed that mining claim were laid out in the settlement of some disputes. The mining claims were quit-claimed on one side to one group, and the other side to our group, and it turned out that the surveyor who surveyed the mining claims didn't set up twofold claims in this particular instance; he was short on the 600-foot width of the claim. He had surveyed and staked at least, say, 550 feet instead of the full 600 feet as was intended. So there was that 50 foot strip dispute, and we were claiming not only title to that land but also triple damages for ore removed there from after we gave notice that this was our land, and they were on it, and get off. We weren't handling the litigation. We, at that point, were part-owners of the claims and our lawyer lost the case.
MH: So you had another lawyer do your own case for you right?
JL: Yeah. But we were--had we won, I'm sure we could have recovered triple damages for the ore removed, but the court rules that the 50 foot strip went to the other
parties. I think it's an affable statute and would 19

 JOHN W. LOWE # 1
have been applied had we won the case.
MH: That's a curious set of circumstances. Being the owner and yet being the lawyer, and you can't defend yourself in a situation like that?
JL: W ell, i t was awkward because we would have had to testify, and we did testify as to factual situations on how the settlement was arrived at, and what was the intent of the--should we get full claims or should we get full claims. And we felt that in the area of ethics, you can't testify in a case you're handling, and so we another law firm to represent us.
MH: Now this brings to mind--you mentioned quit-claims-- you know, claims people have left. I guess they're more commonly called shells. This brings to mind the shell game that they talk about today, or revitalizing old claims or old corporations into new ones, say, sometimes by large oil companies. What kind of problems can this bring about? CAn this start the whole cycle all over again or what?
JL: Well, I'm sure it can. I think, however, that there's more interest in the old mining claims, not for the mining claims themselves, but for use as a vehicle to have a public offering in securities. And therefore, those acquiring the old mining claims aren't going to be miners; they're going to be businessmen going into
20

 JOHN W. LOWE # 1
some other field.
MH: Uh huh. So using it more as a collateral type security than anything else.
JL: Well, not as a collateral, but your use of the word shell is indicative of what type of thing I'm talking about; where the one acquiring it really is acquiring it, not really for the mining claims or any other tangible or intangible assets of the company, but rather for the corporate entity and stock holdings which are public holdings.
MH: So then there's not as much action in regard to uranium litigation or... ?
JL: Well, at least I don't think that that "shell game" is doing anything to stir up any mining litigation. I think that certainly it'd stir up some S.E.C. litigation.
MH: Uh huh. Then this gets on into the question regarding the stocks, the legal problems of the penny stocks which you, as a loser, I guess could relate.
JL: I was a winner sometimes too.
MH: The period of the boom, when the uranium boom was on,
especially here in Salt Lake, was it one of--what? It
was quite forceful, wasn't it?
JL: Yes, it was certainly interesting. Down in our
broker's office we could hardly find room to read the 21

 JOHN W. LOWE #1 last quote.
MH: Was it really as crowded as they say?
JL: Oh yeah, yeah. This wasn't just in a penny brokerage
office either. This was Goodbody's or then Hogle's-- -?---. A lot of brokerage houses handled them and a lot of money was made too.
MH: And yet legally, I mean, incorporating companies, say, of this nature, were certain legal problems which each company, before it was incorporated, had to face. I mean did they have to go by a certain set of rules? It's been recorded that often time these companies didn't. Now didn't this present a big area of problems?
JL: I'm sure it did. I'm sure it did with the policing aspect of it by the Securities Commissions. There was just a whole lot of rank speculation, and yet I think that mostly the companies didn't disclose what they were doing and what they had or didn't have. It really is now and was then protection to the people handling it to disclose fully what they didn't have. People didn't care whether they had anything or not.
They were just gambling is all they were doing. They wanted to put their money in at one cent and get it out at twenty. They'd get a prospectus and they wouldn't read it. I didn't read the prospectuses of
22

 JOHN W. LOWE #1 those I bought.
MH: You mean you'd just buy, huh?
JL: I just bought. Some broker would say this is a hot
one, and sure enough it turned out to be hot.
MH: So many people were. There was a rash of speculation
just as you said.
JL: Oh absolutely. They'd have waiting lists on brokers'
desks. Put me on the list for a hundred dollars of this, not even knowing what the company was or who the officers were or anything. It's a new uranium company coming up. Sure enough you could triple your money, and just as soon as you came out. So that was really a more Las Vegas type gambling thing than it was a mining thing. It was just a vehicle to gamble in, and I think it was just more a reflection of a gambling spirit than it was any considered investment.
MH: Well, some people did lose. I mean they all didn't you know, succeed.
JL: That's true.
MH: And aren't there example of fraud cases or cases of
violation of S.E.C. rules, different kinds of things
that were brought?
JL: I'm sure there were. I wasn't involved in them. And
as I say, it's so easy to disclose in a prospectus 23

 JOHN W. LOWE #1
exactly what is going on that I think any promoters are silly to state anything other than the really more negative things. In other words, nobody's going to pay much attention to what they say anyway. At least that was true during the uranium boom, so why not paint the picture entirely black, and there's the promoter's insurance policy on any trouble with any securities regulations.
MH: Yes, it's taking a lot of trouble when you come to the question of antitrust litigation and antitrust cases involving uranium and other mineral-related companies. I mean there's cases, I mean large cases even today in the courts facing, you know, mining companies, mineral companies, oil companies. What type of problem did this whole setup really present? When you have one, you know, or several large companies buying up almost the whole commodity, considered prime resource mineral, aren't there certain legal stipulations there that were broken?
JL: Oh, I don't know. I have not much experience with that. But I don't think that just big business, per se, is bad. I know that Anaconda bought a lot of claims and had a whole lot of crude oil reserves in New Mexico, but I don't know as Anaconda got in
trouble on that.
24

 JOHN W. LOWE #1
MH:
I was thinking primarily of things like violations of Section One and Two of the Sherman Antitrust Act, or violations of Seven-A of the Clayton Act. Different violations even, for example, of Utah codes. Their sections of 50 through almost 60. I think it's 50 through 50-32 that dealt specifically with antitrust, especially Utah anti-trust regulations.
Yeah, they're parallel with federal and state.
Uh huh, and there's cases, well, this whole precedent of class action, for example, resulted out of an antitrust case in uranium mining. These are the types of problems I was wondering about. It seemed to be a big field there. It probably would have caused quite a bit of public sentiment as well as legal opinion floating around there, wouldn't it?
Ah, well you're referring to the case that Judge Ritter handled?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, that certainly stirred up a pointless
mess. Let's see, Union Carbide was the defendant in that wasn't it?
Uh huh.
JL: MH:
JL:
MH: JL:
MH:
JL: Well, those class actions are kind of lawyer-inspired
litigations where the lawyer handling it creates a fund for claimants and when, not only do the
25

 JOHN W. LOWE #1
claimants share in it, but the lawyer handling the case shares in it. It is really creating a well- financed lawsuit by handling a class action, I think. And I think that the fact that there is that kind of class action leads to more litigation than would otherwise occur. If class actions weren't allowed, each individual claimant wouldn't think it worthwhile to go ahead and litigate.
But also, wasn't the precedent for that established so that you have to hqve a violation obviously there? A decision has to be handed down and damages have to be awarded before the class action can even begin collecting?
Well, yeah, liabilities are determine first, and all those similarly situated can come in and claim a share of whatever damages they can prove really.
From what I understand, then, you can advertise in the paper for a certain length of that, if this happened to you, you are eligible for availance-- Yeah, I think they do. I suppose by court order. I
MH:
JL:
MH:
JL:
MH:
don't know.
You'd have to have a court order to do something like that, wouldn't you?
JL: I don't know. I've never handled one.
MH: Now let's kind of move into the present day, and this

is kind of a sticky question, but moving to the subject of mining, ecology, and the environment, and quote, unquote: "You know what mining really does to the environment." Especially for uranium and different things like this, isn't this an area which the power that ecology seem to have pushing for it could really change a lot of laws in regards to mining law?
JL: Yeah. I'm sure it will have a big effect on it; however, the problem Kennecott has here--Jack O'Keef has been before lots of boards and civic clubs and all kinds of bodies explaining how Kennecott is really causing less pollution, even though it's more visible now than it had been before.
MH: How's it causing less pollution? I'm curious to that one.
JL: Well, he says that the filtering processes that they are presently using filters out a lot of sulphur dioxide, but in doing so, it creates kind of an aerosol formation so that you have kind of a haze--
MH: A reddish haze--
JL: --that's more visible even though having less sulphur
dioxide than before. And that was his explanation to Rotary. So that you look out there and see the plume of smoke coming up--it's not too visible right now,

but there is some and you can see it much more plainly than you could ten years ago. There is more pollution even though there is less contamination. But I'm sure that there is going to be more vigorous advocacy of the rights of the public to have nature
remain as it is and have less development of natural
resources. I think there's a decided conflict here. MH: And this again ties in which what you said bout the Interior Department. With this developing the Interior Department will again adopt a hard-nosed
stand even more so probably than they ever have.
JL: I'm sure that the Sierra Club and the Audobon Societies, and so forth, will be very much in favor of the Interior Department not patenting mining claims, and so they would be lobbying in favor of
that kind of action on the part of the Interior.
MH: So then ultimately, according to mining laws, really that's wrong. I mean mining laws cleanly set forth to aid the miner, right? The Department of Interior--do
they have complete ultimate legal power?
JL: They do if they don't abuse their discretion. If their in factual findings are supported by the evidence, then if in applying those facts to the law,
they don't abuse discretion, why, the courts won't touch them at all.

MH:
I'm wondering, I mean ultimately they do achieve their power from the constitution itself, which states that the public land or the public land domain shall be ruled by the federal government in the way it sees fit.
Correcting that--
Correcting that. So ultimately if the government wanted to, they could completely take away all the mining claims. Maybe .they seem to have almost done that today.
I think if you have a very strong case, then the government apart from the Interior would have to go ahead and patent them. If they didn't, I think you could legally force them to do it because you could then establish an abuse of discretion in applying the laws.
Then this brings in a very big conflict. The government has the power to grant patents and yet the Atomic Energy Commission, especially during the uranium boom and even after, had a very, very active part in the buying of uranium itself.
Yes, but at the same time the government was leasing
the domain instead of encouraging patents. They were saying, "You may get a lease on it, and you can develop the minerals, but you don't own that as a

mining claim."
Uh huh. So then it was basically a lease question rather than a fee title question?
Yeah. Right.
In practice did they use the idea of owning your own claim or seeking to have a patent upon your own claim?
I don't think that there are many people applying for patents right now. At least to my knowledge, I haven't run across them.
Uh huh. That's a curious point because, you know, it would seem like ownership is so important to a mining claim, especially legally. I mean there's so many fewer problems when the person owns the land.
There used to be a very cogent reason not to patent land claims because they were not taxed as property tax. But the states now taxes both patented and unpatented, I think, so the tendency not to patent should no longer be present.
---?--- Do you mean m~ny people didn't seek a patent
MH:
because they would be taxed?
JL: Because they would get on the state tax roll if they
did.
MH: Hmm. An interesting point. So again let's go back to
the largest areas of mining law. You stated that 30

 JOHN W. LOWE #1
patents are definitely one. I guess I really do have a question as to maybe ownership roles, the second largest area of discrepancy. You know the large

flagrancies ---?--- exactly who, how, and what you can do with your land.
Yes.
Is there any action, you know, in the foreseeable future that they can mitigate these or what?
I'm not aware of any.
Uh huh. There's no system or practice that's actually corning up to try to rectify this?
I don't know of any.
I guess I just have a final question then. The mining laws have been in existence, basically--the basic federal mining law was passed in 1870 and so it's been in existence for quite a while to say the least. Was it 1870 or 1872? Anyway...
It was 1872, right. Because one section of it was passed in 1866 dealing with one type of mining, another in 1870, and the final compilation in 1872. And it's been in effect for, you know, almost a hundred years now. And have there been very many shifts as the technology of the world or as the need for mineral resources has become more and more
demanding? A ctually ,
I guess w ith an expanding
31

 JOHN W. LOWE # 1
society it's pretty logical that the needs become more great. Have the laws actually changed at all to meet that need or are they still basically the same?
JL: Well, except for the Multiple-Use Act and so on, the change of the original mining laws are pretty much in effect. I guess you come down, though, to a question of philosophy. Should individuals or companies own natural resources? I think they should. If the government should control all natural resources and retain ownership of them, why, then I guess the government should repeal the mining laws and go on a leasing basis with a royalty of the government. I
would be in favor of continuing and expanding the old
mining laws.
MH: Uh huh. When you say expanding, how do you feel
expanding would be needed?
JL: Changing the attitude of the Interior Department.
MH: I see, and continue--
JL: I don't know. Maybe I'm not up to date. Maybe they
are more liberal now. I haven't handled anything
before them for some time.
MH: Uh huh. I'm kind of getting a picture of this whole
procedure. You go before the Interior Department like you're signing your own death warrant. I mean they just mumble and jumble you so bad with red tape and
32

 JOHN W. LOWE # 1
administrative hearings
different other things that they make it almost financially and time-wise really impossible to obtain a patent no matter how valid a claim you have.
JL: And they--you mentioned the ecology part of it. They have understandably been reticent to issue patents to mining claimants who have beautiful cabin sites and are really after the cabin site and development, and that, of course, would subject to desecrating the
forests and so on. And I--I am a nature lover too, but I think that the pendulum has gone too far in the Interior Department towards frowning upon all mining claims just to protect it from some abuses that certainly are possibly present.
MH: So then basically, the areas for claiming a mine itself, the areas for putting up your discovery markers and how to actually assess or work a mine are
fairly clear. It's only when you get a fairly successful mine and you want to do something with that mine that problems really begin legally.
JL: Or, if you want to patent a mine before you actually are shipping ore, then you've got problems.
MH: Is there anything you care to add in regard to mining law or the subject---?---.
JL: Ah no. I enjoyed talking to you. I think you know 33
and committee hearings and

 JOHN W. LOWE # 1
more mining law and history than a whole lot of lawyers.
MH: Thank you.
