WINFORD BUNCE IN IS A PART OF THE
URANIUM ORAL HI S TO RY PROJECT CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY UTAH AND CALIFORNIA STAT E COL LEGE AT F ULLERTON .
OF
SG: Mr. Bunce, can you tell me when you first came to Moab? WB: Fourth day of December, 1931.
SG: And what kind of town was Moab at that time?
WB: At that time, oh, I would guess the population was maybe
a thousand. No pavement, the streets were all dirt--big ditch running down th ro ugh the center of the street, great big trees. It was just a little country town.
SG: What brought you to town?
WB: I brought a herd of cows here to feed them for the
SG: WB: SG: WB:
winter.
So you were a rancher at the time?
Uh huh.
And did you remain in ranching?
Uh, my folks stayed here, and they was here for several years, and they stayed in the ranching business. I didn't. Let's see, I was eighteen at the time, and I broke off and got to work and finally got married, and then I never did go back to it.
SG: What kind of jobs have you held?
WB: You name it, I've been there!
SG: Have you done any mining yourself?
WB: No, I haven't, no--well, one time we did have a claim
leased that we leased that we mined a little bit, but that's all. I never staked any claims, I never mined any.

 WINFORD BUNCE 111
During the uranium boom itself, I was in the lumberyard business and muck drilling business. So I did see a lot of claim stakes, and sold a lot of claim stakes and geiger counters and this kind of stuff, but I never actually staked a claim myself. I was staked in on a few claims, but that's all.
Were you involved in this business before the uranium boom came?
Lumberyard?
Lumberyard.
I purchased the lumberyard in January, 1951. And the uranium boom, itself actually didn't get going 'till '53. And I think the big kickoff was in August, I think, of
JD:
WB: JD: WB:
SG:
WB:
'52 when Charlie Stein hit our here and said, "Eureka! Moab's the place!" So, I was actually in the lumberyard business prior to the uranium boom, all right.
Do you remember about what kind of increase your business had? Once the uranium boom had began? About what were your sales before and--?
I sold out before the real big increase in lumberyard business came on. I sold out in '54, so I had '53 and '54, along with part of '52 during the boom time, but actual housing hadn't started to develop. So the big thing that I sold was stuff to the people in the mining business, like Charlie Stephens. A lot of mine stakes and
2

 WINFORD BUNCE /11
props and shovels, and this kind of stuff. And it made quite an increase in the business, all right. I don't remember how much, but it was quite an increase. It
finally really got good, though when they got to building
houses, a lot of them.
JD: Well, what did you go into after selling the lumberyard?
WB: JD: WB:
JD:
WB:
SG: WB: JD: WB:
SG: WB:
I built the Prospector Lodge.
Oh.
And we run that. I had a partner during this time. We built the Prospector Lodge and run it for two or three years in there and then sold out.
So, you're right, you have gone into quite a few different things.
Oh, yes. Then I fooled around after that a while, and then I finally opened up a grocery store. And I sold it out, oh, about in '63, I guess.
So now, you're just working for the city, or--
I spend all my time for the city.
You don't have any other business activities outside?
Oh, I'm clerk for the draft board, but then that all fits in together.
Right. You don't get paid for that anyway.
Not much, no.
JD: Let's see, when did you first become involved in city politics?
3

 WI NFORD BUNCE 111
WB: We11, I never was rea11y invo1ved too much in citY
politics until 1965. Of course, I've always been in politics more or less. I actually got into politics before I was old enough to vote. In 1938, I was elected county treasurer, and I put in, oh, four and a half, five years at that. Then I went into the state legislature for two terms, came out of there, and then I put in ten or twelve years as county commissioner. But I stayed away from city politics pretty much all this time 'cause city politics are dynamite, I guess you know. So I stayed away pretty much from city politics all those years, oh I was city treasurer for years and years in there when actually about all I had to do was balance the books once a month and sign a check. And I think we got five dollars a month or something for doing it, but somebody had to do it. But, actually, as far as being in city politics, I wasn't
'till '65.
SG: Were you county commissioner during the time the uranium
boom was going on? WB: Yeah.
SG: Well, from your view, what were the central problems that the boom caused for the county?
WB: The biggest problem we had in the county with the uranium boom was all these house trailers just moving out under every tree, and this kind of stuff. 'Course, it put a
4

 WINFORD BUNCE 111
real strain on the road program. Actually, we'd just got started on a road paving project. Up until that time, the county hadn't done any road paving, and a lot of these roads that used to have maybe ten cars a day on them developed in to carrying maybe hundreds a day. So we had
to immediately go right into quite a paving program, especially all around Moab. And between the roads, these trailer houses, the sanitation problems, and some of this stuff, these were probably our biggest problems. And then immediately we grew out of our hospital, so we had to build a new hospital.
SG: So everything came at once?
WB: We built this new hospital down here in--what? In '55
and '56. We opened it in '57. But the city's the one that really had the problems worse than the county. Number one, the county has a lot more of a tax base for money than the city does so you can get more money to do something with ¥ The city was caught here with t we1ve hundred people and really no big taxable base. I doubt there was a million dollars worth of valuation in the town at that time. So the water lines were not big enough. The sewer lines were not big enough. They hadn't enough water to even start to watering the people. And they really had some problems. Theirs was a lot tougher
than the county's, actually. 5

 WINFORD BUNCE #1
SG: All these problems were city responsibility, not the
county? WB: Yes.
SG: In Utah, in terms of responsibility, what is the division between the city and county?
WB: Well, actually, the county has no responsibility inside the city limits.
SG: None whatsoever?
WB: No. Of course, we always helped the city out in all their
road work, and all this kind of stuff. We had every street in town paved. I think Moab was the first town in the state of Utah that had every street paved 'cause the county done it.'
JD: Was this done during the time of the uranium boom?
WB: No, this was before. Actually, this was done, oh, '38 and '39. So the streets were all paved. This did solve that kind of a problem all right. 'Course, they were still using some of them that we paved at that time. But, we always helped them out. The county sti11 helps the city on their street-working stuff, but they actually have no
responsibility outside of that.
JD: You mentioned that road problems were a problem for the
county itself. Did you get any special funding for this,
or did you have to use your regular tax resource base?
WB: We done a lot of dealing with the A.E.C. and we done a
6

 WINFORD BUNCE 111
lot of good road work with them. They'd get a mine somewhere, somebody would, so we'd deal with the A.E.C. trying to build his road. And they would build it more or less kind of where we wanted it to do the most good, and maybe make a little better road out of it. And they built us a lot of roads that way.
SG: Did they pick up the total tab for this, or--?
WB: Most of them, they did; some of them, they didn't. Now, the new road out to Dead Horse Point, I think we put up 40 percent of the money on that, or something like that.
And the new road up Castle Valley, the built the road, but there's a bad hill up there, and we had to cut the hill down. If we cut the hill down, they'd build the rest of the road. So we went up and cut the hill off, and then they built the road. But, outside of that, they built the roads, and put gravel to them, and the county would oil them.
SG: So this was pretty good size help, then?
WB: Oh, it was a real lifesaver, you might say, 'cause it got
road to places that we needed the roads to start with. And we just never could have built them, that's all. See this road down the other side of the river? A.E.C. totally built that road. They just built the road and put gravel on it, and then the county went in and paved and stuff. They built all of that road to town. We couldn't
7

  WINFORD BUNCE 111
have touched it. And they built a new road to Polar Mesa,
SG:
WB:
SG:
WB :
even, and we didn't have a dime in that. The new road up to Castle Valley, I think, they put a hundred thousand dollars in this state road up the river. And then they built the roads off into the Colorado River, like Shaeffer Trail, Horse Thief Canyon, and the new road into Yellow Calf. They was really a big help on this business. We needed the roads, all right, but without them, we'd never have got 'em built.
Do you have any idea how much money they spent on all these roads roughly?
I wouldn't hardly venture a guess. I would imagine it must have been two or three million dollars, though. But they had to have the roads to get the ore out, and we needed the roads, too, so we made an awful good deal. But it was a lot of money.
Yeah. You mentioned that the other problem was one of housing. Did the county have any kind of regulation on these trailers, or did this come after the boom?
N e i t h e r t h e c o u n t y n o r t h e c i t y h a d a n y z o n i n g regulations. 1954 was when the first zoning ordinances were ever passed by the city and the county.
SG: And was this passed by the city.
WB: The city had passed theirs, and the county passed theirs. JD: At the same time?
8

 WINFORD BUNCE /11
WB: Uh huh¥ But the county just owns this va11ey and
everything that's in the valley. Outside of the valley, there was no zoning. And there still isn't. But in the valley, this was done in '54. So you had really no control to say, "this is what you do, and this is what you don't do." Then, the people who have seen the things that have happened over the years that shouldn't have happened say, "Well, why did they do this?" Well, the things of it was, nobody really realized what they were getting into. I see it now. Some of it I couldn't see then, but it would have been different. If it was to happen today, it don't happen the way it did 'cause the people are up on it. They would approve a subdivision that probably today you couldn't have got approved easy. They ' d say , "We11 , thi s engineering is not just exact1y right, you got to re-lay this out." But we needed the housing so bad. And they say, "Well, the engineer done it. It's all right." And things did happen. Same thing with the county. We didn't really quite know what everything was. But, of course these things--we didn't
really get the brunt of them. The city did.
SG: Uh huh. So now with a little bit of hindsight, you look
back on everything.
WB: Oh, yeah. I see things now that grew up that shouldn't
have done. You have that Bureau of Land Management all in 9

 WINFORD BUNCE /11
that upper part of the valley here. They created two-and- a-half acre tracts of ground and sold 'em. They provided no streets, they provided no nothing! People went up there and bought 'em. It isn't the county's responsibility to build roads in a subdivision. It's a federal subdivision. Who's going to build the roads? We was all for it at the time. It looked like a real good deal to get those lots divided up and let people buy a piece of ground and get settled. But then when we'd got through with the thing, after it got so far, we finally said, "Look, fellows, this is the end. Shut her off! It's killing us!" We had to stop it.
SG: It was costing you more money than you were getting out of it?
WB:
Well, you--you wouldn't get enough out of it in ten years to build one-tenth of the roads. The tax base just wasn't there to raise enough money to build 'em. And where the county gets a lot of their money, and so does the city, is through our---?--- road fund. Well, this is based on the mileage that's already a road! You don't get any money to go and build this road. You build it out of the funds you get, and then next year you can add it to the system and get some additional funds from it. So, ---?--- this stuff out of funds that the county had which was-- well, they haven't even got the road started to be built
10

 WINFORD BUNCE 111 out here yet.
SG: Was the fact that so many of the mines were in San Juan County, and not in Grand County, cause an added problem along with the fact that some people were living here?
WB: Well, this always creates a problem, especially with schools. It really didn't create a problem with the city 'cause the mines weren't around the city anyway. The people lived in the city. They built homes, the evaluation went up, and the stores did a bigger business. In the county, it didn't hurt us quite so bad 'cause the mines were out there, and we didn't have to build roads
to the mines. But the schools that got all of the kids, they didn't have the tax base to raise the taxes for the schools, you see. They're the ones that got hurt by the people living here and the mines being in San Juan--more so than anybody.
SG: So, the county really got more of the benefits than disadvantages from the thing?
WB: Yeah, I think the county has benefited in the long run more than the city has. But the schools--it hurts the schools. See, up to that time, Grand County, per capita students, was the big, bad rich example in the state of Utah. We had all the money for all the kids and everything. Now, it's reversed. There is school equalization now, and that's the only thing that saves
11

 WINFORD BUNCE 111
'em. But, you see, the people themselves, the residential
property does not pay their own way on the tax base. It takes industry and business. So the school got clobbered on that end. But it didn't kill the county too bad, or the city, either one.
SG: Did the county have to add any extra personnel or create any new jobs with the boom?
WB: Well, we had to build up the road crew quite a bit. And, of course, when we got the new hospital, why, we had to create quite a bunch more jobs there. But in the county itself, the only office--let's see, they put on another couple of sheriffs, deputy sheriffs. We'd always worked with one, just the sheriff, you see, and a part-time deputy or something. But we finally wound up with, at one time, I think we had three deputies. And in the city and county offices, like the recorder's office, they got flooded with all these claim notices and all that stuff. I had to put on a permanent helper in there. And the assessor's office had to put on some extra help at times,
but the others got along pretty much as they had all the
time.
SG: Did any new positions themselves have to be created?
WB: No, we didn't actually create any new pay positions. Of
course, with the planning, we had to create a planning commission and this kind of stuff, but these were non-
12

 WINFORD BUNCE 111
paying goodwill jobs.
SG: How much authnr i ty does the planning commission have? Are they just advisory, or--?
WB: Actually, the planning commission, they really d0n't have a great deal of authority. They're a guide. The planning committee helps get all these guide ordinances set up, and then it's up to the county to enforce these ordinances. And normally, when effective planning is done this is hashed out by the planning commission and the county commission, or the planning commission and the city council. But to actually go ahead and do something, anyone of the planning commissions on their own can do it. Now, if they want to change the ordinance, or if they think anything's wrong and they want to change it, they can't do any of this. All they can do is recommend to the council or the commission. And then, they go ahead and advertise, and it's done.
SG: Did the county have any problems with sanitation or with health? I know the city had some problems this way.
WB: Well, the county never did get into a sewer system or a water system. They did have septic tanks and this kind of stuff, and at times it got a little out of hand. Somebody had to be on that fellow and see that it's done. This fellow's the building inspector and kind of follows that thing, you know. But they didn't actually have a big
13

 WINFORD BUNCE 111
problem. It wasn't congested enough to really cause this big of a problem. You might have a trailer here, and one over here, and one over here. We had a few trailer courts out in the county, but when they were set up, well, they all put in septic tanks, anyway, see. So, we didn't
actually have too bad a problem on sanitation.
SG: Do you remember about how much the county expenditures
went up over this period? Any kind of a rough estimate? WB: Oh, the county budget was probably in 1950--I'd say it was probably less than a hundred thousand dollars. And it went up to--probably in the next four years, it went up
to three hundred thousand--or close to it.
SG: So it about tripled.
WB: Yes.
SG: Were these expenses pretty much evenly divided--the
increased expenses over the different areas of the budget? Or was most of this money being funneled into one or two special areas?
WB: Well, your biggest increase probably came for your roads and the hospital. The new hospital went in. Well, even the old one, the expenses went up a lot 'cause they were so overloaded that we just had to hire a lot of people to
run it. The actual offices themselves--the biggest increase was probably in the increases in salary to officials. See, they probably went from, say, a $150 or
14

 WINFORD BUNCE 111
so a month to maybe $400, right quick. See, t his was all governed by statute and was set on valuation. If your valuation was five million, this was all you could pay; ten million, then this is what you pay. Well, Grand County went from about five million to about twelve million in about two or three years. So the wages were
climbing pretty fast.
SG: Did the county have to issue any bonds or anything like
this to cover their expenses?
WB: No. Let's see, we bonded $250,000 for the hospital. It
was a $750,000 hospital. But the public subscriptions-- these miners, a lot of them, put in money, see. Charlie Stein gave us $50,000 on it, and then 50 percent was a Hill-Burton grant. But the hospital itself cost about $750,000, but we only bonded for the $250,000 and the mines put up the rest of the money. And let's see, I don't think we had another bond issue. We didn't have another bond issue, I guess, until the county made this addition to this courthouse.
SG: That's pretty good.
WB: Well, we built this swimming pool down here that the city
owns. Actually, the county built it. We built the swimming pool and paid for it out of the revenues that we had. We didn't bond or anything for it. It cost us about
$75,000. But your extra fees that you have from the 15

 WINFORD BUNCE //1
recorder's office and the increase in taxes that we had gathered, the levy kept going down, but the valuation went up fast enough so we were still getting more money. So we did build that thing just out of current revenues.
SG: Do you know if the city at this time had to release any bonds to cover some of their expenses?
WB: Not current expenses they didn't, they bonded for water and sewer. Fact is, I think the last bond issue they had was for $1.25 million. But the city, to meet their quick expenses, went into this 1 percent gross license on all sales.
SG: And this was able to cover most of their--?
WB: This is what saved 'em. Then they went into parking meters, which, of course, when the parking meters were
paid for, why, they didn't make 'em a dime. I don't know that it ever got to be too much of a revenue deal. But the parking was terrible. See, the road didn't go straight out at all like it does now. It went to the First Security Bank, and then up this street, Center there. And the parking was so congested down in the couple of blocks in town that you just couldn't drive. People would pull up there and parked and stayed all day. They'd say, "I gotta go here and here and here," so they'd just leave their cars. If they moved, they couldn't get another parking place. And the post office
16

 WINFORD BUNCE 1/1
was in there. A man would probably be in there parked and
---?--- parked a couple of rows behind him. And they fin ally had t o put in parking meter s t o try and control it.
SG: Well, I know the parking meters aren't there now, so when did they take them down?
WB: They were taken out, I don't know, somewhere in the early sixties.
SG: So they're out for over five years now?
WB: Well, yes. They were a nuisance, though.
SG: Well, in terms of your present job, how much power does
the mayor have in the city government? Is it more of an honorary thing within the council, or is it--? No, no, the mayor's authority runs more toward administration than anything. When it comes to approval, the mayor has to get approval from the council to do practically anything, you know. They control the money, in other words. Of course, we buy all the everyday stuff we want to buy and need to run on. But when it comes to buying machinery, or an investment in anything, it has to go by the approval of the council. But the everyday operation, this is pretty much the mayor's responsibility.
SG: Do the voters vote for the mayor directly, or does the council--?
WB: Yes, it's elective now. Four year s. 17

 WINFORD BUNCE 111
SG: Because in some states, you know, the council votes for
the mayor, and the mayor's just another councilman.
WB: Yeah, yeah, they have this generally where they have city manager-type government. And they have this big board of
council, and they elect one of these guys mayor.
SG: Right, so this city doesn't use the city manager, then? WB: Most third class cities have an elected mayor and an
elected council and some of them do have city managers, but they're appointed. Some of them change their type of government, and some just get along.
SG: Right now, what are the chief problems for the city itself?
WB: The biggest thing we're faced with now is getting back from this road situation. This is always one of the biggest problems. That's what all these papers are that I've got piled up here. Right there are the intentions to created better---?--- and paving districts. We're going to curb and pave every street in the whole town. And
we're going into the special improvement district, which will pay it back over a ten year period. This will get us out of some of these street problems that we have. You've noticed. You've been around town. You can't control the dirt; you can't control the leaves; it's a mess. And then you have floods, and you can't control them. So when we get this in, this'll help us a lot on
18

 WINF C1 RD BUNCE 111
the street problem. Of course, we have your everyday cat and dog problems.
Do you have any problem with recruitment of workers for the city?
No, we have been very lucky about this. Most of the men we have, have been with us, some of them, as much as ten years. The police department's the only one we really had a problem with. We got that settled down now. They have been with us a year or so, and are pretty settled down
SG:
WB:
SG: WB:
SG:
and going to stay. The police did turn over. Every morning when he'd cnme to work, he'd be looking for a new one for a while.
What was the primary reason for this changeover?
Oh, various things, some of it salary. They could get more somewhere else, some of 'em decided that they didn't like police work, they didn't get along with the chief, all this kind of stuff. You never know what all of it is. Uh huh. What is the city view on all of the tourism that's coming in here? Would you like to see more of this, or do you hope to still get some more mining type work?
WB: Well, if you had a choice, you'd take both.
SG: Well, yeah.
WB: I think we need more industry. Tourism is too seasonal in
a place like Moab. We've got to have something that's 19

 WINFORD BUNCE 111
stable year-round. The tourist business is real good, and it's growing, and I don't think they can stop it if they wanted to I think it's really good business, but it's only June, July, and August. Then in the fall, we have the more or less retired tourist that comes and stays for a week or two at a time. It holds up pretty good through September, October, and November. But then the rest of the time, you don't have any tourist business. So you've got to have a stable industry somewhere to keep the town operating. The tourist business is just extra.
SG: So you need a wider tax-base. What kind of things is the city doing right now to try to get more business to come into the area?
WB: We11, we created here, just this year, an Economic Development Committee, and the county appropriated $20,000 for it. We hired a director to work strictly on trying to locate new businesses. The general problems that we have is this flood problem that we have up here around the hills, and he's doing a lot of work on this
kind of stuff. With the Bureau of Engineers and Soil Conservation Service. We're trying to create a dam up here in Mill Creek. He's doing a lot of work on this with the Bureau of Reclamation and these other agencies. So, he has varied jobs that run from recruiting business to taking care of the business we got, to flood control,
20

 WINFORD BUNCE #1
reclamation, tourism, the whole bit. This was just created this year, and we hope for great things to happen with it. This is something that takes ti me .
SG: Are there any special types of industries that you're trying to get, or--?
WB: Actually, now, we're looking for a small--well, twenty- five to a hundred or two hundred people operation. Maybe a woman's sewing industry, or something like this, would fit in. For big industry, you've got to have natural resources on the location. You see, you couldn't put a steel mill down here 'cause you'd have to import all your iron, all your coal, and everything else. But that's how come we got potash, because the potash is here. We've got uranium mills and stuff because the uranium was here. So, your big industry you get because your natural resources is here to develop it. You've got to look out for the small businesses that people here need. Other jobs can fill in--electronics plant, or something, you know. The freight ---?--- situation that you can haul it in and
haul it out.
SG: Is the isolation of Moab any problem in trying to get
industry into the area? The fact that--
WB: I think it is. I think it is. I really can't say for
sure, anymore than what the Employment Security Office in Salt Lake has told me. The reason they haven't been down
21

 WI NFORD BUNCE 111
here with these the smaller, middle size factories is that through the central part of the state, they could put one in each town. MAybe they'd only hire fifty people here, and fifty here, and fifty here, but they could hire them and one truck could service all of them. Whereas, one of them just on it's own couldn't stand. If they were close enough together they could. One company could
service all of three of them. And we're so far from anybody that this would create a problem. See, Monticello and Green River are our closest towns, and they're better than fifty miles away.
SG: Right, well, what kind of growth do you think Moab is going to have over the next five years, say?
WB: Oh, I think we're going to have some growth. I don't look for any big spectacular growth unless something happens. Unless uranium breaks loose again, or they put in some
more potash mills, or we get some other industry in here, I don't look for any great, great boom again. But I do think we're going to keep growing. In fact, people are still building houses. I don't look for any settling down, or going back, or anything, but I also don't look for any big wild growth either .
SG: Do you think there is any future for Moab as a retirement community? I know this has been mentioned by a few other people.
22

 WINFORD BUNCE 111
WB: I don't know. Persnnally, I think it would be a gond
place for retirement. I don't think there's any question about this. But what makes people retire? And why do they go where they go? Now we have a few people here that have come in here and have retired all right. The first people that we had were from New Jersey. One guy come here and he liked it, so he said, "I'm going to stay." So then three, four, or five of his friends, they decided to come. Now if you can get a few located, and they bring their friends with them, you're all right. But if you can't get them to bring their friends with them, it's not going to do any good. We had a couple that I know of move in here this summer and buy property. In fact, there are two of them here right now building houses and being just flat retired. And I know two others that have bought
property, and, "As soon as I retire, I'm coming in." Now if these people get here and start telling their friends this is a nice place, they will bring somebody. But to actually go our and advertise and build a lot of retirement homes, and then they don't come, then I'm afraid we're batting a little rough go. I think it's a collecting system; with one brings the rest of them.
JD: When you came here in 1931, what were the major industries that you were acquainted with?
WB: It was strictly agriculture. 23

 WINFORD BUNCE 111
JD: Strictly agriculture? Farming? Was it mostly peaches and
apples that were there?
WB: Even at that time, they had the fruit growing industry.
They were raising quite a lot of strawberries, alfalfa, and corn for livestock, and this was about the main industry. Then in the thirties, this is when this peach deal came in. Everybody started planting peaches and apples and so forth, and that's when we created the fruit growing industry.
JD: This would probably utilize almost all of the agricultural potential in the area, wouldn't it? The acreage that was available for agriculture was utilized?
WB: At that time , everything that cou1d be farmed , was farmed. The fact is, there are places now where they just quit farming. But at that time, there was a lot of agriculture in Grand County, but it's just fallen off.á
JD: How about cattle raising? How many people had cattle? Was it a pretty good percentage?
WB: Yeah. The percentcJge itself--well, everybody had a few, let's say. But the big ones, there were several. There were a few big outfits that were strictly in livestock business, sheep or cattle. Of course, now we don't have a sheepman in the county. The cattle is off, I would say, but 50 to 75 percent, at lease, or maybe more. So the
livestock business has fallen off. 24

 WINFORD BUNCE #1
JD: Well, were there a lot of sheep herds here, or were they
WB:
JD:
WB:
here just for wintering?
No, there were actually people here that owned sheep at that time. There were several of them that were actually in the sheep business that lived here. Now it's strictly a winter range deal.
Was most of the mining operation done by individuals or were there any companies here?
In those days, uranium and vanadium was something that they didn't even talk about. It was a gopher-hole affair. No companies. A few individuals would go out and dig out a little ore and sell it. Now, Mr. Balsley was in the business of buying high-grade uranium, and a few people would go out and dig out just exactly that--the high grade. And he would buy this, and I think he would ship it to Pittsburgh, if I remember it.
Right.
But he bought it and put it up in--oh, I don't knnw, fifty or a hundred pound bags, and that was it. We never had any organized mining, uranium as such, until in 1952. So were there many people that you would kind of refer to as Saturday or Sunday afternoon prospectors, who just prospected to earn a little bit of extra money?
Oh, there was quite a few people that actually worked at
this quite a lot. I don't know, maybe twenty-five, 25
JD: WB:
JD:
WB:

 WINFORD BUNCE 111
thirty, forty, fifty of them.
JD: In the town? WB: Yeah.
JD: For a town of eight hundred or nine hundred that would be quite large.
WB: Yeah, but there was quite a lot of them that just worked at this mining and getting this high-grade uranium, and there was really nothing done during the war time. During the war time. During the war, many people really got into the vanadium business, and there really wasn't any big companies in here, even then. They hauled the vanadium to Ervan (?) and Grand Junction and so on. But everybody that had been in this pretty much fooling around all these years, they got int0. this vanadium then. And then after the war, it died again. And nothing really happened in uranium until '52.
JD: Well, talking about back in the thirties, when we talked about the local people being involved in it, did the county or the state have roads or access roads that would permit them to drive any equipment in, or were they
having to go up by walk-in type situation?
WB: Oh, they got themselves in there. If there wasn't a road, they built it. Actually, most of it would either be small
compressors, or it was a shovel operation. JD: It's a shallow dig?
26

 WINFORD BUNCE #1
WB: Yeah. W ell, now in the Morrison Formation, they c ould dig
in and find trees. And they'd just take out a whole tree. One whole tree really paid them off well, so they got a good grubstake to go find another tree. And it was a pick
and shovel.
JD: Were the people at that time getting paid enough by
WB:
finding this high-grade that it would outdo the people who were going for wages? I mean, could they make a good moderate living out of it?
It's out of the question. That's one reason that I never got interested in the uranium business because I had worked in grocery stores and dry goods stores here over all of these years, and I'd see these guys buy a herd of groceries, and you'd never get your money out of it. They just couldn't make enough to live and work at it.
Did you ever get the urge to grubstake someone, to give somebody some money to go out and prospect a claim?
I have lnaned out geiger counters and this kind of stuff, and I got staked in on some claims, but I never did stake
JD:
WB:
one.
JD: When you talk abnut getting staked in on some claims, did
people go out and stake for you, or how did that come
about?
WB: Oh, they'd say, "Well, you put up the geiger counters and
some stakes, and we'll put you in on the claims, two or 27

 WINFORD BUNCE 111
three of them, you know. Something like this. That was
JD: WB: SG:
WB:
JD:
WB:
about it.
Did it ever pan out?
No, never turned a nickel on it.
Did you get involved at all in any of the penny stocks that became available?
Some, yes. I got out of the stock business with a whole hide. I don't think I made any money on it, and I don't think I lost much, but I finally got out with a whole hide.
Did you get out when they were pretty much still high or on the way down, or--?
Well, I kept going until I though I had wiped everything out. And finally, it went into another company. A kind called me up everyday and said, "You still got--you want to sell it?" And I said, "Yeah." "Here you are." I said, "How much?" And he said, "Well, I can get your money back." And I said, "Take it."
JD: A lot of them were just worth paper in your wallet, weren't they? The certificates?
WB: It turned out that way.
JD: Let's move up the date a bit, and we'll go back later on
to the fifties and the uranium bureau. What kind of control did the cities and the states have over these promoters that came into the area? Of course, they have a
28

 WINFORD BUNCE #1
lot of control now, and they watch the stocks very closely, but back then--
Man, you could draw up a penny stock company and start selling tomorrow. Man, they was just--it was easy to get one through.
Didn't the city fathers or the people that were in charge of legislature think anything of this? Just the fact that a lot of Utah citizens were losing maybe their life savings on just investments.
Not until this thing had been going on a while. The thing is, they were ---?---. Man, if you didn't sell it and make some money, it was your fault. As far as the city or the county are concerned, they have no way of controlling it anyway. It's controlled through the Securities Commission and this type of thing¥ And fina11y on the tail end of the uranium boom, they did get to the point where you couldn't form a company and get it recorded in business. And they tightened it up, I guess, quite a l0t. I know it's pretty hard to get these companies through and get them going right now.
JD: About what type of life did you see in Moab during the boom? Was it a tough or a hard life, or say, crowded life?
WB: Well, when the people didn't have any place to stay, it was pretty rough. I mean, they slept in their cars.
WB:
JD:
WB:
29

 WINFORD BUNCE /11
They'd have done anything. Just wasn't housing here for them, and that's all there was to it. And that's how come we got all those house trailers. See, we had sixteen hundred house trailers right here. There was more trailers than there was houses.
Did you have any severe winters during the boom?
JD: WB: JD:
WB:
JD:
I can't remember any of them that got very severe.
Can you remember what type of commission or board would have the power to regulate stocks during the boom in Utah?
I really don't know. But most of them didn't seem to have too much regulation.
How about during the fifties? Did the town itself have a policy of open credit? I mean, could you buy a lot of stuff on open credit, or was it all cash and carry?
WB: Well, they had a certain amount of credit all right, and most of them lived to regret it.
SG: Did the problems that the telephone company have and the electric al company, did this cause any s pee i al probl ems for the city or county?
WB: Well, it really didn't for the county, 'cause we were here, and if we couldn't get through for three hours, why, we could wait. We never had anything that rushing. But you might put in a call this morning at seven o'clock
and you might get it through three days later. They 30

 WINFORD BUNCE /11
really had a problem. Then about in the middle of this, we had a movie company come in here.
SG: For Apache Pass.
WB: And their guys at night would get on the telephone and
talk with their wives for an hour. Another guy would talk to his wife for an hour, and they would tie up every line you got. And then talking for four or five hours to Hollywood---?--- finance. And the companies talking back and forth. And oh man, they had it. You might get anywhere I picked up the phone one day---?--- Of course, I knew the operator, so I had a little better chance of getting through. She got me through. I was calling Denver, and I wound up talking to the operator in Pocatello, Idaho. But they were really swamped. The came out of it.
JD: When you talk about the type of store you ran during, say, when the boom came apart, was it lumber?
WB: Yes.
JD: Was it mostly lumber or was it general supplies?
WB: It was just a general lumberyard. I had everything.
JD: What were most of the miners using for cnrnerstones? Was
it four by fours, two by twos?
WB: Yeah. A lot of them finally went to two by twos. But the
ones that really mean business used four by fours.
JD: Did you have quite a bit of a run on that type of
31

 WINFORD BUNCE 111 material?
WB: Yes, oh yes. Yeah, we had a lot of that.
JD: What type of counters did you first take in? Of course,
Babel was working on some of his, but-- WB: Geiger counters?
JD: Right.
WB: The first counters I sold I believe was Lucky Stripes.
JD: Right.
WB: And then I got into Babel Counters. Of course, the new
Gordon, we sold those, and Lucky Stripe and one other
make. I can't remember what that was.
JD: Can you remember in what price range the counters you had
were?
WB: Oh, I think Lucky Stripe sold for $99.50. The Babel was,
I think, $350.00.
JD: Did you see a lot of what you would consider almost a
tourist or greenhorn walk into your store and start
picking up stuff off the shelf?
WB: I'd venture to guess that at least 50 percent of them
didn't have any idea of what they was going to do.
JD: Did you ever have to explain to them how to work one of
the geiger counters?
WB: Well, to start with, you had to show all of them how to
operate a geiger counter. They didn't know. And this Bable Counter, you know, you could tune it in and zero in
32

 WINFORD BUNCE #1 pretty good.
JD: Right.
WB: But you had to show all of them how tn operate a counter
because they just didn't have any idea.
JD: What were some of the comments? Did they say how easy it
WB:
JD: WB:
was after they bought it, or they were going to go out and make a million? What were some of the comments you heard from some of the people buying this stuff?
We didn't have too much comment about the counters, but the main comments were how they were staking, and how they were going to get rich.
They really thought they were going to make it?
One 1itt1e kid come in there one day and he said, "Man, I'm staking claims up here at the head of the valley." Told me about where he was. And I said, "Well, now, you better be careful in that area, 'cause there's a school section right in there. I don't know exactly where the corners are," I said, "but you can't stake where a school secti0n is, you know." And he said, "Well, I don't care.
I'm just staking these claims, and I'm going to get a hundred dollars a piece for them, and I don't care whether they're on a school section or not." I don't know whether he got his hundred for them or not.
JD: Did a lot of people just come in to stake for the money and sell it over, rather than mine them?
33

 WINFORDBUNCE 111
Oh yes. The fact is, I would guess in the total windup, 90 percent of the claims were staked on speculation sale.
They wasn't staking to mine.
So it was just kind of a quick turnover? Gold pastures
for everyone involved?
Right. They would take these claims, "Well, I got a thousand claims. I'll take a hundred dollars a claim for them. You got a thousand claims to put into a company. You form the company, and that's it."
Where were most of the people buying their expl0sives?
Oh, they had a couple of powder outfits in here. I think--oh, I dnn't remember which ones it was. There was a couple of them around though.
Uh, from what I understand of the powder, at least the licensing and selling of dynamite in Utah, anyone could really go up and buy powder for any reason, couldn't they?
WB: No, you can pretty well just go buy powder. And a lot of people handled it around here. And it was just one of those things that they always had, because there was always enough mining that you had to have some powder for.
JD: Did most of the people also buy t he hand equipment when 34
WB:
JD:
WB:
JD: WB:
JD:
WB:
JD: There's not too much regulation inv0lved with it.
Oh yes.

 WINFORD BUNCE 111
they came in t0 buy cornerstones and everything?
WB:
JD:
WB:
JD:
WB:
Yeah. Yeah. I sold a lot of this, especially to the guys that started to mine. I sold lots of shovels and picks and whatever they needed around the mine.
Did you also sell the different clothes, the overalls,
and--?
No, I had just carpenters' coveralls. I never went into the clothing part of it.
How about for the timbering of the mines? What was the major--?
They'd generally went to the sawmill and picked this rough stuff up: four by fours, six by sixes, eight by eights, whatever they needed.
JD: What other types of supplies besides the geiger counter and the lumber did you carry in this general operation?
WB: Oh, I had tools and everything it takes to build a house. And then I had an oil well supply business along the back.
JD: Was the petroleum industry going pretty well when the uranium was?
WB: Yeah. I was delivering this--drilling muck is what I had. I delivered them all over this end of the four states. I was the only dealer--the next dealer was over in Grand Junction and over in Price. And so I had all the wells in the whole area. The fact is, I delivered the stuff to the
35

  WINFORD BUNCE #1
field in Blanding that turned out to be a big one, and he drilled two dry holes right in what's now a field.
How about--did you have any piping at all in your store? Just plumbing.
Plumbing?
Uh huh.
Did you have anything like any of the equipment that would be used for the trucks? Anything that the truckers would come into buy?
No, I never had anything for trucks. No car equipment. I did sell air compressors and kept parts for some air compressors.
JD: WB: JD: WB: JD:
WB:
JD:
WB: JD:
WB:
What were some of the ones that you kept in stock? Do you happen to know any of the brand names?
I think I had Chicago Pneumatic and Jaggar.
Did some of the people come in and decide to buy compressors even though they were new at it? Normally--well, they might be new, but they were to the point where they were going to do some mining. When they
bought a compressor, they decided they would form a company and they would buy a compressor to do the mining. But the guy that was staking claims, all he was looking for was a cornerstake, something to drive it into the ground with, and somebody to buy it.
JD: Can you remember talking--probably if you're involved in 36

 WINFORD BUNCE 1/1
the lumber industry, you had something like a chamber of commerce that you were involved with. Can you remember talking about whether you were going to have a cash or credit. Can you remember talking that over with the different people and how the results were coming?
WB: Actually, the chamber of commerce wasn't organized until about what? Fifty six? We never had a chamber of commerce until then.
JD: Did you decide to do almost all of yours on a cash and carry?
WB: For most of this kind of stuff, I tried to get the money. But in a lumber business, you don't sell for cash. It's one of those businesses you got to charge. Say I'm going to fix my house. So I walk in, "Well, I'm going to do this on my house. I want to get this much stuff tomorrow and get this." And it goes on for a month or two. So 90 percent of the average business in a lumber yard is a charge business. To people that are building and usually, they'll pay off either at the end of the job, or every
months, or whatever it is.
JD: Did you know a lot of the l ocal people, though, when you
were selling this in your business? Did you know a lot of people who were doing the building so that you were, you know, reasonably assured of having some profit come back to you?
37

 WINFORD BUNCE 111
WB: Well, I knew all of them actually. The fact is, more or
less I acted as the contractor. And I had these carpenters, maybe two or three carpenters together, and everybody that wanted to build a house, or repair a house, or put down a new floor or a new roof, or whatever they wanted, they called me. So I'd gather up one of these sets of builders and we'd go take the job. I'd figure the material, and they'd figure the labor. So then I'd get paid, and then I'd give them theirs.
JD: Did you ever have people come in with maybe even samples of uranium and turn it on to the geiger counters just to test it and see what it was like?
WB: Oh, yeah. They used to do this every day. Somebody'd come in if they found something, well, is this good or is it bad, and uranium is something you can't eyeball and tell how good it is. So they'd find it, and if they didn't
have enough money to buy a counter, why, they'd come by
and test their ore.
SG: Well, did any of it really hit any high grade stuff and
let out a whoop or something when they hit it?
WB: Oh yeah. I seen five hundred pounds that went 97 percent.
JD: It was 97 percent? WB: Uh h u h .
JD: Did you take a portion of this just f0r your service?
WB: No. He was working on a bonus deal or something like
38

 WINFORD BUNCE #1
that, and you had to have five hundred pounds to get this
or something. It was a black---?---. But that really set
it up.
JD: Did you get what you'd call in the jargon of the
industry, did you sort of get the uranium fever yourself, even though you weren't out in the field, or did you pretty much stay away from it?
WB: I pretty well stayed away from the field. I was so busy that I didn't have time. Time I was running this muck business and this lumber yard, I was working twenty-four hours a day anyhow. If you got half a dozen oil wells, they always want something at night, so you're up all day and all night loading trucks up to get to these ore fields, and then running the rest of the business in the daytime. I didn't have the time to actually get out and do much with it.
JD: What different arrangements did you have to make with your store when the boom came in? What different accommodations did you have to make or what enlargements?
WB: Didn't do any enlarging at all. I sold out before the actual house building started. It took years in here before people were coming, getting around to building
houses. Because nobody knows if they're going to be here, so nob ody is goin g t o invest money to build houses. We had an awful time interesting FHA to come in here and
39

 WINFORD BUNCE /11
finance a bunch of houses. They just said, "We11, it's just a boom, and it isn't going to last. We're not going to put FHA money into it." It just takes time until people come to this point that they could get financing for these houses. They just actually started to build houses about the time I sold out.
JD: Can you remember any merchants in the area who may be invested their money wrong or bought the wrong parts and went broke or had to sell out because of bad investments they made during the era?
WB: I don't think so. I don't know of any that did. Most of them actually done pretty well. Of course, some of them ound up with quite a lot of bad debts, but this is something that when you're charging that you got to expect.
JD: Did a lot of new parts stores come into the area to supply the different needs?
WB: Oh yes. See, Tate equipment moved in from out of Salt Lake about '53, I guess, with a complete mining setup with everything take it takes to mine. That's their business and they moved in and set up here. We had them. We got parts houses for trucks and stuff. There was quite
a need for that kind of stuff, and we didn't have any of
it here.
SG: How about miners? When you talk about miners, what was
40

  WINFORD BUNCE #1
the general impression of the townspeople of what a miner was? What was the kind of stereotype that ---?--- the people? What was the miner's life like?
W ell, most of them, the people t hat actually lived here, had been through this mine---?--- They though nothing about it.
WB:
SG:
WB:
JD:
WB:
JD:
WB:
Did the miners pretty well blend in with just the rest of the folks and were just considered one of the group?
Oh, yeah. You couldn't tell the difference. You were assimilated pretty fast in Moab.
How about the miners themselves? Did they ever come--did you have a lot of friends who were miners, or who wanted to grubstake that you might talk out of it? Or what was your relationship with miners?
Well, I had a lot of friends that were in the mining business. Not too many grubstaking or anything. I charge to a lot of them, as far as this is concerned. But it was, "I'll charge it and I'll pay it." This is it.
You think that there was a lot more credibility to a person's word before the boom than after when you actually had a smaller population and you knew everyone? Oh sure. The thing is, with the boom, you get all kinds of people. And you get people that don't figure on ever paying their bills to start with. Most of the trouble with the boom is that you get these drifters, and you
41

     WINFOHD BUNCE # 1
don't know who they are, and nobody knows who they are. You can't even get a credit line on them or anything. So, no, it made it a lot worse because before that time, everybody was here. They was not going anywhere. They owned a home, they were all tied up here, and they couldn't go anywhere. So if you didn't get your money
this year, you might get it next.
JD: How about when the A.E.C. finally started building roads
in the area and started increasing the different places that people could go to for drilling and mining? What happened to the county after the A.E.C. pulled out? Did the county try to maintain most of these roads or what happened?
WB: 0h, oh, they was a11 maintainect¥ The roacts the A¥E.C. built in cooperation with us at the time were still good, permanent--built up better roads than they were then because they were built where the county wanted the roads.
JD: You think there was quite a big of agreement, close work, close ties between the county and the state and federal governments so that this would come about? Do you think there was a good degree of workability between these different organizations?
WB: Oh, I think there was. I know we worked real close with A. E. C. The state, they don't get into this kind of road
42

     WINFORD BUNCE #1
anyway. The state doesn't get into this outlying stuff. They stay with state highways and that's it. The county and the A. E.C ., we got al ong real well with them.
SG: What other bureaus opened up at the time of the boom to try and regulate either the mine industry or the miners themselves? Can you remember any of them?
WB: None that I know of.
JD: Were a lot of the different positions that--you said you
WB:
JD:
WB: JD:
WB: JD: WB:
had a small police force before. Were a lot for them enlarged to meet the capabilities, or meet the demands of the community.
Oh, we had one city marshal, and then they went to about a four or five man police force just quick.
How about the licensing? I don't know if you went to the licensing of the different mining explorations or different businesses. Did you?
No.
Let's take an example of either the potash or the Atlas Mill. What type of license do they have from the county or from the city?
Nothing. Nothing.
How about the tax revenue? How is that decided?
Well, they're assessed by the state tax commission or the county assessor on a valuation basis. And they have a net proceeds tax and all this stuff.
43

  WINFORD BUNCE 1/1
JD: How about your school districts? You have some certain
school districts around here set up for assessment don't
you?
WB: Well, yeah. The school district puts on their own mill
levy. What they do, everybody in the city, and the school district, or any other taxing districts sets their levy and turns them over to the county. The county takes them and sends them to the state, and gets them approved, and then that becomes your total tax levy. See, we set our levy the other night so we have to fill out the little form and give it to the county clerk. The county clerk takes it theirs, outs, the school district's, the fire district, and sends them into the state. The state approves them and then they make up the tax levy.
JD: When you think of the future, do you think that Moab will--because of the nuclear reactors, do you think that it will be a mining industry? Do you think that this will have a big part to play in Moab's future, the peaceful use of atomic energy?
WB: Oh, I think uranium definitely will. I don't think there's any question about that. Uranium's here to stay. And they got this new mine opening up out here in Lisbon. This Rio Alto?
JD: Right, the Canadian.
WB: Sure, it's going to be a big outfit. And people are going
44

 WINFORD BUNCE #1
going to be deep drilling and the small boy can't cut her. He's going to stake the claims and he's going to wind up with a percentage or something. And that's it.
JD: You think it's just the dawn of the big company then?
WB: Yeah. Well, Rio Alto showed this. No individual could run out there and test drill that stuff twenty-seven hundred
feet down. That takes a lot of money. I don't know how many hundred holes they drilled out there, but no small boy is going to do this kind of stuff. And the gopher- hole shovel stuff is pretty well gone. Well, there isn't, I don't think, much chance for a small miner as such. I think in staking claims, sure, they're going to stake the claims, and they're going to sell them, and trade them off, and this kind of stuff.
SG: Okay. Thank you very much.
47
