RG: Mr. Palmer, first of all I'd like to ask you about your background and your involvement with the uranium industry and your position in it.
RP: My position was manager and executive director of the Colorado Mining Association which was composed of members and prospectors who were active and actively engaged in seeking out sources of uranium on the Colorado Plateau and elsewhere in the West. My functions were primarily to do each and every thing which was considered desirable to encourage the mining of uranium on the Colorado Plateau. I spent a great many months in Washington helping get the program under way. The first accomplishment was with the attorneys for the Atomic Energy Commission. The president had issued an order withdrawing uranium areas from location. I worked out a deal with the attorneys for the Atomic Energy Commission whereby the carnotite ores of the Colorado Plateau could be located for vanadium and if uranium was found in conjunction with the vanadium then permits would be secured from the federal government for production of
uranium.
RG: What time was this? What general period?

 ROBERTS. PALMER
RP: Now, I've had a heart attack and I suppose that
combined with age has hurt my memory, but it was under President Truman, and it was the very early stages of the uranium program, and I've forgotten just exactly when that did start. For example, I don't think it has to be recorded, but for example, I was working with Senator Millet and Senator Johnson when the president was being urged to release all the atomic energy information to the British. And there was no indication that there was any uranium of any consequence in the United States. And the question was could the United States government provide an incentive program to encourage people to go out and find new deposits of uranium in various parts of the country. The question arose as to whether, under international relations with other countries, friendly relations, whether we should pay more for
domestic production than we did foreign production. The price was established, of course, in South Africa in particular, and the state department feared that there would be conflicts if we paid more for domestic production. It was under this program that we worked out a bonus system for production of uranium on the Colorado Plateau in which the distance from the mine to the mill where the ore was purchased was taken
2

 ROBERTS. PALMER
into consideration in arriving at the price. The Colorado Mining Association was the first mining association in the country to invite a member of the commission to come west and explain these programs to the miners in the West, and the first member of the commission was Sumner Pike who was from Maine and was a member of the commission. In other words, our government worked out a program of incentive payments to the uranium producers to get them to go out and
find additional sources of uranium to protect the national defense and interests of this country against full disclosure of all our atomic secrets to foreign countries who were demanding that this be done before they would supply us with additional uranium. See, the original experiments on uranium and for use in the atomic bomb were conducted on materials which had been sent in from South Africa and after the experiments were successful why then they decided to cut it off, unless we had some in this country. This, I mention because I think it illustrates that this country has great potential in mineral production if proper incentives and encouragement is given to people knowledgeable in mineral production to go out and produce new supplies. It was the Charlie Steens and the Vernon
3

 ROBERTS. PALMER
Picks and--I'm trying to think of that fellow's name over in Monticello that had the Happy Jack down White Canyon and I can't think of his name. It started with "G." He was a very good friend of mine. I was trying to think of it the other day. Anyhow, these were the people that went forth into isolated areas, areas which had not been known for mineral production before, and through their search brought forth mineral supplies which were badly needed in the national interest. And here I must say that I was contacted by many of the engineers and geologists and executives of the major mining companies in the country and asked why I didn't have the prospectors contact them because their stockholders are complaining that individuals had gone out and found these deposits where big companies were not prominent
in this development at all. Big companies came in after the prospectors had found the mineral deposits and tried to buy out these individuals. The purchase programs for uranium were started largely by the groups that I represented. In other words, the buying station at Grand Junction was established there largely through the efforts of the senators from our area and from our old office. Oh, many problems arose on the Colorado Plateau before the industry settled
4

 ROBERTS. PALMER
down and got going in good shape. The question was of ore hauling and roads and proper locations of mills and granting permits for mills at proper locations so that shippers could get adequate return for their
shipments to enable them to meet payrolls and take off workman's compensation and various costs which are involved in mining operations. I was thoroughly familiar with all the problems of all the uranium producers on the Colorado Plateau and in adjacent states because we had in Denver each year an annual conference or clinic. At which time we brought to Denver all the top uranium authorities of the world and all government officials who had anything to do with uranium production. And these clinics attracted four and five thousand people. One year we had to move from the Shirley-Savoy Hotel over to the new Mile High Center in order to accommodate the thousands of people who were in attendance at the convention. I personally did a lot of drilling and operating of mines on the plateau, and was thoroughly familiar with all of the problems. I even did some prospecting in other states, including the first uranium production from the state of Nevada, which was shipped to Salt Lake City to the mill there and was very difficult to treat because it was the
5

 ROBERTS . PALMER
primary ore of uranium, and none of that type of ore had been found prior to that time. I drilled properties just north of Steen and had the very
formations he had, but uranium was a little erratic, and the theory was that it had come up in hot water solutions up around the La Sal Mountains and had penetrated the sedimentary beds and that when these hot water solutions hit a log or a carbonaceous material why it dropped a load, but if it didn't hit a carbonaceous material or calcite or something else that would cause the solution to form a solid body, why it á just wasn't there. And I think the United States Geological Survey was very helpful in the entire program, and the camps that they had with a great many geologists on the plateau, was quite helpful to the prospectors and developers. If you'd ask some questions I'd be a lot better off.
RG: Okay. First of all I'd 1ike to talk about the AEC which you've mentioned. Now what did you think of their policy on domestic uranium procurement? Did you think it was equitable?
RP: I thought it was very equitable. In fact, after mining conferences these policies were developed, designed to help aid and assist the miners in the production of uranium.
6

 ROBERTS. PALMER
RG: During these early years after the war, do you think
anyone on the plateau realized how large the reserves
really were?
RP: No. As an illustration, one of the principal speakers
for Kuhn-Loeb and Company, the company that was responsible for the financing of many of the major mining companies throughout the world, made a speech in New York in which he said there wasn't any substantial deposits of uranium on the, in the United States; that investors should not invest in production of uranium in the United States, but should consider investing in Canada and South Africa and elsewhere.
RG: If most of the people on the Colorado Plateau thought the reserves were this low also, why was there such a movement towards domestic uranium production then?
RP: There was a violent need for it. It was a patriotic thing to do in the first place. And the second place was that the miners are all optimists. They all feel that they're going to find a million dollars. And when this program was designed to encourage search for this uranium, why they all went out and started looking for it, and prospecting every area that they
thought might be prolific. No one had any idea of the extent of the deposition including the famous
7

 ROBERTS. PALMER
characters in the uranium development, like Charlie Steen, hadn't the slightest idea. I knew him quite well before he made his strike, and I can say he had no concept of it either.
RG: What did you think of the big business, the part that big business played in uranium industry? Companies like USVC and VCA and those were the two primary ones during the early years.
RP: Well, I think they helped provide knowledgeable markets for the products of the mines. I don't consider that they had anything to do with the primary development of the mines. They had, of course, been interested in the plateau and vanadium and even in radium. The history of the plateau, of course, is that we produced about $18 million worth of radium from carnotite ores prior to the time that vanadium was in short supply and the boats were being sunk bringing vanadium to the American shores, why there was a big upsurge in activity on the plateau for the vanadium from the carnotite ores. And uranium
was stockpiled. I remember when uranium had practically no value and was being used to color glass and various paints of various kinds and I used to see stockpiles of uranium that had no commercial value whatever. I remember then of being associated
8

 ROBERTS. PALMER
with men who were trying to keep the secret from me that uranium was now of great value and was essential
RG:
in the national defense.
During this period that you mentioned, USVC collected many tons of tailings from several mills and processed them.
RP: Yes, that's right.
RG: And as a result they were sued by the miners against
this company for the use of this without payment. How
do you feel about that?
RP: Well, I don't have any particular feelings on that
subject because it's been the policy of buyers of ores for years to gyp the miners out of their full and complete payments. For example, there are stockpiles of slag that are being retreated by smelters in which minerals are being extracted from which their original shippers receive no payment whatever. I feel that in the case of gold--if the gold mine, that the gold price was increased from $20.67 to $35.00 primarily because shippers of ores and concentrates in the United States to Canadian smelters were receiving payments for minerals which they had never received payments for in the United states, in America sm elters. This is but a continuation of the process--when this ore was
9

 ROBERTS . PALMER
purchased it was purchased for vanadium content and was not purchased for the uranium content, and if I sell ore to you at a price and you find something in it that I don't ask for or ask remuneration for, why I feel I'm the one that's responsible and not necessarily you, unless you are knowledgeable of it at the time. I don't think there's any evidence that the purchasers of uranium ore knew at the time that they purchased it that it was going to have great value. I may be wrong on this. But as far as I know I don't have any particular criticism. I have no part in the suit which was brought by an opportunist who was the former governor of our of our state who I haven't any particular admiration for.
RG: Uh huh. You mentioned that ore buyers were always trying to gyp the miners and in that same vein there's been many complaints about the miners cheating on ore sampling, by the big companies. I was wondering if you'd care to comment about that.
RP: I went into that quite thoroughly and I found no evidence of that whatever. I happened to be operating a little uranium mine and shipping uranium at the time myself and I had the man who conducted the studies as an employee at my mine and he pointed out
that from day to day there was a difference in the 10

 ROBERTS. PALMER
value of our ore or the uranium content. And the fact that you took ore one day and shipped it to VCA at
Durango and the next day took it and shipped it to Uranium, or to used to be, to Union Carbide at Rifle or Uravan didn't mean that the companies were trying to gyp the shippers. Frankly I don't think that either one of those companies could afford to have that kind of policy. And while I received no payments whatever from those companies rising to their defense, nevertheless I felt they were getting far more than the miners for the uranium that they milled and treated and sent to the government. And I didn't think they could gyp the miners by giving them false
returns on their shipments. That was my opinion.
RG: What do you think the basis was for that complaint? RP: Well, it's natural among miners, and I've been among
miners most of my life, it's natural for miners to gripe about the returns they get for shipments. I've never yet seen a miner go into a vein of ore and take a sample that he didn't take the richest part of the vein, and he knows very well that the rest of it isn't as high grade as that particular section. Yet he always feels that he should be paid for the amount of the ore that he shipped on the basis of that rich sample. And that's characteristic of miners and has
11

 ROBERTS . PALMER
been for years and years. Not just uranium miners, but every kind of miners. When we had custom mills in Colorado, the miners always told me that ore buyers were cussed out and cursed constantly when they were paying for ore. So it's not an unusual situation at
all.
RG: Another complaint of many of the small miners was
that during the early years the AEC was incompetent and that many of the people that worked for them didn't have a feel for the uranium industry.
RP: I think this is true. I think that of any government agency that is not well-informed when it's first set up and when it first starts to operate, but I found that most of the AEC personnel were dedicated men and trying to do the best they could. I know that there are a few men that had a feeling that leases were granted on a basis of preference and I now know enough about government to know that there is preference within government circles. I have spent a great deal of my life lobbying in Washington working
with congressmen and senators and agencies of the government, and I can say that I do feel that wealthy concerns have more influence than independent miners. That it was for that reason that I spent thirty-six years of my life trying to help the independent
12

 ROBERTS. PALMER
miners and the ones that didn't have influence in the nation's capital or perhaps in the capitals of the
respective states. And I think that the law firms that represent some of these wealthy companies that received great fees for their services do wield a great deal of influence on the judgment of federal agencies. But I didn't find this to be true in the Atomic Energy Commission. And I made a pretty thorough study of it. I think as thorough study as anyone and here I want to say to you quite frankly that as far as I know I was active in or participated in or took sole action in the only legislation that was ever passed of benefit to the small miners in the uranium business. The first was the increasing of the depletion allowance from 12.5 percent to 23 percent on the first one hundred thousand pounds of ore produced. And this was the only way that the small miners ever made any money out of production. Had it not been for this legislation, they wouldn't have done it because their costs were extremely high and except in those cases where rich ore was found, which was seldom, most of the producers were not operating mines at a profit. Where you had a mill in conjunction with your mining operation and could take the depletion allowances on the end product of the
13

 ROBERTS . PALMER
mill, then of course you were in a better position to realize a profit than without a mill. And that was true of Charlie Steen. The exploration allowance of up to the first one hundred thousand tons was passed through the activity of the Colorado Mining Association and my efforts in Washington. Here I will say that I'm not running for anything, and I don't have any desire to get any credit. I've been patted on the back by hundreds of uranium producers and thanked for the activities in which I engaged and so
I have nothing up my sleeve to gain one way or another in presenting the facts to you. I did study mining law under the dean of all mining lawyers at the University of Colorado--Dean Fleming, and led my class. I inspired studies through the cooperative work of the United States Geological Survey in the state of Colorado in areas which, when uranium was found there, were ready for distribution which otherwise would not have been available to prospectors for prospecting purposes had it not been that we had this work done prior to the years that the uranium boom was on. And it was our feeling that
the best help we could give to prospectors was to give them a map of the district and the geological studies which had been conducted there, so they would
14

 ROBERTS. PALMER
know the formations in which uranium would be possibly found. On the other hand, I want to point out that there were some cautious geologists and mining engineers that urged prospectors to stay out of certain areas which were later found to be quite prolific. The story's told about the Indian in New Mexico that couldn't read English and didn't know better than to go in and find the great uranium deposits which later were on the Santa Fe Railroad
right of way, and were taken over at the request of the AEC by the Anaconda Mining Company and produced. Also it might be said that one of the largest uranium deposits in New Mexico was found by a scintillator in an aircraft driven by a girl and that the geologist was asleep in the back seat when the scintillator started to show values, and he was awakened and this is how this large deposit was discovered. I might show you, if you care to see it an award or prize that was given to me by the Canadian Prospectors, Developers Association on which is a sample of each type of uranium that was found in appreciation of the work that I had done for the uranium industry, and r have this placard here. It has samples of the ore from every one of the deposits in Canada--the major deposits. I never was given anything like that in the
15

 ROBERTS. PALMER United States--
RG: You mentioned the AEC leasing policy. I'm quite sure that you are aware of the 1955 hearings.
RP: Yeah, I was, I testified.
RG: And I was wondering, you mentioned that you thought
the policy was a good one and that it didn't favor the big business interests. Now which do you, could you go into that a little deeper--the AEC leasing policy?
RP: The officials of the AEC with whom I discussed the problems of production were fearful that we wouldn't be able to meet our quotas or to meet the required production standards. There were a lot of people on the plateau who were inexperienced and who were seeking leases. And these men who were charged with the responsibility of production naturally sought out the most competent people they could find. In some instances these people were associated with major mining companies. Reference was made in the hearing to the Kamm-Rummel lease and complaint was filed by an adversary of mine by the name of Norm Edley who was a close associate of the governor. He was financed by the Newmont Mining Company, and that he didn't secure a lease. I don't know what the facts are regarding this lease, but I do know that the
16

 ROBERTS. PALMER
majority of the leases, at least, were made on a fair and equitable basis. Now I have no criticism whatsoever of the Atomic Energy Commission or the people who are in charge of the program as to how
these leases were made. Mr. Edley stated in the hearing that I had gotten the lease for Mr. Rummel through my close contacts with the Atomic Energy Commission, and of course I denied this because I'd had nothing to do with it and didn't even know that Tom Rummel was getting the lease nor why he got it except that he was a capable contractor and had had experience in moving dirt quickly and rapidly and had had adequate financial support and proved that he was a good businessmen and realized quite considerable profits through his activities. I think any program of this type launched as fast as this program was launched by the federal government would have been subject to criticism regardless how it had been handled. I was trying to be fair in my judgment as to how to it was handled. I do think, however, in watching government agencies that there is in every agency a tendency to submit to the mandates of big business. And I am not particularly an admirer of big business. As a matter of fact, I think my dismissal from the Colorado Mining Association after thirty-six
17

 ROBERTS. PALMER
years of service can be charged largely to the activities of big business who were not convinced that I would always abide by their calling but would use my good judgment as to whether they were right or wrong which I always did.
RG: Uh huh. Just recently the AEC had mentioned that they are going to lease lands again, while they're seriously considering leasing land again, the ones that were withdrawn originally during the early period that have never been leased. And they're going to use a program that is quite similar under competitive bidding. And I was wondering if you cared to comment about this, whether you think it would be good to the small miners.
RP: No, I don't think it would be fair to the small miners because I feel that in competitive bidding, the man with the most money, of course, is able to get the lease, or is able to employ competent personnel which would give him information which an ordinary individual would not have. Personally I think that the drawings for leases was far more equitable than bidding for the highest bidder. I am opposed to the leasing system based on the highest
bidder because I don't think it's fair to the small miners at all.
18

 ROBERTS. PALMER
RG: Also, well, beginning in '52 and '53 there was a new
danger involved in mining that previously hadn't been dealt with--that's the radon dotter danger, and many of the small miners were forced to use ventilation equipment to combat this. I was wondering if you would care to comment on this.
RP: I attended many conferences on safety and ventilation, particularly in Salt Lake City, where it was brought out that there were no competent technical advisers who could say positively that uranium dust was detrimental to the lungs of the miners. Many contended that miners are prone to smoke cigarettes and some of them were chain smokers and that they had weakened their lungs to such an extent that it couldn't positively be said that their injury to the lung was caused by radon dotters, gases of various kinds, or whether it was due to cigarette
smoke. I do think that fanatics in safety sometimes recommend equipment which is far too expensive for the rank and file miners. However, I have been called upon by 1iterally hundreds of workers in mines or miners telling me of their experiences with the medical profession and pronouncing them injured by radon gas and prophesying that their life expectancy was limited. I personally was visiting a great many
19

 ROBERTS. PALMER
mines all the time on the plateau and was in mines where there was very little ventilation and suppose that I may be one of the subjects to the inroads of
radon gas. But personally, I felt that most miners did what they could to provide adequate ventilation within 1imited resources, and here again the thing that's hard for people generally to understand is that these miners are trying to make a living for themselves and their families and are not aware of the dangers of radon gas, nor were they being advised by men competent in those particular fields. I attended most of these conferences, and I never got the impression that any competent expert knew positively that radon gas was injurious to the lungs until later after the uranium boom was over. But here again I must say that I knew the situation and knew that the small miners were not able to put on the type of equipment which later was recommended by the various types and sundry government agencies. This of course is not popular today because everybody today has been trained or told of the advantages of safety in mines and safety includes breathing as well as other types of safety. This was not known in the early days of the uranium industry, because nobody had any experience with radon tars, including the
20

 ROBERTS. PALMER major companies.
RG: Earlier in the interview, you mentioned that you did a lot of drilling. I was wondering where you did your drilling and what type--diamond bit, core sample-- what type equipment you used?
RP: We used every type of equipment. I built a road which was sometimes referred to as the Palmer Highway out across the valley, which ended of north of Steen's properties, and we drilled between along the Big Indian area and down to 450 feet in depth; found the
formations but never found the solutions. They had unloaded, as I indicated to you, as to my theory of the deposition of uranium on the plateau. Then later we drilled north of Dove Creek where I operated a mine called the Falcon Mine, which was next to an AEC withdrawal. We shipped uranium ore that went as high as 12 percent as compared to Steen's .24 and I thought I was going to be in the millionaire class. And this ore rolled and pitched and we lost the extent of it, and we kept drilling to find it underground and never could find it. So I've shipped ore, I think, that was as rich as any from the Colorado Plateau. I geologized the property which later became the E. L. Cord property and sold this property to E. L. Cord, and thought I 'd made some
21

 ROBERTS. PALMER
money until Uncle Sam took three-fourths of it away
from me because they considered it a regular income instead of a long term capital gain because I had very little invested in it. Just aside, let me tell you this story. I think you might be interested. I was to meet Charlie Steen up at his property in the early days before he had his mine in operation. He just had a little, few drills going in the side of the hill. He had a boarding house there and some employees. And he was kind of an eccentric sort of a guy as you probably know. So I was to meet him there at one o'clock. The road up to the property at that time was through draws and I got some sand in my brakes and I had a hell of a time getting up there. I got there late. And when I arrived there he wasn't there. So I sat down on a rock to kind of rest, and I heard a voice say, "Well, Bob Palmer, what the hell you doing up here?" This was a lady's voice and she was Charlie's cook, and she said Charlie had gone. He couldn't wait for you. Come on up to the boarding house and I'll give you a glass of milk and piece of pie." I said, "Boy, I'd sure welcome that." While I was seated there, why she said, "I have, my husband and I have a son that we want to educate, send to college, so we asked Charlie how we could get into
22

 ROBERTS. PALMER
this uranium boom. And he said, 'Don't buy any stock because it's dangerous.' He said, 'Go out and locate some claims.'" And she finally told him that she didn't know anything about locating any claims. And he said, "Well, get your husband to go out." And she
said he didn't know anything about it. And he said, "I'll give you a couple of my men and you can go out north here of my properties and locate some claims." So they located three and these, the validity of these today would be questioned because there were no discovery, but at that particular time people were reasonably honest on the plateau and miners were inclined to recognize each other's locations. In other words, they were staked and the discovery notice was put on the claim and when these were found, most miners were inclined to respect those and they were doing it on the Big Indian area. See I had, everybody knew me on the plateau, and everybody was stopping and asking me about this or that or the other thing and they asked me to come with their companies. They were offering me all kinds of jobs,
directorship, and so forth which I felt at the time I shouldn't take because I felt I was representing the entire industry and that, I didn't feel that--But anyhow, here was a friend and she had given me a
23

 ROBERTS. PALMER
piece of pie and a glass of milk and I appreciated it, and I asked, "Well, what do you want for the claims." She said, "Five thousand dollars." That ought to help get their son through college. Well, I was traveling back and forth from Denver. I'd make at least two trips a week going back and forth. We had an office in Grand Junction. We had a fellow from Cortez in that office. But that was later. But I had a friend by the name of Fred Frazier--maybe you've heard his name mentioned. He was from Moab. He has never gone beyond the fourth grade in college, but he was knowledgeable of every area in the Colorado Plateau up there, he and another fellow whose name I've forgotten, which I can find, of course, was a sheepherder and they had gone over most of this area and knew it. So I was in Moab and I bumped into this lady, and she said, "Mr. Palmer, did you do anything
with those claims." And I said, "No." And I said, "Frankly, I hadn't given it any thought at all" because I had had so darn many things that were on my--I was working night and day trying to get this thing coordinated. And she said, "Well, we would want fifteen thousand dollars for those claims, now." There was a little more interest in the area. And she introduced to me Pix Pauling and he had a claim next
24

 ROBERTS. PALMER
to it, and I never will forget the name of it. It was called the "Falsey" and he wanted five thousand dollars for that. So that would be twenty thousand dollars for the four claims. Well, I didn't have anybody contact me until finally Frazier called me one day and he said, "Say Palmer, you were talking to me about those claims that lady had up there." He
said, "That area is hotter than hell." He said, "You've got some friends, why don't you try and sell them for me. I've got an option on them for fifteen days." I says, "You have." And I says, "What's the price?" And he said, "A hundred thousand dollars a claim." And I said, "Have you gone nuts?" And he said, "No, I think they're worth it." And of course people in this business were not talking about actual money and a lot of them got into trouble tax-wise because they put a million dollar price on a group of claims and maybe they have five thousand dollars, you know, and the rest of it was to be paid out of production or something and the federal government later ruled that was purchase of property and that they owed an income tax on the total purchase price and they all got in trouble. Heidi, stop it! [to dog] So it will only take a minute to finish this because
there's thousands of stories but this is a good one. 25

 ROBERTS. PALMER
And in the meantime Sunder McCarrin, had a kind of hometown boy in Nevada that represented him, looked after his interests out there and keeping in touch with what was going on. So he called me and said,
"Bob, we've got some claims down on the plateau and when you' re over there, " and he said, "I'm sending you a letter describing it to you. We'd appreciate your looking into them because we're trying to get the uranium business." So I went over there and there was an expression called "goat pasture," and that's just exactly what they were in my opinion. Of course, a lot of the goat pasture that people passed judgment on proved to be prolific. But as far as I could see and as far as I had studied the maps there were no indications that there had been any solutions pass through this particular area. So I suggested that they forget these claims. "Well," they said, "Well, if you ever find anything of any value let us know." So I called them up when he called me up, and I called them up out in Reno and told them that there was an area that it looked to me like they could have a lot of fun drilling if they wanted to drill. I had no assurances that there was any uranium there, but it looked to me like it was an area in which there probably, or there could be some good deposition. So
26

 ROBERTS. PALMER
they said, "We ' 11 meet you in Grand Junction" such and such a day. Well, like the Shumways at that time I was driving a Lincoln. I was driving a Lincoln primarily because my wife had, I'd had a small heart attack. One that wasn't as serious as the one I had
later and going over the Continenetal Divide and back twice a week, my wife was concerned about me driving Fords and she thought I could get better off, that I'd be safer in a Lincoln. But anyhow I remember I met Cord at Grand Junction and it was on the day that the Uranium Ore Producers were organizing an exhibit over there. I had promised to be there, and I had a question in my mind as to which I was going to do. Someone disliked the fact that they saw me there and didn't see me at the meeting because I went over to Moab with Mr. Cord. Well, he had his attorney, Mr. Newhoff from Los Angeles and a couple of his associates with him, this fellow represented Sunder McCarrin, and I couldn't show them anything. I took them up on the hill and showed them the area but you couldn't even get a geiger count. But it was in the area I thought--here was the La Sal Mountains, I
explained to him. The solutions came up through, around the La Sals flowed into these beds carried these solutions, in there was some deposition, bound
27

to be some places. I had drilled the area and I knew the formations were in there. Finally he said, "All right, I'll take them," he said, "providing you come over here and operate them." And I said, "Ah hell, I can't do that." And he said, "Why not?" And I said, "Hell, I've got a job and I'm representing the industry." And he said, "No, you haven't got a job." He said, "They'll turn you down the first chance they get." He said, "They're just using you for the knowledge you have!" And how right he was. I didn't realize how right he was. I should have taken the job. But I was conscientious, very conscientious. I had a reputation for honesty and integrity and I was damn sure I was going to keep it. And he finally said, "What do you recommend?" And I said, "Why don't you let your lawyer, he's here, why don't you let him run it." He says, "He don't know a damn thing about mining." So finally he accepted my recommendation to a friend of a friend .of mine and who had gone with me over there because my wife didn't want me to travel
alone. And he said, "What's his recommendation?" And I said, "Wel1, he went broke in the tungsten mining business in Boulder County and he knows mining but he's out of a job." So he finally put him on and they found incidentally the richest, not the richest, but

the largest uranium deposit on the plateau. It had a lot of lime in it. It was difficult to treat but it was a bigger property than Steen's. And he used to come over to our conventions and he said to me, "Bob, you have an interest in this." And I said, "I don't have anything in writing and I don't have a broker's
license and I can't enforce any obligation." He was good enough to pay me eighty thousand bucks which I told you I gave most of it to the federal government. But after he had purchased my interest in it, I read in the paper where he sold his property for sixteen million. The point that I'm trying to make is--
[END OF SIDE ONE]
RP: --that here was a property that was offered to me for
five thousand bucks when nobody wanted it, then fifteen thousand bucks and nobody wanted it, and then a one hundred thousand dollars a claim for the three claims plus the Falsey of the--. So there was four hundred thousand dollars and they sold the property for sixteen million. Of course, they'd sunk a shaft 450 feet and they had found this terrific ore body. But that's the sort of thing it is. That's why I'm one of those who feels that the present trends, and I don't want to take your time on this either, but my personal feeling is that the present trends largely
29

 ROBERTS. PALMER
sponsored by fish and game groups and conservationists, drive prospectors off the public domain is a serious mistake as far as the future of the country is concerned. And of course the big mining interests now are condoning it and recommending that in order to prospect on an area you have to put up a bond. And where would have Charlie Steen got a bond or where would have Vernon Pick got a bond? You can't get a bond for goodness sakes if you don't have any money. And then, too, they're insisting that the surface be restored to its original condition, and this eliminates the small guy is what I am trying to say. There isn't going to be any more prospectors there after they get this new type of legislation passed and the American Mining Congress and all the businesses in the country are--. You see, you will find people probably, maybe you haven't, but others have found people who are quite critical of me or have a dislike for me because I didn't know it all--don't get me wrong, but I tried to be fair to everybody, and I didn't have any political desires to play it on a political basis, nor did I have any desire to kiss the ass of any
major company. Therefore, I have a motto up here--I did have. "Work Hard , Integrity, Diligence, and
30

 ROBERTS. PALMER
Honesty, and get Screwed." That's exactly what I've done. And even cutting off my two hundred dollars a month retirement pay after thirty-six years of
service in the mining industry in which I can prove that I did more for the industry than any other man in the country. So all I'm trying to say to you, if you in your interview with me have any feeling that I'm inclined to favor the big fellow, you're mistaken as hell because I know now and I watched everything that they've done that they take advantage of the little guy in every possible way, no matter. As matter of fact, after I sold this property to E. L. Cord I had three or four of the majors contact me through their bill men and so forth saying, "Why in the hell didn't you call that to our attention." Well, the facts are that the people who take the risk, Mr. Cord was willing to take a risk. There wasn't any evidences of uranium there when he started, and he was enough of a gambler or prospector to a drill a hole where no one had drilled before while majors were inclined to play the sure thing. When somebody found something like they went to Charlie and tried to take his mine away from him. And same way, of course, I don't know about Pick, what the situation there was. But anyway, big business is
31

 ROBERTS. PALMER
dangerous. On the other hand, I want to point out to you that if you're a director in a big company, you're drawing 80, 90, 100 thousand a year or some presidents now are drawing 320 thousand dollars a year, you can't go out and spend the company money in an area where there's never been any indication of mineralization because you've got to justify your actions if you're going to keep the remunerative job,
justify your actions from production. Therefore they don't take chances. Now these prospectors, they went out and took chances. All they had to lose was their life or the lives of their families; their mothers or their sisters or their sweethearts or their wives or whatnot. And there were all kinds of people on the Colorado Plateau, in Wyoming, and Pumpkin Hill Gap, and all the rest of the areas. What I'm trying to say to you, the days of the type of prospectors and the small miners who developed the uranium industry are over. The big people did not develop it. Now, those days are over. If we get into a situation where we have to have minerals in the future, I don't look with much favor upon the present proposals. There are a hell of a lot of interesting sidelights to all these things that I love to tell, and could fill an evening when maybe I'm thinking a little bit clearer
32

 ROBERTS. PALMER
than I am today, but--I do appreciate any opportunity to tell what I saw and know about the industry.
Uh huh.
I could te ll you about something about the eccentricities of some of them, the time that I had all the four and even the prospector from Canada that was a famous prospector. I had them all in Denver at a banquet and two weeks after I got this dirty letter from Steen giving me hell for not giving him an award. I had given four awards to the four independent prospectors that had found the biggest properties. He had forgotten áthat I looked for him at of the head table when he was supposed to be there at the salutary dinner. Went down in the basement at the men's room of the Shirley and found him drunk with his face flat on the floor in the men's room of the basement of the Shirley. And he gave me hell for not giving him the award. Now Vernon Pick who was the other guy that did real well--one of them, he's got a house right down here two blocks from me, south, but he's over in Switzerland, spending a lot of time over there, so he's not available. But he's a good man. He's got some of the richest uranium specimens I ever saw down there in his office. And he got fed up, he had a place out in California there at Saratoga on

the peninsula south outside of San Francisco, where he had--that damn dog belongs to my second wife's son who is on the way to Vietnam the second time. He was over there for six months and is being sent back. He's been down in Carolina and is resting here before he goes over there--his wife and youngster and brought his dog with him and that damn dog has been corraled out there. And that's the noise you hear. That's not normal around here for the course. There's been quite a few things. There's still some scintillators and geiger counters that I still have.
RG: Well, I don't believe I have any other questions to ask you right now. Is there anything else you'd like to add?
RP: No, it's top bad that I didn't keep a day-to-day diary of what was going on, but, as I say, I think the program, number one, was a sound program, and, number two, I think that, I mean in the incentives they gave for the first twenty thousand pounds of uranium content, I didn't find any dishonesty in the AEC in any of the areas. I do know Union Carbide and Climax and Vanadium Corporation had lobbies in
Washington and that they wielded some influence. But I could never, I was looking for it, see. I was looking for it among the personnel, and I think it's,
34

 ROBERTS. PALMER
I found this to be true, in government service in this country as compared with Canada, a Canadian bureaucrat or government official is generally a man who has a career. That's a career for him, see. But most of these bastards--pardon the expression--are
looking for a job after they get out of government service. Consequently they are very nice to big interests and I kept a, I'm the one that, you probably know, has been a 1ittle active in some of the lousy deals that are going on---?---. I have a couple of lawyers in the interior department that were transferred out of their offices in, here in Denver. I didn't think this was possible. I didn't think that when you were a government servant, and you were rendering sincere service to your government, that some influence some place could be exerted on the secretary of the interior to the extent of having you transferred into another area where you don't know a damn thing about it. One of these fellows is in Oregon, and he's one of the top experts in the country on public lands and how to protect the government's interests from the inroads of the man who is now the secretary of the interior and his group. But anyhow that's a different story, and I've seen all that sort of thing, and I'm very
35

 ROBERTS. PALMER
much against it and may explode a few bombs in the near future. I'm not sure. I'm thinking of it. I'm quite unhappy at the treatment I've gotten recently. Although the $187 a month won't make it for me one way or the other. But after firm agreement with roe in the association they have now, the big companies have now taken over the Colorado Mining A ssociation entirely and are operating it to their satisfaction. I might show you this little plaque before you leave. It's out in the other room, and I'll show you I'm not kidding you.
RG: Okay, thank you very much for the interview. [END OF TAPE]
