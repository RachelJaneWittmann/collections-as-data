 THE FOLLOWING I S AN INTER VIEW WITH NA THAN B . KNIGHT , J R . CONDUCTED BY SUZANNE SIMON FOR THE URANIUM ORAL HISTORY P R O J E C T . THE INTER VIEW WAS CONDUCTED ON AUGUST 1 0 , 1 9 7 0 I N MOAB, UTAH.
SS:
NK:
Well, Mr. knight maybe you'd start by telling me something about your early years, your background, how you came to be in this area and so forth.
I was born and raised here in the Moab area. My dad came to this country I guess in about 1910 or shortly thereafter and he's been in the mining business of one kind or another ever since. Uranium will never lose a market for it. So I think I was born, and at least when I was a year old why we was up back of La Sal Junction at a .uranium mine at that time.
Your family lived there?
My dad was mining there and my mother was living there at the mine too. So I was born and raised right in the middle of it and I pretty well know all the country around here as far as that goes you know.
May I ask what year you were born?
1920.
1920. Your father in 1921 then was already interested in
SS: NK:
SS: NK: SS:
uranium, huh?
NK: Yes. He had been mining some for several years before
that. I think the first job he had when he came to this country was over at Monogram Mines just out of Bedrock, Colorado between Bedrock and Naturita there on the south side of Paradox Valley. I think he worked for it seems

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
like the old Standard Uranium Company. You probably heard that name.
SS: Uh huh. Standard Chemical.
NK: Standard Chemical. That was the first job he had around
this country over there and then he come on over to Moab
after that.
SS: Had he mined before he came to this area?
NK: No. He's from Kansas originally and then Rock Port and
around the Rocky Port area in Colorado working on farms, and I guess he didn't like the prairies and the wind and the hail storms so he decided to leave there.
SS: He was there mining off and on all the time that you were growing up?
NK: Yeah. If it wasn't uranium or vanadium it was coal or placer mining or some type of mining practically all the time. Years when there wasn't any mining due out in the coal mines or anything why he worked the farms for a few years but most of the time it's been mining.
SS: And so I guess you had an interest in it from the time you--?
NK: Remember it.
SS: Y eah.
NK: I was working in the, helping him in the coal mine and I
still before I was ten years old even driving the burro pulling the coal out of a little coal mine we had out
2

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT here.
SS: Well, your father did do quite a bit of prospecting didn't he?
NK: Yes, he's been over this whole area prospecting for uranium. We looked for fluorspar mines over here, prospected for copper. I guess anything that was, worked up on the mesa on some of this gold property that's up on the Wilson Mesa up here. Anything in the mining line why he was interested in.
SS: When you were a boy did you go out prospecting with him? NK: Oh yeah. Like I say when we weren't mining, we spent a lot of the summers even then out prospecting, placer mine, doing something like that. During the years he was coal mining why summertime was slack so we'd go out prospecting and placer mining and do anything you could think of, peddle vegetable to make a living during the
summer.
ss: Well, maybe I should go along then, and did you go
through the schools here in this area in Moab?
NK: Yeah. I graduated Grand County High School and started to go to Mesa County Junior College over in Grand Junction-- went to one quarter and quit. Too lazy I guess to
continue.
ss: I can't believe laziness would enter into it--somebody
that gets out and mines and hikes these hillsides. 3

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
NK: I guess I just didn't like school.
SS: Then when you gave up school and I guess you did, did you
go right into mining or did you try something else.
NK: I got a job mining. You've probably heard of Kunkle- Dunsen Vanadium Mining out in Dry Valley the summer of '39. They had some property leased from--Howard was
controlling the property out in Dry Valley at that time. There was this Kunkle outfit and small vanadium processing mill out there and it was actually the first uranium mining job I had was out there at the mines there at Water Hole group and Cave-In out there in Dry Valley.
SS: Actually I don't know very much about the Dry Valley area. Is that Morrison formation out there?
NK: Yes, that's the Morrison formation.
SS: And you were--did they process for the uranium at all
then or were they just after vanadium?
NK: They were just processing vanadium at that time. Wasn't
any to sell at that time for uranium at all unless it was good high grade. Howard Balsley was buying high grade. Had to run at least one and a half percent. Dry Valley ore's are all pretty good vanadium but very little uranium. Most of it's just a trace and that's all.
ss: And what kind of ore bodies do you find out there? Well, what I'm most familiar with and what I talk most about is the Shinarump formations where you've got the channels
4

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
that follow the old stream beds but I don't know too much about how the ore occurs in the Morrison. Can you--?
NK: Actually it more or less occurs in the Morrison in the same fashion as it does in the Shinarump. You've got your more or less channels, log jams and some places why you've just got a replacement of your carnotite ores replacing your wood in your logs, some of your logs that they've mined out around this country in the Morrison you can practically see the rings in the trees and in the bark and everything else in the tree but it's all been replaced by--some of it with real high grade carnotite ore. But the clays and the log jams you have to have these traps and everything to hold the solution there long enough to have settled out before he has an ore deposit; so you've actually got the same thing happening in the Morrison as you do in the Shinarump. It's slightly different but actually not too much. It's the difference in the formations but the process is the same actually that had to trap several solutions out.
SS: Can you describe what kind of equipment you used and actually how you did the mining? Would you say this was about '39?
NK: '39 was the year I was mining out in Dry Valley for Kunkles. We used reel balls and single jacks and hand steel and we didn't like drill as slow as it was of hand
5

 NATHAN B. KNIGHT
steel so we found an old coal mining auger and used that on some of the softer places where we could auger that. They use to drill holes in coal and we used it to speed things up a little bit. We had hand steel and double jacks and single jacks which was a hard way to mine--hand steel--I'll tell you for sure.
ss: So now when you say hand steel, you mean literally driving it by hand with a hammer?
NK: You just have a piece of steel and hold it with one hand and hit it with a hammer with the other and after each lick with the hammer why you have to pull that steel back out of the, off the bottom of the hole and turn it just a little bit and then when you hit it again why that chips off some ore there at the bottom and lift it up a little bit more and hit it with the hammer and it chips off a little bit more, keeps that steel turning round and round as you hit it with the hammer. The same way with the jack hammer only an awful lot slower.
SS: Yeah, let's see. Well, that was your first mining job after you finished school. How long were you out there?
NK: Oh, we were just out there for one summer was all. We looked for a job and didn't have much--stay with anything. Got a job working on a railroad for a while that fall over tearing up the railroad out at Mack, Colorado. Quit it and came back and had a lease from
6

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
Howard Balsely on the Vanadium Queen over on the Sail Creek. I was mining vanadium and hauling it into Uravan at that t i me. That lasted between--I was mining with Murphy Brothers part of the t ime . Part of the time I was
SS: NK:
SS: NK:
SS:
NK:
on my own from then until I went in the Army in 1941. You mean you were contacti ng leases yoursel f?
Leasing and then hauling the ore to Uravan. Part of the time I mined it myself and part of the time I hired somebody to do the mining--buying the ore from them and hauling it to Uravan and--
And did you have your own truck for hauling?
Yeah. I was in with Murphy Brothers part of the time and then I had my own truck later on.
Did you have to pay all your costs for hauling in those early, say before Metals Reserve contract?
Yeah. At that time when they first started over there just paid thirty-one cents a pound for vanadium. That was about--you paid your own freighting into the mill and everything. You just got thirty-one cents a pound no
matter how far you hauled it or--
Then you were in the service you say?
Yeah, until the 21st of December in '45 so I took a three and a half year vacation away from the mining business.
SS: NK:
SS: Where were you during most of the war?
NK: I was in Australia and New Guinea and up in the
7

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
Philippines and was in the Philippines when the war ended.
SS: Well, after you got your vacation over with there did you come back to this area right away?
NK: Yeah. During the war my dad started up a little coal mine out in Crescent Canyon just above Crescent Junction and I helped him in the coal mine in '46 and hauled some lumber that summer and ran the mine again in '47. In '48 I opened up the Fluorspar Mine over in Glade Park area between the Dolores and Colorado.
SS: Can you kind of give me an idea of how the different mining processes differ? I mean do you mine coal a great deal differently that you mine vanadium or uranium?
NK: Oh, yeah. Coal mine is usually in a fairly even blanket vein. You just go in and you know how much you've got all the time. In most of your uranium and vanadium mines why you' 11 have a channel and you' 11 have ore in it for awhile and then you'11 be on ore for awhile and then you'll have to drift awhile and back on ore where your coal mine is all just blanket vein. You know what you've got every day
SS: And how about the mining conditions. Do you consider it more hazardous or more unpleasant to mine coal then uranium or vanadium for instance, the type of strata you have to deal with and--?
8

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
NK: The small coal mine, I like them better than I do the
uranium-vanadium mines. I never did work in a big coal mine where they opened up so much country and had so much trouble with gas and all that which we never did have, but your uranium mines why they try to get all the ore and they open up such big holes in places that it gets pretty dangerous at times getting it out. Trying to clean out a whole channel, you know, without leaving any of it. And the way that it's laid in there why it's hard to do that without it getting dangerous. As far as your radiation and any of those parts are concerned to prove it's supposedly bad for you I can't see where it's ever hurt me any. It may have done but I stayed with it long enough I guess but I mined some pretty high grade ore and never did hurt me any that I know of except maybe one time. I had a bunch of high grade--saving it and had it under my bed and oh, about probably maybe nine hundred pound bed, I mean ore in powder boxes, you know, and I'd just push them under my bed and I started getting so I don't recognize people where my back is weak and couldn't straighten back up and I couldn't figure out what the heck was wrong with me and I knew there wasn't anything wrong with my back as far as hurting it or anything, you know. I got to wondering if maybe with increased circulation and everything if that uranium under my bed
9

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
was having anything to do with it as long as in the middle of the winter up on Polar Mesa really gets cold up there. I finally decided one day I'd move that stuff out
SS:
NK: SS:
NK:
SS:
NK:
of there and crawled in bed that night after moving the uranium out and almost froze to death. It made that much difference just the bombardment of the uranium on my body I guess and my circulation that much. After about a week why I went back to the field, back cured itself right up. No wonder I don't work--
You had that nine hundred pounds. What do you figure that stuff would assay for?
It probably would run seven or eight percent uranium. Pretty hot rocks. Well, let's see, we had kind of followed your progress in mining through the fluorspar mines.
Up on Polar was my next place after the first one mine in '49 and then I mined for U.S. vanadium. I leased from
them up on Polar Mesa.
And that was vanadium and uranium over there the carnotite stuff?
Yes, and they were paying for both at that time. I just mined up there a year and then went from there out to Temple Mountain. You've heard of it. I mined out there for about a year. That's in the Shinarump formation out thereo
10

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
SS: Did you work a lease out there?
NK: Yeah, I was leasing. I can't think of the name of that
outfit. I can't remember the name.
SS: Well, maybe it will come to you.
NK: Mineral Engineers took the lease over. That's when I quit
when the Mineral Engineers took over, but I can't remember the outfit I had the lease from. And from then I went back over there to Paradox and mined at Radium Cycle over there just upon the rim above Paradox. Morrison formation and some real high grade carnotite ore came out of the Radium Cycle. A high grade carnotite. It was a good mine. It had quite a lot of vanadium and low grade chips afterwards. Originally it was a high grade uranium mine. That's what it started out being. And about 1951, 1952 I built a road down into Taylor Canyon from down the other side of the neck out here. It's between the Green and the Colorado. It's the first road off into any of that country down there. You couldn't hardly call it a road. It's so steep you couldn't. Anyway we got our machinery and stuff up and down there and brought out about some hundred and some odd ton of ore.
SS: Did you have to construct some road and then did you have to do some mining in there after you got the road built.
NK: Yes. After the mine pinched out and we got the road down in there too why we finished paying for the cat I bought
11

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
to build the road down in there and had to take a job with a cat van so I built the road off of the neck out there--the Shafer Trail--I don't know whether you've heard of it.
No, I don't know that area.
And built a road off down in there for a bunch of
SS: NK:
ss: NK:
ss:
NK:
different miners and companies got together and wanted a road down there so Mick Murphy and I got together and built the road off of there. People didn't think that it was possible and I'm not sure it was but we got one down there anyway.
Well, did you have to do much blasting to get a road in? Oh yeah. We had to blast ledges, as high as fifty foot ledges and build a road from down these solid ledges to get down off of part of it.
I guess your experience as a miner was pretty valuable in trying to build roads through the country.
Oh yeah. We had to know all about powder and drilling holes, compressors and different kind of hammers and everything that built roads just as well as mining. And after I built a road off the Shafer Trail why I built another one for some Salt Lake mining company over--you go down through Robber's Roost and down into the Laterite Basin. Standing Up Basin is right next to Laterite Basin and it's part of the new park, you know. It's on the west
12

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
side of the Green River, just above the confluence--built a road off into there in 1953. Then in 1954 I formed a uranium company and had some property over on La Sal Creek and Carpenter Ridge.
SS: You formed a stock company? Who went into that with you? NK: Well, just my partner and I, Norman Heffman and the main people that bought the stock, well, Ed Hoight was the main one out of San Francisco and he sold stock to a lot of his rich friends in San Francisco. He only sold forty- five thousand dollar issues so Class A issues. He didn't have to go through all the red tape going through the SEC. We just sold small issues. We probably didn't make all the reserve extra money we should have had. And time when we did run out of money uranium stock wasn't selling too good by that time so we didn't go on to sell any big
issue of stock to do anything with.
SS: Well, had you prospected the claims that went into the
NK:
company?
I had staked some of them and had some of them in La Sal Creek joining very good property over there. Just didn't
happen to turn out to be any good. And this Ed Hoight that I mentioned, he had a bunch of oil leases out on the Big Flat and all through that area and we staked a bunch of property down in Taylor Canyon and around in there. We then staked--this was about the time they came out with
13

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
this oil and gas lease step on your uranium properties. Can't remember that bill was--583 or something like that anyway. Everybody thought that if you needed to stake claims on the oil and gas leases you owned and vice versa, you needed to get the gas and oil and leases on uranium property. They finally came out with the multiple-use bill and cleared all that up but anyway we
staked all the ground down in Mineral Canyon or T~ylor Canyon area we had or at least the ground we thought might be any good when we had the oil and gas leases on it.
ss: Did any of those in that area prove to be real valuable?
NK:
No. The claim that we built the road down there to start mining on didn't have any drilling actually where it was at until we built the road down there. We got a hundred and it was slightly over a hundred ton of forty-four hundredths ore and practically shoveled it up over the surface down there. When we hit the hard surface, the face of the ledge, it started to go in, why there was no more there. We drilled around there and prospected every place else and that was just all there was. There wasn't any more. It's hard to believe. It just got back to where it started getting good you'd think and that was all there was.
SS: Kind of a thing about the way this uranium business is. 14

 NATHAN B . KNIGHT
NK: The place it was at practically no way you could have
SS:
NK: SS:
KN:
prospect ed , I mean outside of you could see what was there to start with. There was no way to check it out unti l you got a road and some machinery down there and so that's all expens i ve bui l ding the road down there to get it out and we got a hundred, a little over a hundred ton of it.
Was there enough ore and was it good enough to pay your expense for the road?
Well, hardly.
How many miles of road had you built in there, do you remember?
About twelve miles I think. It was fairly easy but part of it was just like building down off of that hillside over there. Only a lot higher hill. I think we started in January or February. Started building that road down there and it was June I think we finally got to the mine and by the end of June we had it all mined out. We were back out of it.
So that the company you formed there didn't go on too good?
No. We ran out of capital too quick. And aft er that why I started back on my own again and took a lease from Lakeside Monarch which Jack Turner was president of at
the time down in Red Canyon. Allan Number Two is the name 15
SS:
NK:

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
of the property right next to the Radium King Mine.
SS: Allan Number Two Mine did you say?
NK: Uh huh. The mine that the Radium King Mine got all there
several million dollars worth of ore out of it. They had been a hole or two drilled but they weren't sure whether it was good enough to even mine until the Lakeside Monarch went in and drilled a few holes. They couldn't tell for sure just what the channel was doing or anything there, or on the incline down to the property. And this bunch of holes mined it out and this big Radium King channel. They got I don't know how many millions of dollars worth of ore they took out of there. Just cut across the corner of Allan Number Two Mine, a chunk of
channel there about possibly three hundred feet long by on the wide end a hundred foot tapering down into nothing on the narrow end. That's all the channel that cut across the Allan Number Two. And after I ran that incline down there and started mining that why the general manager of Radium King naturally was down there every day to see what it looked like. They hired up and got a drill down there to finish drilling out there around there and the incline a few months later and mined out this big deposit of Radium King's down there. I had just one little stinking corner of one claim on it. There I was down at the Happy Jack last week and Atlas is getting ready to
16

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
have the people that are down there mining the Happy Jack to run an incline. I guess it's way back near where--to connect near where the end of the channel or the end of the shaft is now. I don't mean shaft but mine.
My mining terms aren't too good, but the hole back there
SS:
NK:
gave them some ventilation back in there. They were talking about what stinky job it was to put in a drift through that clay, that Chinle clay. Did you have any trouble with your incline?
Yeah. We had to timber it all the way down. It's not too bad if you're careful but if you don't keep your timber right up with you and just really watch it, why it can start getting away from you, just keeps caving until you- -there's no controlling it. The hole just keeps getting bigger and bigger. And even if it's timbered solid down below why stuff coming in on your timber finally gets so heavy it'll just crush your timber. I've done some mining down just around the hill from the Happy Jack, the one just around to the east would be about a half a mile from the hole. You go into the hole at the Happy Jack. Just go around the point. And I ran that mine for a little while.
SS: What was the name of that one?
NK: I was leasing it from the White Canyon Mining Company and
I can't think of what the name of the company was. D and Dor something. On around from that was Sunrise.
17

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
SS: NK:
SS: NK: SS:
NK:
Yeah. I went in the Sunrise.
Fletch Bronson owned it and his son-in-laws mined it, or his son and son-in-laws.
And I think the Gismo is up there isn't it?
Gismo's up by the Radium King.
Yeah, yeah, that's right. There's a lot of or seems like a lot to me going out there for the first time and seeing all of them at once.
Yeah. It would be hard to get them all straight, although the Radium King's the furthest one down on that road you take from the Fry Canyon store. There's the D and D and the Gismo and I can't think of the one incline area in between the Gismo and the Spook. The Spook was the next one up and then the Maybe. Then over the hill from the Maybe and it's been so darn long since I've been down there and around even any mining, but I've got a lot of this stuff myself.
Yeah. That's awfully impressive country down there. Yeah, a lot of it too.
Well, I guess you mined out that pocket, that corner that
SS: NK: SS:
you had--
NK: Yeah. The Allan Number Two and that time I went in with
Fred Frazier and had the Troll Valley Mining Company. Just him and I owned the company and owned the stock and machinery and everything. We just owned it ourselves. It
18

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
wasn't a stock company or anything.
SS: NK:
A partnership.
It was a corporation only just a few of us owned it and at that time we mined a little bit here and there. We had property up here on Wilson Mesa and we--M. B. and H. L. Hunt pulled out and leased us all their property and just turned it over to us. We'd look it over and whatever we wanted why we'd keep and whatever we didn't why just turned loose and forgot about. And we mined some, over on Blue Mesa, that's down the river from Uravan and up on the Mesa there. We mined there and we had another one over at Slick Rock we mined out. Then we took a lease on Blue Lizard down below the Radium King Mine.
And did Preston Redd own it at that time?
Well, he--
Or his company?
He sold it to a company but he still hadn't been paid off completely. He was getting royalty off of it so you might say he owned it and we mined, that's where I broke my neck was down at that mine. That was the end of my mining career.
SS: NK: SS: NK:
SS: Would you mind talking about your accident?
NK: It don't bother me. What do you want to know about it? ss: How did it happen?
NK: I was just on a tractor going into the mine and it was a
19

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
fairly low spot there but plenty of room to go through and I was leaning over this one armrest and tractor just stayed as low as possible but I don't know whether a rock had fallen out of the side of the tunnel--had fallen off from the car or mucking it that came out last or what, but as near as I can tell the tractor must have run over the rock and when the rock tipped over why it wasn't high enough and it caught my right shoulder on the roof and naturally I couldn't stop the tractor in time and pulled this shoulder back and rolled me over in the seat and when pressure got so much I just passed out. I don't know what happened to my neck but must have caught on something on the side of the tunnel and when I woke up why it was just two or three seconds or a half minute later or something like that. It wasn't very long, you know, but I couldn't move. That all there was to it. It didn't hurt or anything hardly. I mean it was hurting when I passed out but when I come to there wasn't even any pain and pumped my neck and pressed the spinal column and I haven't been able to move since. That's all there
was to it.
SS: Well, how did you or anybody else in there get out to
medical help? It's so far back in there.
NK: Well, I flew down there all the time. I mean there was an
airstrip right next to it and taught my brother-in-law, 20

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
and both my brother-in-laws worked for me most of the time and both of them had learned how to fly and they got me off the tractor. The tractor was a hydromatic tractor. Naturally I pulled my foot off of the throttle and everything and it just come to a halt about ten or twelve feet on down the tunnel there. After that there was little up grade that started right there and it just run the wheel up to that--or tracks--and stopped. It's still pretty crowded quarters and quite a time to get me off of that onto a door and packed me out, hauled me down to the airstrip and my brother-in-law flew me into town. I was--
oh, this happened right after noon probably quarter after one or something at the latest, and I was in Salt Lake LDS hospital after stopping and having some x-rays in this hospital. I was in Salt Lake Before six o'clock that evening. So they didn't have any trouble getting me out of there really.
SS: When you were working down in that area did you live at the mines during the week or--?
NK: Yeah. In fact we'd stay down there for--we'd go down on Monday and work Tuesday through to the following week from Thursday. I mean they'd work ten days straight and then come out and have four days civilization and then go back down for ten days. If you tried to come in every
weekend why you spend all your time on the road. So we 21

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
would stay ten days and have a four day weekend every two weeks.
SS: Did you take your family with you or did they stay in Moab?
NK: When I was down there they didn't. I had a kid in school and most of the time it was too hot down there in the summertime and I didn't stay down there all the time. I had a crew there and part of the time I had a crew over in Slick Rock. I had another crew over by the Happy Jack part of the time and another one out in Cottonwood above the Dugout Ranch, and drill working here and there and I'd fly down there and maybe stay for two or three days and sometime's I'd stay for two weeks. The day I got hurt why we were, oh, I think a week or so before my tractor operator quit and I was more or less breaking in a new one and he was kind of slow. I was in a hurry on this one day to get another load out before my brother got there to haul it. That's when the accident happened. I think I was in a little bit of a hurry anyway. And ordinarily I wouldn't even had been driving the tractor. But all these circumstances happened at the time I was--.
SS: Was this a diesel driven motor or--?
NK: Yeah, diesel front end loader. Scrubber diesel on the
back to clean up the air.
SS: Well, you were in the industry for such an interesting
22

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
period from your father's interest until very early and on through. What were the best years for hard rock miners? Was it under Metals Reserve when Metals Reserve was buying ore or under the AEC policies or just what were the best times?
NK: Oh, I think most of the miners around here have done better during the years that the AEC was buying the ore from oh, I'd say probably 1950 when they raised the price a little bit--'50 or '51 put that bonus on and everything then through 1 60 was the best ten years around here for most miners.
SS: And how about the AEC? In your various operations all around, were they a great help to you? Did their exploratory drilling help you particularly or--?
NK: Well, they didn't really help me I wouldn't say. But some people it did I know. I didn't get in on anything they drilled out or anything of that sort. And I was on good terms, got along real well with them. Helped them out. Helped their geologists out plotting a lot of the country where I was working at the time telling them everything I knew. Let's say I helped them more than they helped me.
ss: I got quite a variety of answers to that question. I imagine you can guess that.
NK: I would imagine. Some guys got a lot of benefit out of it. They practically drilled out their property for them.
23

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
A man who lived up in Monticello owned Western Mines, the biggest part of that. Maybe Mine was drilled out by the AEC. These are the instances I know of. Some of the people that got leases from the ground that the AEC drilled out and owned and leased out, you know. Jack Turner got an AEC lease and did all right with it. A. C. Turner and his brother got an AEC lease and done pretty well. Different guys around here really benefited, made
some money off of the AEC's programs, but a lot of us who I guess--some of the roads the AEC helped build like down to the Radium King, most of that was done by the AEC or got to haul ore over the roads that they built.
SS: Now, you had operations all over during the boom years didn't you? But just thinking about that White Canyon-Red Canyon area, when you took the lease on the Blue Lizard were there a lot of big mining camps down in that area?
NK: Well, you might say there was down there quite steadily from 1955-60 when I got hurt, there was Radium King-- called the minerals camp--and Fry Canyon and Spook and
Gismo and Maybe Mine was owned by McFarlane Hollinger. They had a pretty good camp there. A good share of the people there though lived at Fry Canyon Store Trailer Camp and drove over to the Maybe Mine which wasn't too far and your Deer Flat, White Canyon area, Shumways over in that area. They had some pretty good camps over in

there. You had to have camps down in that country. It was too far to commute to anyplace.
Did you get in on many of the entertainment, the parties and the different things that they did? Entertainment and
SS:
NK:
that sort of thing.
No. I knew that they got a little partying around Fry Canyon store down there a few of them but I never was there. Like I say, I started flying right after I went down there. I decided that was the only way to go to that part of the world. When I wanted to party I'd come to Moab. It didn't take very long to fly home from down there--forty-five minutes is all it took which lots of people commute longer than that to get some place.
Yeah. Was there an airstrip down close in Red Canyon close to the mine?
There was one that was about a quarter mile over to the one by the Allan Number Two and then I built one about a quarter of a mile from camp there at Blue Lizard. So it didn't take long to get from the mine to the airstrip. If you decided to walk it only took a few minutes.
Yeah. Well, that sure beats the heck out of driving out there I'm sure.
I'll say. A lot cheaper too. It cost from here down there in the pickup, I could make it down there on oh, fifteen,
sixteen gallons of gas driving. About half the time I'd 25

have a broken spring and flat tire before I got there and the same thing coming back. I could go down and back on ten gallon of gas in the airplane and never did have a
flat tire or broken spring on it.
SS: Oh. Did you have any trouble in the summertime with air
currents and--?
NK: No. It was a little bit rough riding once in a while and
all the years I flew down there never a day come that I wanted to go why I jumped up and go and I think once I wasn't able to make it down there for the storm and one time I got down to the airstrip and it was just too windy. I didn't dare land. I flew up to Red House to a bigger strip and landed there and waited for about an hour and a half until the front kind of went by and then fly back there and landed and everything was all right, but out of about four years of flying in and out of there practically, well, anytime I wanted to why all the time I couldn't make it where I was going and landing.
ss: Well, from what I hear people were stranded with snow and flash floods and everything else trying to drive.
NK: Trying to drive, yeah. But I had a lot less trouble than they did I'll tell you.
SS: Were there many people using airplanes to come in and ' out, I mean mine owners and--?
NK: Oh, yeah. They were used quite a bit down in that area.

Radium King had a plane that they were flying in and out of there steadily all the time. Their office is up in Salt Lake and t hey brought in most of their main bosses

in and out all the time instead of making them bother to drive in. Just too much wasted time actually to drive down into that country . J oe Cooper had a plane way early that he flew in and out of the Happy Jack with. I suppose you saw that airstrip that's right on the road just below the--
They told me where the airstrip was. It didn't look like much of an airstrip to me but I guess it was.
Well, it was a good one compared to most of the ones I landed at.
Well, I'll tell you they're paving another thirteen or fifteen mile stretch of road. Well, back toward Blanding from the Happy--well, Fry Canyon. I guess they've been hauling a lot of equipment and materials for this road in and out there. I don't know how many big old chuckholes I fell in. Just full of dust, you know, and you can't see them until you're in them.
I know. Their share of deep ruts.
Yeah. I got quite shaken up driving in there.
You know what I mean when I say you can wind up with a flat tire and broken spring before you get there.
I'll tell you I've been over there three times.

NK: That's why I didn't like to drive down there and you have
a quarter inch of dust on your face. In the summertime especially as hot as it is and perspiring like you do and then the dust settling on you. You can't find yourself after you get there.
ss: You look like another one of the red men. [laughter]
NK: Sure do.
ss: I was going to ask you, you did quite a bit of road
construction. How did you like that compared with mining?
Did you like it better or--?
NK: No. When I'd get too poor mining I'd do a little road
building or cat skinning to get on my feet again so I could go back to mining. You know how the mining business is--
[END OF SIDE ONE]
NK: --rich for a few days and then you're broke for quite a
few more. And that's a pretty good way to make money on the side when you need it. Of course you usually need a cat and stuff around the mines anyway so we kept one around most of the time.
SS: Yeah. I imagine especially in those years say from '50- ,60 there was quite a demand to a cat experienced
operator.
NK: You could keep on just as busy as you wanted to then. I
didn't stay in the business any more than I had to. 28

Whenever I could mine, why I would mine.
SS: Well, let me see. I was going to ask you if you could think of any mine or any area where you had a particularly rough problem working out your operation?
NK: Not that I know of. Several of them I had trouble finding any ore. That's the big problem all over I think. That's nothing unusual about that. Can't all be as lucky as Charlie was.
SS: No, I guess not. It would be kind of nice I think.
NK:
Yeah. A brother-in-law and another guy and I mined a few loads out to the Big Indian area. It was in 1948 and there was some showings on the rim about due east of the Homestake shaft out there in the Big Indian district. And some of Cutler had some specks of uranium in it. And the Big Buck mine is on down below there. Standard Uranium had or bought from, oh, Hayes and Donald Adams. They were in that same Cutler formation. When they finally discovered this on back several hundred feet--in fact about a half mile back in the rim back there where we were mining it out there. Of course we didn't have only just a compressor and a jack hammer and a shovel and cut the hole in the ore in the mill there. We were sure wishing we had some way of drilling some holes back of that rim there to see if we couldn't find what happened
back behind there, but we just didn't have it you know. 29

 NA THAN B . KNIGHT
That was back in 1 48 about four years before Steen ever sunk a hole back there. If we'd got smart and staked claims back there we'd probably got them before somebody

SS: NK:
found the ore. Because we didn't have the money to develop them you know.
That was before AEC was doing anything.
Yeah. The AEC wasn't doing anything. In that area there wasn't even looking at it.
Well, it was a--
Been pretty close to some pretty good ore bodies but just never quite made the grade. Just cut the edges of them. That seems to be a hazard in the uranium business. That's the way some people do it.
SS:
NK:
SS: Well, is there anything else you'd like to add now?
NK: Not that I know of. I don't know what I've told you that
w ill do you any good.
SS: Oh, this has been just real interesting and I thank you
so much for your taking the time to talk to me. NK: I've got lots of that.
SS: Okay, thank you.
