 THE FOLLOWING I S AN INTERVIEW WITH RAYMOND SULLIV AN CONDUCTED BY CLARE ENGLE AT GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO ON JUL Y 2 4 , 1 9 7 0 [FOR THE UTAH URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT TAPE #1].
CE: Thank you very much, Mr. Sullivan, for inviting me to your office this morning and allowing me to question you about your relation with Union Carbide Corporation. As you know, that's the study we are doing in regard to the uranium industry in this area. Before we begin that however, would you like to tell me about when you were born and where you were raised and educated?
RS: Well, Mrs. Engle, I have been connected with the uranium business since about 1945. I was born in Chicago in 1911 and attended schools north of Chicago in a little town called Wilmette, Illinois. I went to high school in a place called Nutria High School and Northwestern University, where I graduated with the degree of Natural Science and Geology in 1932, and got my Master's degree in 1933. I've been in the mining business ever since 1933. Initially I was connected with gold mining and Cripple Creek, Colorado, and areas of Wyoming up in the Bighorn
Mountains and the Gold Springs areas; north of Boise, Idaho, called the Idaho Basin; these were principally all g~ld ---?--- places. Subsequently I became connected with the--as a mining engineer and later as

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
a superintendent of a mine in Central City, Colorado; it was called the United Gilton Corporation and was a successor to the old Cheena Mine which was famous during that time. Later I moved to run a mine outside of Boulder, Colorado, at Lefthand Canyon. It's an area that's all underground gold mining and was quite rich in gold. This operation was closed down prior to the advent of W.W. II; that the famous order that was put out by the president in those days that they called L-208 shut down all the gold mines in the United States and used the mining labor elsewhere, where it was needed more by the country. We stayed in Boulder, Colorado, and started up and ran a tungsten mill utilizing several of the old dumps and refuse piles that were left from early operations around the turn of the century and also operated eleven mines there. This came to an end early on, about when the war was halfway over and I was contacted by Union Carbide people at that time. At that time it was known as U.S. Vanadium Company. They needed crews of
miners to develop and mine the large vanadium mine
north of---?---, Colorado.
CE: This was during the metals Reserve Period between---
?--- and---?--- approximately?
RS: Yes, and this mine had been developed on the upper
2

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
level. It was mined extensively and was one of the principal sources of vanadium for the war effort. But the lower regions of the ore body had to be reached though a lower additive; this was what job I had. I took a contract and brought my crews over from Boulder county and we drove the tunnels. Attison developed the mine for production. At the same time the mines were being operated by company operators
and company employees.
CE: Go into some detail about the process you used and
the types of equipment you used then, and later in the interview we'll develop the type of equipment you use now.
RS: Well, in essence in those days the tunnel driving was done with--as I recall the addit was about 1,100' long. From the surface we established the level area outside of the addit which consisted of switchyards for tracks for the cars, bin space for bug ore and waste, and the change room facilities other things of physical purposes that are required outside of any mine addit. The equipment that was
used by the crew in those days were what we called drifter drills that drove the steel and bits and had a two machine jumbo. We worked as I recall either two or three shifts; one shift followed another and just
3

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN #1
kept on the cycle of drilling, blasting, ventilation or blowing in or blowing out, tempering the ground support if it were required. This is nominal procedure and still we use today although there may be some different equipment, but the development of new mining techniques was fairly well along at that time because I was--as I recall the Looney Cycle was used in the nyco-muckker which is an air operated machine that had a bucket on the front and loaded the car on back of it. You had to have a switching device so you could get the empty car up to the heading and load it there out of the way. This has been done by most tunnel people by using what we call a California Switch which is a throw-over track. You're able to move the car at right angles off the main line into a little niche which was cut off for that to give it the space for the train to pass it. There are other ways, and that is by Air-tugger device. You can hoist the car up and the train moved underneath it.
CE: A ir-tugger?
RS: The Air-tuggers, yes, which were air hoist. Most of
your machinery underground either operates with electricity or air, and air is the most common means of obtaining power. But this was a good crew and we never--they were very good miners, they were young
4

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
and were able to take the physical---?--- that was required of that type of operation. Mining's a hard job.
Was there any awareness then of the danger of radon daughters?
No. We were fortunate to a subsequent information crew because our crews were mainly in the waste. our
CE:
RS:
CE: RS:
CE: RS:
job was to develop the mine so that it had access to the ore and the cross-cut tunnel that we started from the addit to get into the ore body was all waste. There were no radon daughters and no uranium, no ore in that material. Most of the mine was developed in what they call the Footewall, in waste. Then access was had by swinging out little footers into the ore. All we ever did was drive in all the wastes and drive these fingerdrifts off into the ore.
But there were no air holes or ventilation?
No, we had no connection with the operating mine which was above us and all air ventilation was had from the outside by fans and vent pipe.
Well, did you have fans then?
Oh, we had them. Sure, we couldn't operate without
ventilation, but we had really almost no connection with the operating workings up above. That was created afterwards and usually was created by the
5

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
company miners. So the personal part was that those of use who were inside and in that mine and developed the mine were never very much exposed to radon or the daughters that were developed and which have certainly killed off a lot of people since that day. Prior to that I'd been in tunnel contracting business in Cripple Creek, so the process of driving tunnels was the most danger to us, and we had very good crews. Subsequently, after we finished all this job Carbide prevailed upon us to move the crews and people out to Bishop, California, where we accomplished a similar job in developing lower tunnel levels for Union Carbide on the tungsten property out there.
CE: What were your relations with Union Carbide? How were you treated?
RS: Well, I was treated well. I was a contractor mostly for over a year, and then for a period of time I was Assistant Superintendent at the Rifle mill and plant
under Sandy Sternts. Sandy is not alive now I believe. But that was the old mill site that was east of Rifle which is now covered; it's all grass covered, they've wrecked the plant. It's all covered up, but I was there about a year as Assistant Superintendent, and that was probably my first
6

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
contact with metallurgical treatment of vanadium ore. As---?--- by the old roaster process---?--- and the uranium was just incidental. Although it was saved;
it was called D-metal in those days.
CE: The tailings were saved.
RS: Yes, the tailings were treated. There was a certain
amount of uranium always developed and saved in that process but not very much. As I recall the average ore in the Rifle mine was somewhere less than a tenth of one percent, which would be less than two pounds. I think the average is 1.4 pounds, 1.3 pounds, as I recall. But there had [been] significant--and then later during the Manhattan District days when we were there and this development that--[what] we were connected with was at the time of Manhattan District. We worked out here, knew most of them, but nobody ever referred to the word uranium, it was always D- metal or some other name that they gave it for whatever reason I don't know, but it superceded it.
CE: You weren't aware of the--
RS: Oh, yes I was--
CE: The significance?
RS: I was aware of uranium and the saving of it, I
couldn't help but be. I mean, we just didn't discuss it amongst ourselves or any strangers or anyone else.
7

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
CE:
RS:
How did you become aware that this was something one did not discuss?
We [were] told that by--oh, from Burwell on down that this is something you didn't discuss, and especially
[with] strangers, even though we knew anything. The Manhattan District had plenty of inspectors and supervisors in the area, some of whom we knew and a lot we didn't know.
You think Ed Burwell knew that the uranium was being used for weaponry?
Oh, yes. Or was going to be used--everybody during that time speculated on the use of uranium.
When was this specifically? Can you remember what--? Oh, it would be about '45-46.
Well, of course by now the bomb had been dropped. Well, then prior to that. Prior to the dropping of the bomb. '44, then. Everybody speculated as to what it was, but the Einstein theory of Relativity was understood by us, most of us who were engineers, and we knew what they were trying to develop. Whether they could physically put the pieces together, we--I
had heard about the problems they had at the University of Chicago; I have my friends and relatives and family that live there. Although they don't know what, my friends didn't know what was
CE:
RS:
CE: RS: CE: RS:

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
happening, I could put together by some friends problems and some of the other things you knew. Nobody in those days, at least at our level was aware of the implications of the uranium program; developing the atomic bomb wasn't possible to be
aware. Because they segregated the manufacturing and research and all these other things in various little centers scattered across the country, so unless you were over and above and knew several things you couldn't put them together unless by accident you bumped on to something. As too--and I knew, and by accident some certain time I bumped into a---?--- in Bloomfield, New Jersey, one of Westinghouse's electric plants who were working on tungsten metal power in which I was interested at that time, but in being there for a couple weeks I was accepted as maybe one of the people who belonged there, so I had the freedom of wandering around the plant and times of the boards, so I bumped into how they were making uranium hexachloride. I was told the whole process about the thing, and the problem was that we had to tell this knowledge that we weren't supposed to get to the Manhattan District through their--so, boy,
they closed that source of information up quick.
CE: Why did you have to tell them? How did they know you
9

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1 knew?
RS: CE: RS: CE: RS:
We were under oath to do that.
But how did they know you knew?
We had to tell them if we walked onto it.
Oh.
Otherwise we would have been just as guilty. In other words, if we get hit I didn't want any enemy agent to hear, and the big thing was to keep any information
from the enemy. There was a lot of work out here during those war years days. Oh, the Blueheaded Dimen and Boris Purjel. Did anybody ever tell you about that? W ell, Boris P urjel was one of these international characters who was more than suspected of being an enemy agent. They came in and they tried to tie up several areas of planes in the uranium district south and southwest of here, all of which was subsequently frauded by Union Mines Corporation. Now Union Mines was a mine of Union Carbide and the government.
It was, I believe, brought about as a result of a government request that they do a survey of the uranium industry on the Colorado Plateau.
Well they did, and they were very, very accurate. A lot of their most able and best geologists and engineers [were] working for them.
CE:
RS:
10

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
CE: I have read their reports. The Willard Reports is
what it's called.
RS: Ben Willard, yes. I knew Ben Willard very well. But
they were more than just that; several Union Carbide officials: Dr. W. G. Haldane was a member. He knew the Mines Board. Blair Burwell was, and earlier members, other engineers of the same repute and people connected with Union Carbide. They had access directly to General Gross and his---?--- on people. So that when this threat came in here certain planes in the Gateway area--the other areas that were known to contain high uranium content, content ores, the Purjel group came in here and tried to tie up---?--- the government supplied money through Union Mines and bought these mines, and this is probably part of the properties that the Atomic Energy Commission got as a starter.
CE: Well, this must have been around '43 or '44 because the Union Mines Development Company was organized from about '43 or '45.
That's right, but Purjel's group tried to tie up some of the stuff, and government money was used to
purchase the claims. Then when the Atomic Energy Commission came into being in 19--I believe '48, they course had this nucleus of properties that were given
RS:
11

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1 them.
CE:

RS:
CE:
Did you know anything about the Willard Report being familiar--?
Partly familiar. It wasn't--it was a report that wasn't circulated, obviously.
No, no, I'm sure it wasn't, because we have it on microfilm at the school library, and it's all marked secret. You know of course it isn't any longer, but when it was written--
It was secret; the report was available to me. But I knew of a lot of work contained because--well, I knew the people that did the work.
Well, do you have any idea why they would not, for instance, check the Shinarump formation for uranium? Most of the report dwells on the Morrison formation. Well, Morrison was the most p prolific horizon for production. The Shinarump wasn't known to be a big
producer; it was only an occasional producer.
Except that the Happy Jack had been found by then in the White Canyon area, and Union [Carbide] and Vanadium Corporation of America--
RS: Oh, the Happy Jack hadn't been found in 1 43 or 1 44. I believe it was found subsequent to that time.
CE: I thought it was found in about '39?
RS: Well, maybe it was, but I never was aware of the
12

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN #1 Happy Jack.
CE:
RS: CE:
RS:
What about VCA's mine named #2? That was found, I do know that.
Oh, yes. I do too.
According to the Willard Report VCA wouldn't allow the Union Mines people to enter their property.
Well, I think that's probably true, because you have to understand the rivalry that existed in the earlier days between VCA and u.s.v. This was generated; you'd have to expose some people to both companies and rugged individualists.
Denny V iles.
Denny Viles I know very well, and Burwell. Both able, capable but highly involved people, and they weren't about to give anyone an edge, their competition. Except this was a government directive.
That didn't make a bit of difference to them; they weren't going to let one or the other get an advantage over the other. For instance, that
Monticello plant was a big fight, and then the Durango plants were a big fight. I guess the final solution was that VCA operated Montecello and u.s. Vanadium operated Durango. That's how it finally wound up to be. These were for Metals Reserve during
CE: RS:
CE: RS:
the war years.
13

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
CE: But they had the Metals Reserve information that they
could have relied on too.
RS: Well, the big producer of uranium was the Morrison
formation. You have to understand that the Morrison formation produced all of the uranium, at least for this country, maybe since Madame Curie's time. They had ore that was running, natural ore way up in the 10-20% [range,J uranium logs and thing like this. When I first became interested in uranium business everybody were looking for logs, for high grade. Nobody worried about low grade; the low grade didn't mean it. The low grade wouldn't pay. Out at Gateway your initial areas of--JoDany area, all the Uravan, the Club Camp and all those things were high [grade] uranium [which] contained coated ore and almost--so your ---?--- production was from the Morrison, and that was what they were hitting. There were a lot of things they didn't hit which were subsequently found. You know the Grants area for instance, well, people knew a little bit about it but not much. There's darn little written on it. Wyoming was never suspected. To
my knowledge i t never was.
CE: The Ambrosia Lake area.
RS: Well, that's Grants, that's what I mean. CE: Oh, sorry. O.K.
14

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN #1
RS: Ambrosia Lake and Grants and--in fact all of you
biggest areas weren't even suspected. You could have be geological deduction come into it in subsequent days. I know we so much wanted to get into the Grants area, but we had too many pressing things here and we didn't get there. So people that didn't have things
in the Morrison, they were the ones that found it. They had not ties to the old district. Like Jack Knable and Anaconda. Betty Martini's was an accident, but Anaconda got in there early. Jack Knable was very persistent, a good knowledgeable engineer. Did you ever meet him? Knable. K-n-a--well, I left Rifle I guess in the latter part of '45 and went to Bishop and was there driving tunnel and finished my job there and stayed on as Assistant Superintendent at Bishop. This was the largest tungsten producer in the United States; it still is by far the largest. It belongs to Union Carbide. I had never worked for a large corporation prior to my working for Union Carbide. I always worked for small companies or my own company or for myself, so after working a couple of years for the company I became quite bored with the regimentation that you have to put up with if you--anybody's working for a large corporation, and I disagreed with certain people and I left at the end
15

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
of '47 and came--
CE: Is that when Burwell left approximately?
RS: That was the same time in fact; we both decided to leave the same time. Dr. W.G. Haldane did the same
thing, he was the Vice-President of U.S. Vanadium. You might have heard about this from your---?--- and his son Eddie Haldane. Well, Joe Western was Mine Superintendent for U.S. Vanadium in the Colorado Plateau area. Joe is an old uranium miner that had more experience in his field. Well, he and Denny Viles I would say would be about on a par of knowledge. Oh, they had some similar areas of knowledge there; I'd say if you could put them both together you would have virtually all the old Morrison formation in detailed knowledge. Joe's dead now. But I came back here in Grand Junction and we knew that the uranium had only one way to go and that was to be an industry, so we decided that we'd form some sort of an association. We came back here at the end of January of '48. Four of us we founders of a company we called Minerals Engineering Company.
CE: Name these people.
RS: Joe Western, Doug Burwell, Dr. w. G. Haldane, and
myself. We subsequently--because we needed money, about $100, we raised that sum from ten individuals
16

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN #1
which some of the older Grand Junction families were participants in, such as the Big Skerts interests here and hardware and lumber business. Big Skerts,
and a man by the name of Richard Warren who was an automobile dealer, Chrysler Automobile dealer who during the war was a trucking contractor at Rifle for U.S. Vanadium. And some Provo friends of mine, a steel warehouser by the name of Leon Cane, and a contractor by the name of Bruce Bordon who was the builder for the Merchandise Mart in Chicago. So there were about ten individuals. We formed Minerals Engineering. Our first job we felt would [be to] endeavor to purchase and tie up good basic, significant claims in areas that were known to be productive for vanadium and uranium. That was my job; I was the person that did it because I was least known in this area and it was felt by all the people that did know that maybe an unknown if he was coached right could probably get better deals out of the owners out of their claims. Anyway, we did tie up lots of grounds up in Gateway, the Calamity, and Outlaw areas, and Blue Creek area out west of Cactus Dry Plains, out of Constance, Utah, and then we got under our program of locating ground where we knew there had to be ore, although nobody had found it.
17

 RA YMOND S U L L I V A N # 1
We located hundreds of claims before anybody else did. These in the early part of '48 there wasn't anybody in uranium business; everybody was talking about doing something but nobody was doing anything; we were doing something.
CE: If Burwell knew that this was going to be a going interest, why didn't USV as a division of Union Carbide push through this? They went back to the
vanadium industry as the major--
RS: Well, you've got to understand that there was quite a
large political upheaval in Union Carbide's organization at about that time, '47-48. This is probably the principal reason why Burwell left there. Large corporations have a habit of doing this at various times, and I think the particular group--! don't recall all their names, but there's a man by the name of Remmers who was a--Walter Remmers came from the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh area from the steel industry, Anti-Carbide and came down through their Niagara personnel and he was given authority over Burwell, and this was this was the reason probably why Burwell left. He had made some decisions that
proved to be completely erroneous, the wrong moves. Burwell took issue with him for instance, they sold to he--at that time virtually all of Union Carbide's
18

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
properties were on a block and they were for sale. In fact, Uravan at the time of 147 to '48 was for sale
for $1,000,000.
CE: Of course it was open at the end of '48 and the
beginning of '49.
RS: No, it was shut down. Supposed to be shut down.
Anyway, they weren't producing anything.
CE: I mean, it was reopened then shortly right after.
RS: Yes, but what I'm saying is if anybody had $1,000,000
and knew anything about the uranium business, I'm talking about companies that had money. Now our little company didn't have anything like that, you know, we had $100,000. But we knew if we could raise $1,000,000 we could have gone down and bought---?--- Union Carbide's position out of the uranium field at that time. To demonstrate, he sold a good tungsten mine out of Nevada called the Valerie Mine; he offered to sell all other properties to this man's industry. Well, that's history, but he wasn't a success at selling all their properties. I guess he didn't find a good-sized sufficient buyer. We just got ahead, and then when the Atomic Energy Commission was first created, as it was created earlier in your area--but before it sent out here and set up a--their personnel here, the first man as I recall here, Phil
19

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
Laggie was in charge. Phil was an old Manhattan District [person]. He came from the Island and he had created an organization here that was virtually all Manhattan people. Well, they were busy setting up some kind of program, and there were lots of pros and cons as to what prices they would pay if any and if they would buy ore and how they would buy ore. They
created VCA as a buying agent. As I recall the first offer that VCA had for uranium was twenty cents a pound. Well, I was minded, they didn't get pound one; this might have been a throwback to the days when they were retreating those old tailings and where the cost of the product was virtually nothing
[because it] was on the surface. Just the cost of extracting is more than twenty cents. I know that Carbide was getting $9 a pound for their uranium from [the surface] level those days. That never was published much, but I saw the contract, that's what they were getting. So--
CE: Why would it be different with them?
RS: This is all secret. They went under the cloud of
secrecy as to what they paid everybody. That's typical of any kind of operation. They wouldn't-- nobody had the general information and they kept publishing these circulars from the AEC, and they
20

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
finally got the circuit of five, which created enough interest and the price was high enough so that--
CE: The boom began.
RS: Yeah. The boom began. There was a lot of drilling
done though before that. We were kind at loose ends, he in Grand Junction while we tied up all this property and were doing a lot of looking, locating other claims. There really wasn't much to do because you had no place to mine or sell ore. I mean we had no prices [that were] worthwhile, so all we were doing was sitting on our claims. But about that time the government through the USGA decided to initiate some drilling programs down here, so we got interested. I'd run diamond drills previously and decided to make a bid in some areas that--they were going to build just some areas where our claims were up in Calamity. Some initial--so we put bids in, put bid bonds up and we were successful. We were low bidders and we got diamond drills and we got some of our diamond drillers and some that Blair and Joe
Western knew who were experts in filling this field. There was a man by the name of Jack Elon and he lived over--well, he was living out of Utah at Tooele at the time, working for the government, the Army Depot
21

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
there, but he used to be a driller in this area. He was a foreman for a man by the name of Johnny Johnson. From the nucleus of Jack Elon and his brother-in-law we built the---?--- organization. We drug into the organization--new young competent men, and we bid subsequent jobs and it got to be above our capability to provide equipment and money to run things so we took current venturers in with us and we made a consortment of drillers here. It was the biggest the field has ever seen and stayed on that way. I believe we did at least half the diamond drilling for the combined atomic energy around the USGS programs. Of course it got deeper; first it was a shallow hill. Fifty, sixty foot drilling, and then the holes got 500' and finally they got up before we got out eight, nine hundred, one thousand feet deep.
CE: That's pretty expensive.
RS: That is expensive.
CE: For instance?
RS: Well, depending on how you do it, but the in those
days I think their average was about three and a half, four dollars a foot. So each hole was thirty- five hundred or four thousand dollars, and if you had to get the concentration of holes in order to eliminate an ore body you could [bring] in many
22

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
hundreds of thousands of dollars too. Once you get a smell in a hole then you go to drill it out; you've got to ---?--- back out. And on an eight hundred, thousand foot hole that runs into a lot of money. Shell holes you could put down pretty fast. In the
early days diamond drills used to accomplish about thirty to forty to sixty feet a shift. Well, obviously this being the greatest concentration of drilling probably the company's ever seen it led to the development of new machines, techniques--bits, tools, drills, everything. The early drills were all skidmired and you had to pull them along and lower them over the hole and tie them down to the ground so they wouldn't raise up off the hole. Well, we went out and bought halftracks for instance, they were surplus in Tooele. We bought two, three hundred halftracks and we wanted drills, we wanted water tanks, we wanted everything on these halftracks. They said they could get around the country 'cause---?---
We established camps and we had groups of drills, usually three to eight drills per group, which meant an average of three men to a drill. That's a driller and a helper and tidier--supplier, water wagon, water trucks, whatever. And if you had a camp you had to make a facilities for eating, sanitary facilities and
23

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
tents and boarding and sleeping and all this stuff. You had to have cooks and everything. That went along with it. Well, anyway, that was a supply train to get there; these camps had to be kept--not only your drilling supplies, but food and mail and everything else that went along.
CE: When did you start getting into the Shinarump formation?
RS: Well, we had contracts that drilled in the Shinarump. We had contracts on Lisbon Valley; they were later all the early contracts were all in the Morrison. And they ran from ---?--- Uravan Mineral Belt, that's where they were concentrated. First they started in the northern end and worked south. They drilled around Uravan and they drilled to the east of Uravan up there in a lot of those higher, deeper mesas. And they went south around the Joe Danny and Monogram and then they went farther on down to the Dove Creek area. Then the contracts branched out. They were hitting Morrison, and I think the first one we hit
was as I recall in the Lisbon Valley area. That would be around Steen's discovery and after--our first contract here was at the time and prior to Steen's discovery.
CE: Chinle-D?
24

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1 RS: What's that? CE: Chinle-D?
RS: Y es.
CE: Rather than Morrison?
RS: Yes. Now they call that because--we had a six-drill
camp in the valley itself, and by that time we developed modular dousing through the local lumber companies and put their efforts and ours (together] so we could load up a whole dining ha11, a forty by eight foot dining hall in sections and put it up in one day with a little truck crane. We had camp down there: shops and welding equipment and everything else by that time. Everything was mobile. We could move a camp in two days from one drill set to another, but I recall that because that was the first time I met Charlie Steen. I recall that quite distinctly because he had an air to him that was different from other fellows. He was from Texas and he came in that camp about four-thirty, five-thirty one evening and--
CE: This is about '51-52?
RS: Yeah, and he was broken down.
CE: No, this was about '52 then, wasn't it?
RS: Well, no, he was drilling his hole that time. It
resulted in the discovery of Mi Vida. But he came in 25

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN #1
one day and he had a part off his drill that was busted and a mechanic there--I just happened to be in the camp that day because we had eight or ten camps scattered from way out from the Navajo Reservation up to Morris and no roads between them. But I remember I was there and was going to have dinner and Charlie Steen came in. Charlie White who was a master mechanic there came over and said, "Say, there's a
fellow there that's busted down and he needs a gear in his head of his drill." I said, "Well, can we help him?" "Well, yes." So I had to go up there after supper so suddenly--! think I finished my dinner and walked over, and that's the time I met Charlie and he was hoping his drill could be fixed. He didn't look
very fat. In fact he was pretty skinny at that time, so I invited him for dinner and as was the custom, any visitors of the camp always got a free meal or more than that if needed. We had steaks that night, and as I recall he wolfed down at least one of them, probably two. Anyway, I never thought any more about it until about two months later. Buddy Cowder who lived at Cisco and was a friend of c. Steen's was telling me about Steen's find, how he packed his core around in the back of a pick-up for weeks and didn't recognize black uranium as being uranium. But there
26

were a lot of things like that happened. Our drilling got to get so--well, we had good drills, and the drill manufacturers worked with us closely, and on
shallower drilling the development of what they terminally termed wagondrills, air percussion drilling was developed right here in this block and by subsidiary engineering called Tungsten Bit and Tool. It in conjunction with Gardner Denver, a guy that used to buy the equipment and the burning tools that were necessitated. The so called long-hole drilling was developed here. We got drill steel makers like Bethlehem and others to make us special steel with a special large hole in the center so that you can get sufficient air down to the drill string, to the bits and blow the---?--- hole. You know the one criteria of drilling is that you've got to get whatever you're cutting out of the hole. If it stays down there, you don't go anywhere; you don't make any profits. Are you aware of air drilling?
CE: I understand the very fundamentals of it. I know what you're saying, it's logical that you would have to do that.
RS: I have pictures of some air drills we developed. The first wagon drills were mounted on halftracks, government halftracks. But they didn't have the
27

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
carrying capacity of the subsequent ones with the larger equipment you put on six-wheel drive trucks so that you could most all the equipment on it and get
it over the areas that you had to drill. Then Gardner Denver came up with what they called the three stage compressor. You run a drill string down, and you see, you had a half-inch hole around down through the center, pressure you just about ran out of at the end of a hundred feet, so they changed over to compressors and developed so they could have two hundred pound air, a hundred and eighty pounds of air. This made the removal of the cuttings possible. The development of the tungsten-carbide bits made it possible to drill these holes.
CE: So for how long did you do this drilling for the AEC? RS: Oh, we--I don't recall. I can check my diary to see what years we were through principally as a drilling
organization. '56-'57, somewhere around there. CE: So it lasted about six years, seven years?
RS:
Six or seven years. We were the principle contractor. Initially the advent of oil exploratory equipment, the heavier equipment came in, and there were a lot of these drill rigs available from Texas and
Oklahoma.
Philips Petroleum.
CE:
28

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
RS: Well, not those. I'm talking about the drilling
companies. The actual drill contractors who were working for people like Philips Petroleum. They came in here and they were paying wages down there about half of what we were paying, so they would come in and look at the prices we were getting and it sounded real rich and real good, so before you knew it they had a contract. Well, they weren't here many months before they were paying the same wages we were and they weren't as competitive on the next one, but this brought into the area many, many contractors of various degrees of ability and equipment. It developed techniques and methods of drilling that were never known. Air drilling was developed here. They used to drill all these seismographic holes with water prior to that time, but air drilling was essentially developed here, because water was so far, we used to have to pack water sometimes in trucks sixty miles, and that was the most expensive part of drilling, getting water. The percussion air drilling which I told you we developed, which is in need of a
tungsten-carbide bit--here's one of them here.
CE: It's not very big is it?
RS: No, well, you didn't picture the principle. The
principal reason why tungsten-carbide was needed 29

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN #1
was because that--that's a carbide-bit right here. They are extremely hard and wear resistant. If they were made of steel they would last only a small percentage of what this bit will before it needs
sharpening and/or we make it. The tell-tale part of a bit is what they call the gauge of the bit, and that's the outside edge. Now if this bit wears off here you've got nothing that will let it penetrate further 'cause it sticks on the side of the hole. So when the driller says a bit is gauging, he's talking about the peripheral, the outside edge is wearing. In sandstone, which this is, that is the determining factor as to how long that bit stays in the hole. The other thing you've got to consider is that if the old methods with steel bits where you were drilling you started at the top of the hole with a big bit so that when it wore out you were able to put in a smaller gauge, a smaller size bit and go back in the old hole and continue drilling, well, you actually had a inverted cone in the hole. You start out this bit smaller than the top bit. If you had a bit that could stay essentially the same size from top to bottom you had a straight-wall hole. Now if you're-- -?--- you're removing the cuttings from the bottom of the hole and you change area of the hole as it goes
30

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN #1
up, the cuttings start out at the bottom of the hole with a high velocity. They lose their velocity as they get up partway 'cause the area is increased and they get to the top of the hole in five times, four times the area; the cuttings won't bust out, they'll
just stay there and churn. So the principle you go to have a hole about the same diameter, the same area top to bottom, and the advent, ~evelopment of the Tungsten carbide-bit allowed that. It's not real simple, but with this tool it enabled mining and exploration to advance far beyond what they were before. It's the simple things that usually make things possible. Now this bit was developed right here, and this is what they call a sandstone bit. It has a lot of relief, I won't go into technical details, but it was developed by Tungsten Bit and Tool.
wrote up an article for--I think it's in the Engineering-Mining Journal, April '47--announcing the first uses of tungsten-carbide as a drilling tool in the United States. It was taken with some interest but not much initially. We worked with the first development through Ingersall-Rand Corporation out of
---?---'s subsidiary.
CE:
RS: Yes. But we had to develope something like this. I
31

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
Bishop, there we had hard rock where steel just wouldn't stand up. It wasn't a bit, and the need there was to be able to penetrate and to put drill holes into harder rock, but here your need is to keep the bit from wearing.
Did you find the AEC easy to work for?
CE:
RS: Oh, yes. They were a good, capable crowd. So was the
United States Geological Survey. Dick Fisher was the head of that and they had a man by the name of William Hudit who was a contracting officer who used to be a professor at the [Colorado] School of Mines at Golden. He was a contractor also, so they had knowledgeable people running these things. I believe a large measure of the success of the program was they had knowledgeable people running it. You could go to them if you were a contractor going to work. You could get changes done overnight as they were called for. And if you had an argument or if you had difference of opinion they didn't sit in their Golden front office, they came out and in the field. You were thrashed out right there. Oh, you might go back, back him up with---?--- with a letter, but men like Bill Hudit and others like him, if they're out in the field and they said, "O.K, you do it this way," it's a change from their contract. You did it without---
32

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
?--- You started right then, it was that attitude that made it possible to like them.
CE: Did they supervise you very stringently?
RS: They didn't supervise drillers, they only supervised the taking of the samples. The only thing they were ever interested in wasn't how you dug the hole or how you got the hole down--that was your job--but what you did with the sample. If you didn't get the required amount of ---?--- in the coal or anything
else (and that's what the hole was being dug for)
then they supervised you or they wouldn't pay you.
CE: Tell me about their sampling follow-ups. How did they
supervise that?
RS: Well, on each drill project they had a Project
Engineer, and under him were two or three, four people who were working with that project engineer and they were observing and taking the ores and samples as they were being created. Boxing them, Brother Jurard put them in a box, but then we put them in a box and documented how much core was recovered from a certain foot run. It seems to me a five foot run, you had 4.9 feet. Obviously you had almost a hundred percent core. If you lost core you know, this was usually due to the formation being cracked up or something like that or the bit of
33

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN #1
something failing--then your next run down the hole usually the Government Inspector as we called them would say, "Well, run on two-and-a-half foot poles." In other words, you can cut your poles down so you had all the strings of tools down the hole with a core-bell of course on the end and a bit on the end and run two and a half feet and come out with a string of tools and corebell. This stopped progress a great lot so that the quarry, the high ---?--- was needed by the drillers in order to get footage drilled in a day. If you slowed down on the poles it took longer to go in and out of the holes than it did to dig two and a half feet.
CE: You follow this ore through, wherever it goes?
RS: Well, the ore is usually lying horizontal and you were drilling usually vertical holes so the problem [was] there weren't many angle holes drilled in this country. W ouldn't--need them. The government for instance on our contracts usually built the roads in the area, the access roads and the drill sites; they
had their own builders and they provided that and they told you which site to move on to next. You were always having your sites and their own job. Your own engineers had a program all laid out, a pattern building or something else, and this all laid out for
34

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
the building companies, building contractors. And the sequence of drilling, you are informed continuously by your drill boss as to which hole they ought to---
?--- and the one following that. So it was a pretty closely liaison between the government people and the contractor in order to be successful. Usually the contractor established these dining halls and kitchens and he not only fed his crew, he fed the government crew. Of course there wasn't any necessity in having two sets of cooks along. You couldn't get them anyway, you know cooks are tough to get out in the field.
wife, and as the crew gets larger and we feed more people they had to go usually find and locate some other persons to help them. Usually some woman, or the wife of a driller. As the programs get out of their infancy in their first deals where they were just all men in the camps, these trailers came along, so that meant you had more services you had to create. These guys brought their wives and their families up and they had school age kids. That was something that meant someway or another create some kind of schooling, and sometimes the mothers took
This one would be.
CE:
RS: Yeah, well, usually we try to get couples, a man and
35

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN #1
upon themselves to teach their own kids in groups, take turns, and that meant that you had to set up laundries. In most of the camps every drop of water
in there had to be hauled. There wasn't any stream there and it had to be hauled through the water truck. Usually for drilling you didn't care what the source of water was. You had to have a special truck, a special tank that they would haul the culinary water in, and that meant that meant tanks in the camps. I can tell you that the services around the camps sometimes took more time and effort and money than the actual drilling.
CE: Well, the reason I asked about ore sampling, we had a microfilm or microfilm copies of the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel at our library during the preliminary portion of this project and these we studied. I remember having read that many times during the
'50s the miners who would question assays, their ore samples, they say that the big companies were cheating them. I wondered how much regulation was involved so far as the AEC was concerned and how much
you knew about this.
RS: Oh, yes. I know a lot about that, because being a
mining engineer we were well aware of what it meant to buy ores and to be on the buyer's side as well as
36

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
the seller's side, 'cause prior to being connected with uranium I had a mill in Boulder County that did the same thing. It's historical that the seller thinks the mill or the buyer is the cheapest. You have to take that with a grain of salt, but there are occasions and times when this is true. I think the
government in this case might have inadvertently cheated some people, but [they were] a very small [group] I would say. At the start of the program this might have happened too, because I think sampling facilities were archaic and not very good, but you have to understand that the government hired originally here the American Smelting-Refining Company as a contractor to handle all this sampling of vanadium and uranium that was purchased from the mills that the Atomic Energy purchased. That man was a man by the name of Martin Grains. He's still right here in town. I think Martin is eighty years old. Martin came from Chile and he was down there for American Smelting-Refining. Will Niles from this end did all the ore purchasing and buying. He has a very charming wife, a gal who was raised in Chile, a very beautiful woman. He was probably thirty, thirty-five years older than she was, but it didn't make any difference; they' re still happy and--the government
37

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN #1
man wasn't very smart in hiding---?--- from---?---
'cause nobody could say yes. I didn't know all the answers about---?---. They've been buying ores for many decades back in the early days of Colorado. Sam and---?--- and I was the starter of---?---. Well, Martin Gains took over here and they did a real job. I think they made--the buying times changed the procedures and techniques to conform with the best and latest practices of sampling.
CE: Everything was consistent then?
RS: Yes, and they oversaw it and they had--and they
didn't start this---?--- but I can tell you that in my belief what I saw I don't see where anyone had the right to kick.
CE: So these miners were asking for umpires?
RS: Most miners always think the ore is better than it is. I'm the same way, and they are the same way, and their sample of ore pile is ---?--- typically they
reach for the dust. They wouldn't be miners without doing that. But you see the miners initially--when I first came here there were no ways checking stuff by chemical balances, uranium. The advent of the counter wasn't known. I heard of the counter the first time we were operating Cooper mines down in Green southwest of Green River, Utah, at the Temple mine.
38

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
Our company was the operator---?--- and it was black ore. It was all carbonation ore so you couldn't tell-
-uranium it wasn't high grade. Now if you had the tell-tale green and yellow cast to the ore obviously you had a lot of uranium, vanadium, or if it wasn't low grade you couldn't tell ore from waste. I recall we were puzzled at how to differentiate this stuff, and a good friend of mine mentioned a lot of ore; he told me about a man by the name of Gordon Babel who had developed a geiger counter that could be calibrated and was linear in its reading. I said I don't believe it, and I'd seen geiger counters and they were all curiosities. Yeah, they click or light flashed or needles went somewhere, but they were all out of lot, and you couldn't see what you had except it had obviously land that's all. It had great activity and vacuum, but how much you couldn't tell, so I raised. I got Gordon Babel and his counters. He had made these things, and we on up to Temple Mountain and we I think--maybe it had been done previously, but at least we decided to calculate his geiger counter on the scales with known ores. By that we had positive ore that we had sampled and ground and crushed and sacked and we knew what they had analyzed. We set the counter for those and then we
39

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN #1
took them over to the unknown ore pile and came back after several weeks or months of documenting out our guesses [to find] what the unknown ore was. By comparing and checking with a known we were able to static a graph and use one of Gordon Babel's counters. We almost had to steal it away from him, he wouldn't part [with it], he didn't have any [more].
In fact, that let to our getting Babel to move to Grand Junction, and we set up a geiger counter manufacturing division over there and we made our own counters and the---?--- counter was known throughout the industry. It was copied later by people who were in the geiger counter business who started making them and making them cheaper than we did. We went out of the geiger counter business. But we had counters that were established and we probably made three or four hundred of them and they're still being used.
CE: Well, after you left the AEC as a contractor did you then start developing your property?
RS: Yes, we did that simultaneously.
CE: Oh, did you?
RS: Oh, yes, and Joe Westin was the principal man in
charge of developing the mining properties. He was doing the same job for us or with us that we did with Union Carbide. He was a Mine Superintendent, we had
40

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
miners and we--when we got to where we were shipping pretty good ore, American Metals Finance came here.
It was known as Minerals-Climax---?--- Company. We knew virtually everybody connected with it, Frank Kuball was head of it. His father was the then current president of the [Colorado] School of Mines over here. Frank was the manager, at least the head of ---?--- in the west, and the advent of ---?--- uranium was the merging of the Minerals Engineering properties of Finance Mining and the sugar plant over here. So we agreed. Minerals did so to get out of the uranium mining business; not to be in competition with ours, partly 'cause I think our group owned
either thirty-five or forty percent of Climax Uranium. We got the stock for it. In subsequent years Climax bought our minority group out. So we went on and produced tungsten and other minerals that we knew something about, but we weren't in the production age after early '52 sometime. I think that was when Climax was formed was in '52, '53, maybe 1 50.
CE: Oh, I don't know.
RS: Well, that could be documented now if Tony Mathews is
in town. Have you talked with him?
CE: I tried, but he's out of town this week and I hope
that I can encourage him to. I haven't-- 41

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN # 1
RS: He usually mines Union Carbide.
CE: Yeah, he was instrumental in writing this Union Mines
Development Company Report; his name is on it as one
of the co-workers.
RS: Tony can tell you about all this over here 'cause he,
he and---?--- Davis I'm sure worked for Climax when it first started. I didn't personally have too much to do with Climax Uranium; that was supposed to be handled by Blair Burwell. I was more interested in--at that time all the drilling division was under me directly out here on the main plateau. Oh, we branched out drilling everywhere and we'd taken in partners, joint-ventures in those days. They were the largest drilling companies there ever were. Booile Brothers out of Salt Lake, Seldy Drilling Company which is a subsidiary in Washington, it's in---?--- Plant out of Spokane, Washington. We did drilling, we--Boulder Dam, or Hoover Dam, we controlled the--- ?--- of that dam under the powerhouse. We set that in because all procedures to do it are still there, go look at them. And we went up to Caravant ---?--- in British Colombia and drilled out the underground powerhouse, but the techniques, the procedures developed on the Uranium Plateau are good. [They] just opened the field for all other types of

drilling. After that I went down in Australia and developed this wagon drill. We sold our first three d rills that the A ustralian Northern T erritory government brought for exploring in the Rum Devil

You have a pile of magazines on your desk--
Those are diaries.
Oh, those are all diaries. I see.
But they're diaries, there are just the years '56 through '64. I've got '65 through this. This is my
'70 right here. But--
You said you had time to go through some of those? Not very much, yet. It takes a long time to read those, sometimes you have to interpret your own writing too. It's fifteen years old, but I've had diaries I'm sure from the late '40s.
Anything about Union Carbide that might be of interest?
Yes, but I haven't got to--'56 is not connected too
terribly. From '45 on to '48 I found here's a little notebook, and this just starts out how we formed Minerals Engineering. I mean I was keeping track of

Or USV, excuse me, maybe you'11 take time to talk with me again--
Yes, I'll be glad to.
If you find anything that would contribute further to this. Is there anything else that you would like to develop this morning?
No, I just--I think it's pretty hard for you to imagine the conditions as existed in this field of say '54 through half the year of '57. Maybe '53 to '57. This was quite a madhouse, and if you were here and had any technical ability whatsoever and any back knowledge you should have been tripled or quadrupled 'cause the exposure, the opportunities were so bountiful, so wide. The only regret I had--and I did
at the time, I remember telling my wife, "I wish I was triplets so that I could do all of the things that were offered." Things keep coming to mind for instance, Continental Materials that was here; Continental Uranium--well, they got into the field
44

 RAYMOND SULLIV AN #1
about 1950 and I was one of the founders of that company. I was founded with a man under Gerald Gibets from Chicago. Now he is chairman of Helene Curtis Beauty Industry. Gibets came from Louisiana, from New Orleans--that' s where his upbringing is. He's scientifically knowledgeable. He was introduced to me by mutual friends out of Chicago and he had avowed
attention to get into the uranium business. He came out to get in the uranium business. It was just right after the Morrison area here was pretty well tied up, and we tried to discourage him from that. The initial times we've been out he tied up ground down in the Navajo Reservation, lots of ground there, lots of leases. I helped him do that; I was able to do this because Minerals was a pre-emption from being in the uranium business by its agreement with Climax. Then we went over to the Lisbon area and tied up a lot of ground over there. They're in Wyoming now and are very successful. I couldn't stay with them as an operator personally. I never did operate for them, I just consulted them. But these opportunities were available every week if you had enough time and wanted to do it. Of course, then the promoters came
in. They were---?--- CE: What are you doing now?

CE: So it's easy to commute to Montana when you need to. RS: Yes. Fly over Salt Lake and Bountiful or you can drive. I think Grand Junction should be here. Of course most of us stayed down here, so there wasn't any reason--and if you've got children you go to find
schools. They have good schools and it's not crowded. CE: It's not smoggy?

that you do go through your journals about what you said, and in doing so perhaps we can develop this again.
