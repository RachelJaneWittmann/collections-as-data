PROJECT. TAPE #1.J
CE: Thank you very much Dr. and Mrs. Ellinwood for inviting me into your home. I'm very anxious to talk w i t h y o u a s I ' v e t o l d y o u i n o u r p r e l i mi n a r y conversation. I'm interested in developing your work
áat Uravan as a company doctor, as a Union Carbide physician. I presume that's what you were called. Is that correct?
EE: That's right, a company doctor.
CE: Before we begin that, however, I would like, if you
EE:
would please, [you toJ tell me where you were born and raised and where you were educated.
I was born in Colorado Springs, A pril 8, 192 3. I spent most of my early life in either Manitou Springs or Colorado Springs. My father was a school teacher, one-room type school teacher and he moved out into the high plains at a place called Squirrel Creek.
That's about the first thing I can remember is the little house right on the prairie, 60 miles straight east of Colorado Springs. He taught all eight grades in this one school and high school, and then we went to a little town called Peyton, Colorado where he was
a principal of a school, 12 grades. I started school there through the sixth grade. From t here we went t o

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
a place called Monument, Colorado, which is north of Colorado Springs about 20 miles. Then we moved to Colorado Springs and I finished high school there and there shortly after my graduation I went to Colorado College for two years and then went in the Navy in World War II as a Navy corpsman. I was an operating room technician and I served in the fifth and the seventh fleet aboard an aircraft carrier, and after the war was over I came back to Colorado College and got my A.B. degree in chemistry and biology. From there I went to the University of Chicago and got a Ph.D. in pharmacology and toxicology. From there I went to Los Alamos as a staff member, research and radiobiology.
CE: When was this?
EE: 1951, 1952. Then decided I wanted to go to medical
school, and we went back to the University of Colorado in Denver for four years. I graduated with an M.D. degree in 1957. Then in 1958 I served with the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton as an intern at Oceanside Hospital, a 5,000 bed Navy hospital. Because of prior service I was discharged voluntarily
and I went to Uravan as the company doctor.
CE: Union Carbide said, "Please come."
EE: Right. Twenty-three thousand dollars in debt, that's
2

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
a good place to jump off into nothing.
CE: When did you go to Uravan? EE: 1958.
CE: 1958?
EE: September of 1958.
CE: You were alone as a physician there, or did you have someone w ith whom you worked?
EE: No, solo practice. I just spent [time] at Telluride, Colorado with a friend of mine who wanted to get away. They heard that there was a young doctor up there that didn't have any place to go, so Union Carbide or Dr. Mayon who was the medical director at that time came up there to see me and he interviewed me. I got interested and then we went down to look at Uravan and decided that was the worst place we'd ever seen in our life and we decided we wouldn't go there for all the tea in China. A month and a half later we ended up down there.
CE: Why?
EE: Because it was a good place to get your feet on the
ground.
ME: Well, do you want me to tell you why?
CE: Tell me why.
ME: Well, we sat down in Telluride--turn that off--we
looked at all the towns on the western slopes because 3

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
we really wanted to go to a small town on the western slope. So we went to all the small towns to see whether they needed a doctor. After we had gone to all of them and sat down and tabulated the whole thing according to our needs--Sharon was going to kindergarten--it's surprising, but all the towns on the western slope didn't have kindergartens except Uravan. Even Grand Junction didn't have a kindergarten. We didn't have any money to get started on. We wanted a place where they had boy scouts and a ball team, all of these for our kids, see. So when it came right down to it, Uravan had more to offer than any other town on the western shelf.
EE: Believe it or not.
CE: I do believe it because I--over the past few days--
have begun to realize how much Union Carbide does do
for its people.
ME: Well, they do, they try. So when we sat down and
figured all this out, you know--and of course the office was there, and the company paid for a nurse and that helped too, you know.
CE: Was there a clinic? Was there a hospital?
EE: Yes, there was a small clinic which had been a two or three bed hospital in the past. This was furnished by Union Carbide. They also furnished all the overhead
4

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
on it and the maintenance, heat, light , gas , water and a nurse that went along with it . So there wasn't much overhead. Plus a stipend when we went down there, five hundred dollars a month?
ME: Yeah.
EE: With the understanding, of course, that you would
take care of the industrial problems that should arise medically and in addition you could do whatever private practice came to your office. A good deal really, for a young guy who was dead broke. It's still pretty much that way except they've increased the stipend.
ME: They increased the stipend and the economy has dropped.
EE: Twelve, fifteen hundred dollars a month.
CE: What was it like at the beginning? How did you become
initiated?
EE: Well, as I said I'd been up the road to my friend's
at Telluride a month or so. He sort of indoctrinated me, broke me in with this country doctor type practice. A little terrifying at first when you realize you're the only thing between them and their salvation for a distance of better than 90 miles. You sort of snip off your umbilical cord all at once,
which we did. We learned a great deal, unf ortunately . 5

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
ME: The first day he was there somebody ran in with a boy
in his arms and just dropped him in the office and
ran out.
EE: It wasn't quite the first day.
ME: First week, yeah.
EE: First week or two.
ME: Yeah, that's right. I heard the door slam and it was
a Saturday morning and this big husky man just came in and threw his ten or twelve year old on my X-ray table and then just turned right around and ran right out. He'd been shot right through the heart with a 22 pistol. Of course I didn't know this until I had examined him and he was definitely dead.
ME: Oh, was he?
EE: Then you wondered how come, you know, somebody walks
in, throws a dead body at you and leaves.
CE: Did you find out what happened?
EE: Well, two or three hours later the whole family just
scattered like a bunch of jackrabbits. Finally they got enough composure that they came back and identified the boy. A brother had shot his little brother.
ME: He was playing with a weapon.
EE: They were getting ready to go rabbit hunting
apparently, checking the magazine and this gun went
6

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
off accidentally and put a discharge right through the boy's heart. His family 1ived up at the Golden Cycle Mine. Y ou'll probably hear about that one . This is a large mine way up on one of the points there that overlooks the entire Uravan valley, canyon, San Miguel Canyon. A very good mine which was on AEC lease which has since been shut down. That thing's still full of ore, however. It could be opened up. A huge vein of ore there, wealthy as it can be. The AEC of course controlled this lease. Someday they'll open it up again.
CE: What were your hours in days?
EE: Twenty-four hours a day. We usually opened our office
at eight. The first hour was devoted to company business of one sort or another. Then the public streamed in starting at nine o'clock and this often went on until one and we'd start again at two and would go until six, seven, eight, nine, ten o'clock at night, ten-thirty.
ME: Then he'd come home and they'd be sitting on the doorstep.
EE: I'd get in my jeep, go home and there would be three or four cars parked out in front because they didn't want to wait at the office.
ME: So, they would sit out in front and wait for him. 7

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
EE: CE: EE: CE: EE:
CE:
EE:
CE:
These were usually the Navajos.
Did you have many Navajos there?
Oh, quite a few.
Who were working for Union Carbide as miners?
Well, or the independent leasers scattered throughout the area. When I was down there they had about a hundred mines working.
This was during the--well, from '58 on? Kind of toward the end of the boom years, wasn't it?
Yeah, sort of the tail-end of it. Yeah, the economy sort of went 'kapoo' about '62. [They] started shutting down a lot of mines because they couldn't make it, because of the decrease in the Atomic Energy contracts.
[You] developed your practice, tell me what your schedules were when they weren't 24 hours a day. I assume it wasn't that way all the time. Tell me the types of patients you had and the types of complaints they had.
My goodness, they had every complaint in the world. I think I saw every disease that was known to mankind down there I've often said with the exception of leprosy.
EE:
ME: Well, the sanitary condition, some of these people worked way up there in those mines, you know.
8

 MR. EE: ME:
EE:
AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD # 1
No water.
They didn't have any water, they didn't have any toilet facilities. Really, it was just really kind of camping out. Some of those people were filthy,
filthy, dirty.
They'd haul their water in their pickups up to their tarpaper shacks at the mines. Long Park is a good example. You ought to go up on Long Park and Martin Mesa and those places. They used to be just covered with people in makeshift shacks and they lived from one paycheck to the next one. Frequently the kids weren't too well clothed or fed or anything else. I think our accounts receivable sort of detected the kind of patients we had. They frequently didn't pay their bills, or the Indians used to go down and borrow money from my pharmacist, for instance. You ought to talk to Joe Moody. Holy cow, he's really been around.
ME: He has never gone away for a long time. He's done everything over there. He knows everything.
EE: They'11 go down and borrow money from Joe and come down to pay me. I thought that was a good deal.
CE: I'll bet you did.
ME: They didn't even have a drugstore when we went there,
so they had to drive 17 miles to get their medicine. 9

 MR. CE: ME:
EE: CE:
EE:
ME:
CE: ME:
AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD # 1
To Naurita?
To Nucla. So when we got there that was the first thing we tried to do was get a drugstore. One man has the whole franchise on everything. He has the store and the boarding house.
Pete Peters, you'll probably run into him, won't you? I encountered his name today. I plan to call him and talk to him too.
He's been here on the ground floor for many, many years.
Anyway, he didn't want to put in a drugstore unless he could have liquor because he wouldn't make any money. So--
I didn't know they were connected.
Oh well, he said if he could sell liquor, he'd put in a drugstore.
EE: He'd put in a pharmacy if he could get a liquor license and sell liquor. Of course the community got in a big fight over this whether they should have the foul substance in their little town, which had been
dry before.
ME: You'd have to do what people did. All they did was
drive to Naturita and get drunk and drive back, and
that wasn't good either.
CE: I saw the roads. I'm not sure that would be good.
10

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
ME: There are terrible accidents on that road. Terrible. EE: The people, none of them had telephones so they got
sick. They just got in their--whatever conveyance they had available, and [would] go down to the doctor's office and they'd sit there until we saw them. You arrived at a waiting room that was church full and you didn't leave until it was empty.
They didn't make appointments.
They didn't make appointments and you didn't require that they do.
We couldn't.
They didn't have phones.
The only phones in town consisted of the superintendent, and I had a phone. Al1 these were company phones and a few of the foremen, or the people that were running the plant, and the mine superintendent [had phones]. These were all company phones and these were the only phones available. And no drugstore. Now we've got one.
What was the population when you got there?
I think it was about--oh, I'd say between two thousand and twenty-one hundred when we got there.
Oh, considerably larger than it is now.
ME: Then of course people came from all over, Paradox 11
ME: CE:
EE: ME: EE:
CE: EE:
CE:
EE: Oh, yeah.

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
Valley and Naturita, Nucla and Gateway. We drew from a large area.
EE: Actually I was the only MD for about 90 miles. There was an osteopath in Nucla. His name was Ed Anderson. Now he's in Denver--and myself, and that was it when we first came.
ME: And Norwood.
EE: There wasn't one in Norwood. You tried to get me to
go there, do you remember? Peters came later.
CE: Did you deliver babies or perform surgery?
EE: Oh yeah. We didn't do any surgery, but I used to
deliver babies and keep them 24 hours and then send
them home.
CE: Do you have facilities that were adequate for that? EE: They probably wouldn't be too adequate in the eyes of
our ivory towered colleagues. They were very clean. ME: We've got pretty good care.
EE: I don't think we ever had an infection that would
amount to a darn. Our babies were fine most of the time. Of course we referred a lot of people down the road, you know, because if they were critically ill there wasn't any way to really take care of them adequately, particularly some of the mining injuries,
and there were lot of mine accidents. Scads of them. CE: Why? Carelessness?
12

 MR. EE:
ME:
EE:
AND MRS. LEROY E DWARD ELLINWOOD # 1
Oh, I can't answer that. Carbide ' s always had a very progressive safety department, but irregardless when you have a hundred mines in operat i on t hings are going to happen. Most of them are cave-i ns, rocks . Rocks cave in. That's soft rock mining and it just
crumbles.
It's not like hard rock where you've got a real good overhead. This is sandstone that as you see, the stuff is just not to be trusted. As a result there were a lot of cave-ins. People squashed flatter than a pancake, some of them critically injured, and you just have to fly them out in the middle of the night, because your mines were working 24 hours a day. Most of them were working three shifts a day.
Where did you bring them? To Grand Junction?
Yeah, we'd take them in my plane and do what we could, fluids and this sort of thing and then fly them out to Grand Junction to St. Mary's Hospital. It's a good thing they didn't have to go all the way to Nucla 2O miles away to get a plane and fly to
Grand Junction.
Could you relate some of the experiences that you had other than the little boy who was thrown at you, literally.
CE: EE:
ME:
CE:
EE: I can remember one night we were sitting out there in 13

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
the backyard of our house and the personnel manager, Torn Robertson, you won't run into hirn--he's been transferred, to what is it, Arkansas? No.
ME: West Virginia.
EE: West Virginia. A call came through that they'd had a
mining cave-in and we went tearing out there and went through this long tunnel. It must have been a couple of thousand feet back to where the mine had crashed in and the safety engineer, whom you've probably seen, is Vern Bishop. He's still with the company-- went ahead of us. Then there was the mine superintendent, Jim Borden who has since deceased frorn 1ung cancer, was ahead of me and there were rocks still falling. There was a huge slab, it was about the size of this room, that came out of a ceiling or what they call the overhead. There's a mine car right out here in the middle of this and this man was trapped in it. It had cut his rear end off, just peeled it off like you would with a great big knife. You could see his rearend was impinged between the side of the mine car and the side of the rock and he was in the mine car. Of course the mine car saved his life. It kept the slab from crushing him completely. We went ahead and jacked this thing off and pulled him out and took him outside and he
14

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
almost died t wo or three times . We started an IV on him down at the mine and got him out of there and clean enough to St. Mary's. I turned him over to Dr. Joe Merrill who's a surgeon. He was here for months and, of course, he was just bare. No rearend on him at all. They had to graft him and this all got
infected and it granulated and eventually he was partially paralyzed. He had no control over his bladder or his colon. That guy finally got well and he was on welfare. This is the irony of the whole thing. He went to California and they took him on a charter fishing boat and the damn boat capsized and believe it or not, he lived through that! I haven't heard from him since. His name was Elmo Zufelt. That one I'll never forget.
ME: Then there was the guy that blew his head off.
EE: A man by the name of Rice. This was the Deer Shaft,
[and he was] setting this round. You'll have to come down to a mine out there. You should get him to take you.
CE: I've been in a mine on Cottonwood Creek. A few days ago we visited one, but I hope that I get to see some [more].
EE: Well, the Deer Shaft is a better one. This one was one of Lou Fetland's, who by the way had the lung
15

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1 cancer.
CE: EE: ME: CE: EE: ME: EE: CE: EE:
I'm going to talk with him next week. He's bad.
Yeah, he's going to die.
He told me that on the telephone.
Did he?
Poor guy, he's really a nice guy.
Well, we've been fighting that one for quite a spell. Finish the story. I'm sorry.
Well this old miner by the name of Rice had had all he wanted apparently of life, so when he finished setting his round with his spitter--you know, that thing you light the fuse with--he told his helper, "Go on, get out of here, this thing is going to go off in a minute and a half," and he stayed there. Of course, it tore him to ribbons, tore his head off,
messed him up good. Killed him instantly. Vern Bishop went down in the mine with him. Have you talked to V ern?
No, I'm going to though.
I could see a strip of this man's brain laying out in the passageway and pieces of bone spread all over and said, "Hey, Vern, what's that? Pick that up for
me, will you?" So Vern was picking up the brains. [Laugh] He didn't know until we got out. [Laugh]
CE: EE:
16

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD # 1
ME: Picking up the brains.
EE: Oh, gee.
ME: Then this one Sunday afternoon our neighbor came to
the door and he was just bleeding profusely, you know, all over the place. Anyway, he cut his finger completely off with a saw. So Eddy wrapped some gauze around it and rubber bands and he said, "Mom, look for the finger." His wife and I went out and looked
for his finger.
EE: This may sound real sadistic, but on several of these
mine injuries where the men would cut a tip off, not a whole finger, but a tip or a pad, they'd have to go back and get it and would sew it back on. Better than a skin graft.
ME: And it sometimes works, doesn't it?
EE: It takes, yeah.
CE: I've seen it where it has.
EE: You know this Hoffman woman, she cut her little boy's
finger off with a car door and she saved the finger
and we sewed it back on and it's fine.
ME: One night we had a terrible fire.
EE: Oh, yeah. That was in the middle of the winter.
ME: It was in the middle of the winter and everything
froze and we tried to get water on the fire and all the water froze to the men, because they were--and
17

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
anyway, that building burned clear to the ground.
CE: Was it an office building or one of the mills?
ME: It was one of the shops.
EE: It was the paint shop that caught on fire, probably
combustible rags there or one of those things.
ME: One night this horrible looking Indian came to the door about two o'clock in the morning. His hair was just wild, clear out here you know. He couldn't speak
very well and he said, "I could stay away baby, baby." And we said, "Well, go get the baby and go to the hospital." So he came back about two hours later. He had gone back up on some mesa and got this woman who had just had the baby, because the Indians, you know, use their midwives.
EE: Yeah, the old squaws deliver the kids.
ME: But this one had trouble and she couldn't have it
so--
EE: He got back about five in the morning and knocked on
the door. When we went outside and here was this
young Indian girl.
ME: No, no, he went over to the hospital, took her over
to the hospital.
EE: I went out and looked first. Here was this young
Indian girl and she had a baby with its head and shoulders, or with its shoulders, trunk, and feet and
18

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
so forth out of the vagina but the head was still in it. In other words, a breach delivery, and the old squaw couldn't quite hack it. Of course this has been going on since two or three o'clock in the morning. I said, "We'll go right over to the hospital and see what we can do," and on the way over to the hospital , the head popped out. Of course this was a dead baby, and she had torn herself pretty briskly. She had on about seven or eight petticoats, I remember, all of them soaked with blood and grime. You name it. I took this tear and sewed her up and then I said, "Mom, clean her up." This is Mom.
ME:
It was just the worse thing you've ever seen. She had gunny sacks wrapped around her, and about six or seven skirts you know. Oh, that poor thing was really a mess, but they brought the woman out and got the baby and brought it in a gunny sack.
Yeah, brought the kid in a gunny sack. How did they convey her to your clinic? Inacar.Inthebackseatofacar.
Oh.
EE: CE: EE: CE:
ME:
EE: Pickups.
ME: Pickups.
CE: Was there no way of educating the people?
Yeah, they had trucks and cars you know.
19

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
EE: What, the Indians? Man, they're something else. Some
of them are real sharp, and some of them just don't care.
I really don't think they care.
I saw an Indian almost scalped once, which I thought was ironical. He fell off--well, it was one of Joe's buddies, you know, who used to bring in the blankets. Anyway he fell off the great big oil bin, ten, fifteen, twenty feet into a pile of rocks and just lifted his scalp clear around here all the way around, clear around the temples. The whole thing was hanging down in his face when he arrived, he was sitting out on the clinic on a step, blood just going everywhere. I've forgotten how many stitches I took. It was at least a couple of hundred. A scalped Indian.
hear about them.
EE: Well, this family here, the husband was driving a
drift up on Martin Mesa which is not too far out of Uravan. There's a long steep grade that goes up there from the Dolores River. Two women were driving up there in a pickup and he had all the kids in back.
ME: EE:
Then the baby that got run over, that was the worst.
ME:
EE: These are all atrocities, aren't they?
CE: I 've experienced a few, so I don't grimace when I
20

 MR. ME: EE:
AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD # 1
A station wagon.
A station wagon. Anyway, they got about ha1fway up this long grade and the car stalled and they started
rolling backwards. So this one lady and big guy had just delivered a boy a couple months old. Eight months. See there how the details get away from you? Eight months old. She panicked and jumped out, and of course the car swerved and the child went flying out of her arms when she jumped out and the car swerved and landed on his head. At first the car got into a bank and stopped. Nobody else was hurt.
Well, if she had stayed in the car, you know, she would have been just fine. But she was afraid.
Of course the baby was dead.
Yeah, it ran right over the baby's head and shoulder but they didn't know the baby was dead you know. So they picked the baby up and ran down to the highway which was quite a ways and got a ride; she got a ride back into town, but of course the baby was dead, you know. That was terrible, that was one time I really thought maybe--just thought [it was] too much. But he
was really shook up that time.
Oh, there were some funny things happened too. I don't want you to think it was all gore. I can remember one day standing there in the clinic and
ME:
CE: ME:
EE:
21

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
this lady came in--her name was Gene Switzler. She had three or four kids and she was going to have a baby, but it wasn't quite her due time, but she came in and she said, "Well, I'm ready. I'm going to have my baby." I said, "That's great. Are you having labor pains?" She said, "Oh yeah, I've got a leg hanging out." "Swell," yeah, and sure enough, when I put her up on the table she had a leg hanging out. She had a breach which she delivered without any problem whatsoever. And I never will forget that old guy that--he was an old timer. His name was Hatch, Jesse Hatch had been down there for years and I think he finally died of lung cancer or emphysema. Anyway, he came down to the clinic when it was about nine-thirty or ten and I must have seen about 60 or 70 people and I was exhausted. I stuck my head out to see if there was anybody else out there and there was this old man sitting out there in a chair all humped over, whiskers and so forth. He looked at me and I looked at him and I didn't say a thing. I mean, I had just
had it. He says, "Doc," he says, "It's not my fault you' re a doctor. " It was pretty good, don't you think?
CE: Can't help but respond to that can you? Did you laugh?
22

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
EE: Yeah, that kind of brought me back to my sense of
humor anyway.
CE: You were less tired then.
EE: Right.
CE: Were you happy with the facilities that Union Carbide
provided you?
EE: Well, I can't say that I was really happy. It was
adequate. Of course I always wanted more than we had,
but we got by fairly well.
CE: Would they fulfill your demands if you asked for--
EE: Oh, sure, they'd turn flipflops if they thought I had
a real need, and of course we were always getting in a terrible bind as far as weather was concerned or as far as a mine accident was concerned. I can remember one up there in Saucer Basin that was just horrible. There were three men injured and there must have been four or five inches of mud all the way out and it took hours to get in and hours to get out. One of them died on the way out and another one in my office, which was needless if they had adequate ways to fight the land. We could've gotten in and out of there and probably saved a man or two. A huge boulder rolled off a cliff up there because of a very wet storm. I can't remember if it was snow or rain or what it was. It was in the wintertime I think. Anyway
23

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD # 1
this huge boulder knocked [down] these three men; they were in the portal of a mine--this rock came off this thing and hit three of them and it went down into the mine dump and there they laid for hours till we got there and then the hours getting out. I asked
for a good vehicle to go get these people and they gave me one. A four wheel drive, Command Wagon equipped with oxygen and stretchers and first aid and the works. No, I can't really say that Carbide ever denied any of my requests. They really tried to cooperate.
CE: When did you get a partner?
EE: Well, I was working myself to death--and here's
another ironical thing--I interned with this young fellow I thought a great deal of in the Navy. [He was] finishing up his obligations for them and he wanted to go into general practice, so I wrote and asked him to come in with me and he was in with me about three months and then AEC started cutting off all the contracts so there were two of us sitting
up there doing nothing practically. That was in 1962. Then we decided we had to do something about this, so we decided to leave. I came down here and built an office and started practicing, and a year and a half or so later moved him down.

Tell me about Uravan as a community; what about the planning, the sanitation, the water facilities?
I'm afraid Carbide isn't going to like what I'm going to tell you.
Carbide isn't going to hear this, by the way. Nobody hears it but the scholars at the University of Utah and Cal. Tech-Fullerton who are working on uranium. Sewage went into the river.
Carbide's already told me that. And that they
resolved that problem, right?
EE: Several years after I left. Raw sewage was going into
the river. The water was terrible. It was deep well water but it contained a very high percentage of magnesium sulphate, and you know what magnesium sulphate is, it's epsom salts, and until your body became used to this situation you had diarrhea.
CE: Tell me it's not that way anymore. 25

I don't know. Why don't you ask John, John Everson that or Bob Beverly?
I will, I will.
They'll tell you their water's fine, but I can tell you something else--it's terrible. Bacteria-wise it's fine. It's a deep well, but it's got epsom salts in it, magnesium sulphate. It also has a variable amount of fluoride which is fine, but it fluctuates, and I think it's not a continuous thing and many people that are raised in Uravan have terrible teeth.
Because it isn't adequate?
Because it isn't adequate, yeah. The teeth are rotten.
There are no dentists around.

What kind of housing was provided for you as a physician?
Well, we probably had the cream of the company houses of course--
That's a real ticklish situation--the housing.
Diplomatically this is a very touchy subject. This is a very touchy thing. The houses are all shells and very poorly insulated, but we had one of the larger ones which was a three bedroom, family room, and a fire place was a premium. Only about two houses in the whole town had fireplaces, right? They're all frame houses with composition roofs and not insulated at all.
Prefab type--?
Yeah. Of course you get your housing on the basis of your rank and company hierarchy. The superintendents have the best houses and the foremen the next and so forth and engineers and so forth, depending upon your status in the company. The laborers had practically
nothing. They were in shacks built right on the ground, but this is a company type situation. I think this is probably true of all of mining. I'm not sure. I've never been in any others, to live in anyway.

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
CE: I've read about others.
EE: The wives were all very envious because one house was
ten feet longer that the other one, you know, and we got one more bedroom and I got six kids and I need another bedroom. Why I sure don't envy or wouldn't envy that personnel manager at Uravan who was--his name was Tom Roberts, at that time. He was a sharp young fellow .
CE: He had to take care of these problems.
EE: He had to take care of all of those last little
nitty-gritty problems. Of course, somebody'd move and then they would all be fighting for this house, you know, but our facilities were very adequate. The rent was dirt cheap. I think we paid what? $40 a month, $42 a month for our house and they went on down from
there. The miners probably didn't pay more than 15,
$20 a month for theirs, at the most.
CE: So when I go down there I'11 see what I've been
hearing about today. One of the people with whom r talked showed me many pictures that he's been taking over the years and many pictures that were taken during the Standard Chemical Company days. Did you study the history of Uravan?
EE: Uh huh.
CE: You know about Standard Chemical Company and how that
28

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1 was initially a town built by them?
EE: Right. As a matter of fact, one of their dumps was just up the block. You should know about the various parts of town. B block is where the mail superintendent's and mine superintendent's and my house was, plus several of the mining engineers. They were very small houses in a beautiful spot in the summertime because there were huge cottonwood trees and shade, and that's a premium in that hot canyon in the summertime. Right up the road is an old Standard Chemical Company mine dump which was loaded with radium and a few other things--uranium, and hotter than hell, which they used to bury because it was way out of tolerance. Of course the kids used to go out there and play and all that stuff all the time. So they buried that when I was down there. I'd
hate to think what Public Health would think about it now, about all this nonsense, about the radon and the fields around our houses here in Grand Junction, because that was really a hot one. Speaking of hot ones, on a hot summer night in Uravan, after the sun had been up all day long you could see the radium seeping out of the cliffs up there and glow just like
the dial on a radium watch. Of course everybody tried to ignore the fact that this is what it was, but
29

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
that's what it was I'm sure. This was the radium seeping out of the rocks from the tailings on top of the mill over a period of 15, 20, 30 years. I'll-- you'll still see it in the summertime.
What was your reaction to that? What did you do? Nothing. No. I was appalled coming out of Los Alamos where everything was so strictly and constantly monitored with regard to radiation of any type, alpha, beta, gamma, the whole gamut. You couldn't do anything there with a monitor being continuously at your side telling you, "Don't go in there. Don't do this. You have enough for a day, go home."--to Uravan where nobody knew anything about nothing with regard to radiation. Absolutely nothing. I was appalled. Weren't you concerned about your welfare and that of your family?
CE: EE:
CE:
EE:
Well, we often wondered, and you know about all the dust in that town. How much of it was really radioactive, how much of it would cause some harmful exposure? Of course as it turned our many of these houses were built on these old fills and they were hotter than hell. I hold the Atomic Energy as
responsible for that nonsense. They knew this.
They didn't do anything.
CE:
EE: They didn't do a thing about it.
30

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
CE:
EE:
The Public Health Service were the first to do anything.
I think Carbide really is innocent because they didn't know, but the Atomic Energy Commission people should have know and they didn't do anything about it. This is who I think is at fault really. Of course, after what, 34 years? It's too late. Many of these men have received very high doses of radon daughter exposure and they're going to pay the consequences. The history in Germany is well written down and documented. That little town, I can't ever remember the name of it. Something like Straussberg of Strausselberg. Anyway, it's part of the history record which is well documented. Better than
50% of those men who mined pitchblende all died from cancer of the lung and emphysema. So they should have been able to tell it was coming, but they didn't.
Is that one reason you left, because you were concerned about it?
Oh no. No, we left purely because of economical reasons. The economy was going to the dogs and we had to think about other places to make a living.
You don't think that your exposure was harmful?
CE:
EE:
CE:
ME: Well, I kind of doubt it.
EE: Because you were in an environment where it wasn't
31

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
concentrated. Well, a ventilated environment. Where you get in trouble with radon is in an enclosed atmosphere, one in which there is no fresh air and no ventilation. That's where the radon daughters give you the business. In other words, in an enclosed space [such] as the face of the mine which is poorly ventilated you're really sticking your neck out because that gas concentration builds up and to the point there where I'm sure the early miners were really exposed to terrible quantities of this material.
CE: Because there wasn't any ventilation?
EE: No ventilation at all. They didn't bother to
ventilate. It was too expensive to ventilate. This
was pure nonsense.
CE: Their equipment freezes. They get pneumonia.
EE: Right. They get more colds, respiratory infection.
It blows out their matches so they can't light their cigarettes, which is harmful too in combination with radon.
CE: That was my next question.
EE: Yeah, I quit smoking.
CE: No, not in effect to your habits but Mr. Beverly
mentioned when I interviewed him that almost without exception the people that have died of lung cancer as
32

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD # 1
a result of over-exposure to radiation were also smokers.
EE: This is true. There's only been one man in this area, there have been several Navajos down around the Grants area that developed lung cancer that did not smoke. There's only been one in this area, and that was that good Mormon boy who never smoked a day in his life who developed lung cancer. One man out of a total of--this is a nebulous figure--you never can pin this thing down for some reason, but it's in the neighborhood of a hundred and ninety plus or minus ten, and a hundred and forty some odd proven autopsy cases of lung cancer and there's only one and that was Matt Rode, the Mormon contractor, that had lung cancer that did not smoke. So there is something to it. I mean smoking and radon together are just plain hell. That's all there is to it. Of course if you get a chance to go in the mines--of course they've cracked down on smoking. You'11 see why these men smoke continuously or did. A cigarette was always
hanging out the corner of their mouth and they would just let it dangle there and work you know and spit the thing out and get another one and fire it up.
Some of the men were chain smokers, many of them. This of course has been shown to be synergystic,
33

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
which Dr. Sakomara and I sort of arrived at this conclusion and got the statistics together and it's true. It is synergystic.
CE: I've read part of the hearings; you appeared before the senate. We have the hearings at school and I scanned them, so I'm aware that he's really campaigned.
EE: Yeah, I quit smoking after my twelfth case of lung cancer walked through my office. This convinced me--a man 35 years of age [with a) great big lesion right here and his mediastinum to his neck even. His name was Henry Doffel and this was rather unique in that he's still alive. I sent him to Grand Junction and the brains down here at the time vetoed him, told him it was to late. Nodes in the neck, this is a metasitis. There's nothing we can do. Go on home, but we didn't quit there. I sent him to Colorado General
where I went to school and they gave him five uracil which is a chemical tumor type drug that works fairly well for some kinds of Neoplasia, and they gave him this, and a very short one, several weeks--it didn't hung on too much, and they opened him up and took another biopsy and the cancer was so extensive they just closed him back up and they subjected him to cobalt. Interestingly enough, the man that did this
34

 MR.
AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD # 1
was Bruce Ward, who is our radiologist here now in Grand Junction. The man was cured, and that's been ten years ago. One case out of about 75 that I can think of, one. He's still alive.
Because you were a contributing factor to the fact that he was able to get well.
Oh, I don't think so. I think it's just a matter of chance and statistics. There's a bit of irony on that case too. When he had his lung cancer, of course he realized what he .had and he became very morose and depressed and social security took pity on him and gave him a pension at the age of 35. After ten years they decided he was going to make it and cut him off and he's been [madder] than hell ever since. Still doesn't want to work because he's got lung cancer. The one man that's been saved out of this whole mess went on welfare and social security and then they cut him off and told him he had to go back to work after ten years.
CE:
EE:
CE: He still has lots of potential. He's only 45.
EE: He's fine, very mad at the government though.
CE: It's kind of hard to go back to work after loafing
that long. What was it like so far as social activities were concerned? What did you do, living in Uravan, so far away from the city?
35

 MR. EE:
CE: EE:
AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD # 1
Well, of course we had our neighbors and we played a lot of bridge and did a lot of drinking. Imbibed a great deal of alcohol.
Out of boredom? Surely it was.
I wasn't bored too often. But when we had a chance these were our two outlets: they used to have a good get-together every once in awhile over at the community center which is a big barn-1ike building and they danced to a three piece orchestra and drank up a storm. Later on we'd have several good fights.
Y ou'd go back to work.
Go back to work. Oh, I think this is typical of the mining towns. What else did we do?
I don't know.
We used to do quite a bit of hunting. That's a fantastic area for hunting. I did when I got a chance.
Elk, deer?
Yeah, primarily deer in that immediate vicinity,
ducks, fishing, we'd fish up and down the San Miguel River, Telluride, Woods Lake, Alta. We used to jeep a lot too. We had a jeep. We'd shoot around those jeep roads, all around that country. Paradox Valley, La Sal Mountains and really quite interesting country if you like the out-of-doors. The deer hunting was
CE: EE:
ME: EE:
CE: EE:
36

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
fantastic for a while down there until they overdid their seasons. Used to go out and as many licenses as you could buy you could shoot that many deer.
CE: You can't do that for too long, can you?
EE: No, not and keep the herds up.
CE: Did you find you had to go to town to get the things
you needed or where the stores adequately stocked for
your needs?
ME: Oh, they were adequate for me, they weren't for a lot
of women. I'm not much of a shopper so I didn't--a lot of the women would come down to Grand Junction, you know, once a month and buy their groceries, but it was fine for me.
CE: Did you have any church?
EE: Oh, yeah. We're Episcopalians and one of my neighbors
who was the purchasing agent, his name is Orville Miller. He works out here now at Carbide office and he was also an Episcopalian and he wrote the bishop of Colorado asking him if there wasn't some possibility that we could have a mission in our area. Of course he didn't hear and didn't hear and didn't hear. One day he got a phone call from the bishop who
was in Grand Junction and he was coming down and this was Bishop Cordon. He was the Sufferdon bishop at that time. He came to town and talked to five or six
37

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
of us who were Episcopalians and we had communion at seven o'clock in the morning. I never will forget this. It must have been three below zero. He didn't have any unleavened bread so we just used plain old bread and some wine that somebody brought over. It was a rather inspiring service for most of us who hadn't been to church for ten, fifteen years.
We had church once in awhile.
From then on we had it.
Someone came in?
Right.
From here?
From here to Grand Junction.
So you won.
We had another church.
Well, we had the community church, and the minister lived down the road.
ME: EE: CE: EE: CE: EE: CE: ME: EE:
CE: ME: EE:
What was his last name? What was Willard's last name? Studebaker.
Studebaker, yeah. It was a very lovely family. What would you call them, fundamentalists?
ME: Yeah.
EE: Baptists. He did a lot of good work for those poor
people in that area. Lots of good work. CE: Most of these people are not educated.
38

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
EE: Right.
ME: Well, you've got two factions, haven't you?
EE: Well, yeah, you've got your company people and the
so-called salaried employees your engineers, superintendents and so forth. Then you have the other and the working--the laborers are primarily uneducated or high school education at the most. Most of them went to that church, didn't they? Half of them if they went at all.
CE: Were they segregated in town? You said that you had special houses, but were the two groups segregated?
EE: No. They had them pretty well intermingled, didn't they?
ME: They might have.
EE: Well, we would go into Mead Rock and they were
working miners right there in this block. Forest area; I think you ought to look while you're there. That'll raise your hair. It's called the flat tops, cement floors. Well, I should have turned in there
years ago.
CE: They're so inadequate, that's what you're saying?
EE: No, they're awful.
CE: Couldn't you recommend that they be improved for the
welfare of the residents?
EE: I could, but I don't think I would have gotten
39

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
anyplace because they were either you iive there in town with what they had or you live in a trailer house or outside of town.
ME: Mr. Staker was there who is the bishop now. He gave paint to all of those people and grass seeds and they could get this if they wanted.
Scratching on the tape.
He gave them paint and grass seeds to fix up the flat tops, and some of those people did fix their places up cute. They painted grass and they painted their houses, those who cared, but then some of those people just don't care at all. But at that time-- well, the company did give them things to fix up their flat tops, and some of those people had them fixed pretty cute.
CE: ME:
EE: Yeah, some of them did a beautiful job, they took care of things and others just--like they do in town, you know. I mean you've got your people that really take pride in what they' re doing and where they' re living just like they do at Five Points in Denver.
Some of those places are beautiful and other places
are a shamble. [It's the] same in Uravan.
CE: What's Five Points? I'm not familiar with that. EE: Oh, it's the colored section of Denver.
CE: So you don't think there was really any pride or 40

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1 community pride?
EE: Oh, I think some of them did, took pride in what they had.
ME: Yeah, some of the people did. The staff people did, you know, because a lot of those people were well educated people, kind of like being in the Army and having the enlisted men and then the others.
EE: Very much like the service, right.
ME: That's just the way it was. The laboring people
resented the staff people and the mining people kind of fought with the milling people and there was always that faction.
EE: Have you talked to Mary Gordon?
ME: She's not going to talk.
EE: She might. She's lived there for years. She used to
have a saying, "There were two factions, there is mining and milling," you know they stuck pretty much to the section and the will of the doctor and she used to say, "Well, we have mining and milling and then we have you." But we were sort of in the middle. She used to put it another way, but I'm not going to
tell you what it was.
CE: What was the cost of medical care to the patient? EE: The private patient?
CE: This wasn't free medical care?
41

 MR . EE: ME: EE:
CE:
ME: CE:
EE: CE:
EE: CE: EE: ME:
EE:
AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1 No.
W ell, explain what you did.
As a private physician we used to charge three dollars an office call.
Why don't you come to California if that's your practice? We'd love to have you.
It wasn't that cheap in California. [Laugh]
We pay seven dollars for an office cai1, eight most of the time now, and twelve often.
For years we charged three dollars an office call. Now was this just to company people or was this to--?
Anybody.
Anybody.
We didn't care who you were.
What he did for the stipend, he had to give a physical to all the workers.
I'd give them their physicals and take care of their state compensation acts. Industrial medicine type stuff which the company was liable for. Of course, there was no charge to the patient on that basis
because the state compensation had to pay for their
problem if it could be proved to be industrial.
ME: How could you do that with a lung cancer case?
EE: Well, this was a big battle you know. For a long time
42

 MR.
AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD # 1
the state refused to admit liability in these cases and I can remember the first one we had. His name was Buster Johnson. He was one of the first lung cancer cases that was compensated. From then on the widows would get a good lawyer and they could get their money on state compensation. But this was the first breakthrough in which they paid the family and admitted that this was an industrial disease. Buster Johnson, that was in 1959 I believe or in that neighborhood.
I remember having read that the state of Colorado did accept this.
Atomic Scientist, October '67 had a very extensive article on it and was trying to find the specific date.
CE:
ME:
CE: Well, I'm pretty sure it was 1959 or the latter part of 1958. I remember that man very well. He was one of your patients?
EE: Right.
CE: Did you have a fire department or a police
department?
EE: No, that was a voluntary fire department. Of course
then the great big fire we had when part of the mill burned down, we had a sheriff who is incidentally the sheriff at Delta who is down the road about 40 miles.
43

 MR. CE: EE: CE: EE:
AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD # 1
Forty miles away you had a sheriff.
No, we had one 20 miles away.
You didn't get too much crime?
Well, we had some, but nothing was ever done. We had I'm sure several good murders which were never followed through in the valley. Not just in Uravan. In Naturita, Nucla, Norwood, Uravan, Paradox area. All of them kitty-cornered by the way. Assistant county corner. The county seat for that end is Montrose, which is a hell of a long ways off. How far is that, a hundred miles or something? Better than that I think. Well, I'm pretty sure that there were several murders committed up there. I can remember one man was deliberately, I think, run over right in the middle of the highway and nobody ever found anything out about this. I can remember another one
whom I 'm sure was hit in the head with something, terribly hard, caved in his skull and they went to a very nice little place in the road where it won't bend like this and then curve--of course the river came along here, so that they had gone in the river. Now I'm probably putting together these things. I saw it at the time. Anyway, this situation backfired on him and instead of the car going into the river it went into the bank and when it hit the bank it jarred
44

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD # 1
the man loose and threw him out the car door which was not completely closed and he fell on the pavement right next to the car and I know darn well this injury could not have caused his death. I'm sure he was killed, pushed into the car, and was pushed down the hill. But I never could convince our sheriff that this was the case. We've had several real good murders in the area. Nothing ever came of them. So actually we were sort of without law and without a real good smart law man, let's put it that way. He was a nice old guy but he just didn't do anything about anything. Many people died and they never had an autopsy because there wasn't any way to do one. We had to send them to Montrose to get an autopsy. There was several cars going in the river and men being thrown out, drowned. Some terrible head-on accidents where four or five people would be killed at one time. Of course I get called out for all these things. Lots of alcohol involved in most of these
accidents. We had several drug addicts in our midst that were running from the law enforcement people. Of course that was a nice place to hide because nobody would ever find you. They'd go to work in some of those mines up there. I remember when Lark Washburn
had--do you remember that one? Lark got them out of 45

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD # 1
the penitentiary and put them to work in the mines which--they're very disreputable people most of them. This one was a narcotic addict and he just about had enough of this and he had to have--to get back on his habit. By the way, before he did this he was stealing cocaine and terpin hydrate out of the drugstore and he was coming down the hill up above the mill and he got his truck going and stepped off the running board and 1et it go down the canyon, end over end, and threw himself out in the middle of the road and that's where they found him, laying out there. I was called in, of course, and here's this guy all sprawled out in the road, all dusty. There wasn't a damn thing wrong with him and he was moaning and
groaning and carrying on and of course saying I fell for the trap. I gave him a nice big jolt of demarol which he dearly loved. Of course this didn't hold him. It wasn't enough, and when you hit someone with a hundred milligrams of demarol and that isn't enough, your suspicions start to come to light. Well, as it turned out, this guy had hash marks all the way up and down both arms. He had been a peddler and a pusher and that was the reason he was in the penitentiary. Well this guy ended up over there. When we found out what was going on we shipped him
46

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1 back to the penitentiary.
CE: He didn't attempt to steal any from you?
EE: No.
CE: How would Washburn use these people?
EE: Gee, I don't know. Lark's quite a guy really, as you
probably found out. I don't know whether he was trying to rehabilitate them or whether he wanted some cheap labor, probably both.
CE: You didn't then think that there was any problem with racial segregation in the community?
EE: No, we never had any race problems. We had quite a few Spanish-Americans and they worked right along with everybody else. The Indians were in and out. Of course, they stayed pretty much by themselves, they
lived by themselves, they had their own problems. I saw them as the doctor. They went to our store, our drugstore and so forth.
CE: What kind of schools did you have?
EE: Well, they were adequate. I was on the school board
for two years when I was down there. We had a fairly good superintendent that was well experienced. He came for Oklahoma. His name was Eugene Norr. He was a very good man in financial affairs. He was not a very good administrator, but the schools I thought were adequate. Our pitfall was in acquiring adequate

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
people who were trained to be teachers. Of course salary scales were not the best in the world.
ME: Oh, they were pretty good.
CE: Well, by other people's standards they were all right
but to get somebody to come to that little valley and stay there is another problem. It's 1ike you can't get a doctor to stay there. There's just nothing there to hold them. A couple of years out there and they think about greener pastures. All my kids went to school there. Billy went through the eighth grade. I have five kids, by the way.
ME: Well, the grade schools weren't too bad, but the high school was.
EE: The high school was terrible.
ME: It wasn't accredited or anything. That's one reason
why we left you know, because it's really not a very
good place for teenagers.
EE: There's not enough for them to do.
ME: Teenagers just get in trouble.
EE: And then they get to high school and the girls escape
high school without getting pregnant there's
something wrong with the girl.
CE: There's just nothing to do.
EE: Nothing. A lot of those kids go right back into the
mines too you know, as soon as they get out of 48

school. Their dad worked in the mines, "Come on son, I' 11 get you a job wi th the leaser, " and then they get into that weekly check bit and why do anything else?
The teachers don't inspire them to--?
Oh no. Well, I wouldn't say that. There's always an exception to the rule. I remember Rock Graham went through that high school. He finally got into the Air Force Academy and has been a real fine example.
I suppose the company, because it owns the town, is very influential so far as the school board is concerned. I assume they have several company people who are on the board besides--
Well, and then we're all elected officials and there- -how many were there, three?
CE: EE:
CE:
EE:
ME: I don't remember. There are probably more than that. EE: There are five. That's right. Five on the school
board.
CE: A total of how many school board members were there? EE: Five.
CE: Oh, five. A total of five, and two of those were
company people?
EE: Yeah. Of course I was one of them. I was considered
company I guess. CE: Was there poverty?

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
EE: CE: EE:
Oh yeah.
Among the Indians whom you mentioned or--?
The Indians inherited a lot of people there that were just down and out, 1ived from one paycheck to the next and frequently they moved around a lot. They worked for one man for one or two [weeks] and then jumped off and [would] do nothing for a week or two and then go back to work for another month or so. You know how it is. Just labor type mining work.
Lots of turnovers then?
Turnover is tremendous here.
Was it always?
Transient, yeah.
Among this group of--
We figured roughly that there'd been five thousand men in and out of the Plateau. Now that's a lot of
men. They'd migrate from Wyoming and the Gas Hills country to Grants, New Mexico, to Arizona to copper mines and gold and silver mines. They'd just go it in a big circle.
CE: EE: CE: EE: CE: EE:
CE: Five thousand during what period of time? From when to when?
EE: Oh, I'd say from what? After the war through my time down there.
CE: That's fifteen years.
50

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
EE: Uh huh. Fifteen or 20 years. I think Public Health
tries to keep track of at least five thousand men who
have been in and out of uranium mining.
CE: Why does Public Health do this? Because of the
radiation?
EE: Because of the radon hazard, uh huh.
CE: Each of these people is registered with some
organization, is that what you're implying?
EE: Right. Public Health is a research project on the uranium miner that's been going on since 1940, something or another. It's under the jurisdiction of a man by the name of Dr. Victor Archer who lives in Salt Lake City. That's where his office is and his-- they have had teams that went through here, doctors examining these miners on a periodic basis for a number of years. They try to keep track of where they
are, what kind of sitology they're coughing up.
You're acquainted with this word?
CE: Uh huh. We had a neighbor who is an internist and
when he is--when his secretary's nurse is on vacation I substitute, so--and he happens to be a chest man. His specialty is chest disease, and I'm familiar with this terminology because of that.
EE: Well they try to keep track of the sitology when they undevelop the metaplasia or class two, stage three,
51

 MR.
AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD # 1
which is indicative of something that's starting to build or change. Then when they go to class--frank class three and four. Four is a definite malignancy and five there isn't any question about it. Then they try to herd these men to their family physicians or a clinic or someplace where they could take care, be taken care of.
How often are they examined?
I think they try to do them every six months.
They're that concerned with this?
Sure, they know they've got a problem. They spend a lot of publicity here and there, by politicians and about the uranium miner off and on all these years. Some of it's good and some of it's very bad. I don't think people really woke up though until the early
'60s as to what was taking place, for sure. They knew there was a hazard, but then all these men just started coming in flocks. Four or five of them a month, you know, of the cancer here and there or someplace. Fortunately it started to taper off a little bit, so all the high exposure guys, if they're going to get one they've either got it or are on
their way to heaven.
Bob Beverly said yesterday that it is dropping.
CE: EE: CE: EE:
CE:
EE: Yeah, that's true.
52

 MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD # 1
CE: And the younger miners haven't decreased, have they? EE: Oh yeah.
CE: Is this relative or--?
EE: Well I--well, certainly there isn't the activity
along the plateau that there was ten years ago in mining. So there are not as many men working. The other facet is they've cut down on the smoking and ventilated all their mines to the nth degree through Public Health urging and the state monitoring group and so forth. So actually, they've cleaned it up a great deal over what it was in 1958.
CE: Are there any special problems at Uravan other than those that you've discussed that you'd like to talk about?
EE: Special problems?
CE: Pollution problems, for instance.
EE: No, I think we've probably pretty well covered them,
ME: EE:
the tailings, the radon that seeps through the rock, the radium, the dust.
It smells too.
It smells. It used to be much worse before. They used
to have a vanadium roaster in which they used free hydrochloric acid to roast the stuff. The air was full of hydrochloric acid fumes--as you can see all the trees around for miles and miles are all dead
53

       MR. AND MRS. LEROY EDWARD ELLINWOOD #1
form hydrochloric acid fumes. I'm sure it must have been a hellish place to live when they were doing that. Can you imagine that blowing around in the area? That would make Los Angeles look like a pipe dream, wouldn't it?
CE: I'm not sure. Have you been there lately?
EE: I don't want to go either.
CE: Don't. Don't. Wel1, thank you both very much. I
appreciate the time you've given me and the information. I'm looking forward to my trip.
