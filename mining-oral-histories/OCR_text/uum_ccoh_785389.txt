 [THIS IS AN INTERVIEW OF WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON. THE DATE IS JULY 18, 1993. THE INTERVIEWER IS MADE TOMSIC.]
MC: Mr. Walt Donaldson will be telling us about life in the mining camps. And more specifically, Standardville,

Spring Canyon, and that area.
That would be, start out at Winter Quarters, Consumers, and Standardville, mostly.
Oh that is wonderful. Well, I'm going to get my questions here, in case. Now Do you have a format? A way that you want to do it, Walt?
Well, I've got it all typed out here in story form. You
just stop me. I tried to keep it orderly, rather than just rambling on and on.
But I think it would be better too, if you just sort of told it. Instead of read it.
My mind is not what it used to be.
Whose is?
You'd wind up doing half the interview if I didn't look at my notes. I can just stick with it.
You're lucky that you've got kids to call. Right? Ok Walt, you do it the way you are comfortable.
You just stop me any place you want and--
Ok. And if I have some questions I'll just stop you and ask you, ok?
You just say when.
Go ahead.
Well, my earliest recollections of mining camp life was

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
at Winter Quarters, which is about a mile west of Scofield. Both of my grandfathers carne to that community before 1900. Both carne from Pennsylvania. My grandfather Donaldson was a stone mason, who done a lot of stone work around the mines. And helped cut the sandstone from the area around Winter Quarters to build the walls of the old Wasatch Store which was owned by the Utah Fuel Company. This company also owned Clear Creek and Castle Gate,
Sunnyside and Sornrnerset, Colorado.
Both of my grandfathers were employees at the Winter
Quarters Mine when it blew up in May, the first of May, 1900, killing about 200 men. And in some cases wiping out the entire male population of a family because the boys started to work with the fathers at an early age. The work was hard and everything was done by hand. There was no cutting machines. They would take a number of picks in the mine every day because they would be dulled as they picked on, against the solid surface of the coal to undermine it, which was later done by cutting machines and now with more modern machinery.
MT: May I just ask you something?
WD: Yes.
MT: What happened to your grandfathers? They both worked in
the mine?
WD: Uh, we'll get down to that in just a little bit.
2

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
MT: Ok. I won't interrupt you then.
WD: No, it's all right.
MT: Great. Go ahead.
WD: They only got paid for what they loaded. They were
contract loaders. In some cases if they couldn't get empty cars or if their place filled with water, which happened because there was a lot of water in that country, they had to wait around all day and not get paid for it because they couldn't come out. It wasn't safe to walk in the main haulage way and the company didn't want to stop the production and moving of coal.
My grandmother Donaldson had a very large family. She had to wash all the clothes, including her husband's heavy work clothes, grimy and dirty as coal would be. This was done on a scrubbing board and a wash tub and she'd have to wring them out by hand. She was a very small, wiry woman and probably didn't weigh more than 125 pounds. She would also have to make bread and pies for her husband's lunch the next day. The men all expected fresh pie and you couldn't buy those things at the store. Bread making was an everyday event and then after all this was over with, if they were 1ucky to have the newspaper, she would have to read my grandfather the newspaper because neither one of my grandfathers could read or write, which was not unusual in those days.

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
My grandfather on my mother's side was Isaac Morgan.
He was a Welch coal miner and although he couldn't read or write he was haulage boss at Winter Quarters for many years when he had several hundred men working and I don't know how he kept track of where the timbers would go during the day or the black powder or other materials needed in the mine or how he even kept track of all the haulage when he couldn't read or write. Both of these men worked at Winter Quarters when it blew up in 1900. My grandfather Morgan escaped because he was either down at the mine or went to another part of another mine. My grandfather Donaldson and his oldest son, John, who was 14, were miffed at my grandmother because she didn't wake them up to go to work that day. She had a premonition of danger, or so that's the story I've been told.
My dad went to work in one of the Scofield mines when he was 13. When he matured he was only 5'6" and so he was very small when he started to work and had a hard time keeping his dinner bucket out of the snow as he walked to work. If a piece of coal fell on his toe or he suffered some other minor injury he was small enough that he would cry and my grandfather would tell him to pick up his bucket and go home and send one of his sisters in to help my grandfather work. It was a common practice in those days that the father picked up their son's paycheck
4

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
or cash. I guess they paid in cash in those days. And the boys had to ask the parents if they wanted a nickel to buy a candy bar.
My recollection of the Castle Gate explosion in 1924 was that I was in our backyard, which was only a few feet from the railroad tracks in Winter Quarters, and the train was hauling down timber and other material for the Castle Gate Mine and I remember one of my relatives was visiting at that time and she shed a few tears because her uncle, Andrew Gilbert was one of the victims.
The winters were severe and the only way out of town was by rail. All merchandise and food came to the area by rail. There were very few autos, even if there had been a road. We had one of the few cars in Winter Quarters and in the fall the tires were removed and the vehicle placed off the ground on four short pieces of railroad ties. Sometimes this period lasted from September to early May.
From earliest childhood we were steeped in the lower tragedy of the mine disasters and there was a miner strike in 1922, when as I understand it, Utah miners went on strike mostly out of sympathy for the Wyoming miners. As my father was one of the strikers, we had to vacate the company house and move to Ogden until the strike was over. We learned at an early age what the word scab meant. That it was someone who filled a striker's job.

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
The national guard was called out and formed a line across the bottom of Winter Quarters Canyon. There were
some shots fired during this strike. Sam Dougherty was a U.S. Marshal, who had his office in the company mine office at Winter Quarters, and I still remember as a kid that they had a rack of 30-30 rifles and I guess that was to remind us who the boss was. In coming to Scofield from Winter Quarters, he was fired upon by some Greek miners and his horse died of several bullet wounds after he dismounted at the Wasatch barn in Winter Quarters.
The Scofield Dam was built when I was about six. The reservoir now covers what was formerly a beautiful valley of wild hay. It was cut and stacked for animal feed, particularly horses, and sometimes they would bring teams in from San Pete County and we used to go down and watch these beautiful teams work as they put up the hay every summer. I believe that even after the reservoir was constructed that John Staley managed some of the hay ground that was still left between Scofield and the dam for use at the mines, for horses were still used to some extent to haul coal. Not long after it was built, the dam developed a leak and some of the local residents went down and stayed all night, thinking that the dam was going to wash out, which would have done a lot of damage to Castle Gate and a little to Helper. However, materials
6

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
of all kinds were dumped into the hole and the dam was saved and later on it was rebuilt.
MT: WD:
MT: WD: MT: WD: MT: WD:
Starting school was a very pleasant memory. I was a good student and thoroughly enjoyed it. The spring would be green and fresh as we went to school and the fall was beautiful with the green pines and yellow-red leaves on other trees along the side of the canyon. My first teacher was Elizabeth Lund from Midvale, Utah. This would be 1926. I don't know if teachers had to complete four years of college at that time or not, but I recall that
she was very young. She wore glasses and on the first day she wore a dark plaid dress. We always had at least weekly silent movies in the amusement hall and Tom Mix, Hoot Gibson, William D. Hart and the old time dog star, Rin Tin Tin.
Walt, where was the schoolhouse at that time?
The schoolhouse was just about 200 feet north of the Wasatch Store and it had only been built a couple of years when I started school.
Was it a brick or?
Yes. Nice brick school.
It was?
Very nice school, yes.
Right there in Winter Quarters?
Right in Winter Quarters, just above the store. Of course
7

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
you could always tell the good guys in the silent movies, they wore white hats and always rode the nice looking horses. We had a little hospital in Winter Quarters and
in every camp I ever lived in we were blessed with good medical doctors. That's one thing you can say for the companies, that they hired the best. There were students in our school that were from most of the nations of Europe. It seemed like we had a lot of Austrian kids and I remember the little Finn girls with their blonde hair because their stocking caps and heavy woolen socks and their dresses nearly always contained the colors of red, white and green and they were often in circular patterns. Winter Quarters had a new school and it was good and
adequately staffed.
John L. Perri had a dairy southeast of Winter
Quarters and just south of the Lee Thomas Ranch and he delivered milk by bob-sled or team. In winter months, the railroad tracks which ran parallel to the road was the main thoroughfare. The men used it to walk to work. We used it to shop at the company store, to go to church, school and activities in the amusement hall. Our parents were concerned about walking up the track because the snow plow would come up from Scofield every morning and clear the tracks and the snow was stacked over our heads and there wasn't much room between the train and the
8

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
banks of the snow. There was a story that years before,
just below Winter Quarters, a woman and two of her children were caught in the tracks and couldn't escape and were killed by the train .
Ice cream could be bought at the store, but we, our ice cream was generally milk placed in a lard bucket with vanilla and sugar and put in the snow in our backyard until it became crystallized. We had few fresh vegetables in those days. People had root cellars for potatoes and apples. We had lots of meat. Lots of homemade bread and pastries and lots of canned goods. They generally had a stack of bananas hanging in the store and even in those days we had jello, which was our favorite dessert. So jello was an old dessert.
There was a Mr. Lewellyn from Scofield who used to come through Winter Quarters with a team with fish that had been shipped by rail and he would yell ''fresh fish, fresh fish" as he went up the canyon and ... my parents would come out and buy different kinds of fish from him. There was also an older Greek fellow, I think he was from Clear Creek, we called Deaf John. I don't know what his real name was. He'd drive up through the canyon with a little wagon and sold ice cream cones.
One of the big events of the spring was when the horses came back to town. There were probably only, maybe
9

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
half dozen autos in town, if I remember right. But most people owned a saddle horse or two. For the most part they were not the large saddle horses we have today like
the husky quarter horse or the thoroughbred. Most of them were very small animals. Every summer the Indians would come from the reservation country and camp below Scofield at the mouth of what we called Smith Canyon or Woods Canyon. There's a kind of a foul smelling sulfur spring that emanates out of there but there's also clear water. These Indians would come in their little green wagons and bring a lot of saddle horses with them and they would race them for the benefit of the local miners and then the local people would buy saddle horses from these Indians. If I remember right, a lot of the going price was only $5.00 for a horse. We would know in advance when the horses were going to return and we'd be lined up along the road there in Winter Quarters. Wait all day and pretty soon they would come up the road tied nose to tail and some of the mares would have had new colts that the owners hadn't seen. Then there was a few days of trimming manes and tails and shoeing horses and then the kids could ride the horses until their hearts content. They could put hobbles on them and they could find plenty of
feed along the hill there for the summer months.
I remember the dark night when Jack Dempsey lost to
10

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
Gene Tuney which we thought was a raw deal even though we didn't see the fight. And if I remember right, round by round was either telegraphed directly from where the
fight took place or else was telegraphed and then phoned to the mine office at Winter Quarters. Because as I remember they knew on a round by round basis how the fight was coming along. Of course later we went to Scofield and saw the silent movies and saw what a superior boxer Gene Tuney was. It was also a sad day when the silent movie idol, Rudolph Valentino, died. There were a lot of broken hearts. As I remember, I think it was ruptured appendix.
The Wasatch Store at the top of the canyon was the center of the community and they sold quality merchandise from about everything from groceries, to meats, to clothing. At Christmas there would be a display of toys in the front window. It wasn't a very wide store. And they were pretty much basic. There would be a dapple gray rocking horses, red wagons, flexible flyer sled, and for the girls, dolls, dishes, miniature doll house, and clamp on ice skates for both sexes.
Sometimes, the circus or carnival would come to that part of the country and they would set up in a grassy, triangular shaped piece of ground, just north of the big red water tank in Scofield where the rail engines would
11

 W AL TER MORGAN DONALDSON
fill up with water. My dad used to tell about the first time that the merry-go-round came to Scofield when he was a kid, and he said the people went so crazy over it they run almost all night and the kids had a hard time getting on the merry-go-round because once the older people got on they wouldn't get off. He also reminded me that at
that time that Scofield did not have a water system but they had wells in their backyards. Winter Quarters had piped water down through town. It seemed to me like we had an outside faucet for a while, then they brought it inside; although in the early days when my grandparents lived up there they had to carry water from the creek for their washing. In their day there was also a lot of wild raspberries along the Winter Quarters Creek. So many of them that they used to put them up in bottles. There used to be a spring coming out of the mountain on the south side of the canyon. It was cemented in and was ice cold and pure and the pipe was raised above the creek several feet and on the other side of the creek you could get a cold drink because it ran night and day. The coldest water I've ever tasted.
We didn't have radios in those days, but everybody had a phonograph. I can remember we had a little rosewood Edison that cost $200.00. It had a gold needle and you didn't have to replace it, and the records looked like
12

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
they were about a half inch thick. The first radio I heard was at Lee Thomas' place, who was my uncle. And as I remember, we had to listen one at a time by putting sets on our ears. The holidays in the summer would sometimes be celebrated by building a bowery out of quaking aspen just out of town where we would have homemade lunches and ice cream made in a hand made
MT:
WD:
freezer.
Sometimes the baseball game between Winter Quarters
would end in fist fights. As a matter of fact, more than likely that was the end of the ball game. We had a little hospital but babies were born at home. When there was a new arrival the older kids were hustled out of bed in the middle of the night, sent to a neighbor or a friend until the baby had been delivered by the doctor. We loved this little community and it was a sad day when the mine closed in 1928. My dad believed that the mine would reopen in the fall and thought this so strongly that they came along and cut the power out so we didn't have any lights. We had to go to Gorisheks' Store in Scofield to buy some coal oil lamps. They also put boards on the windows and we still lived in the house. Finally in September realized they were not going to reopen.
Now how old were you then?
I was eight years old. This was 1928. And so this ended
13

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
four generations of the Donaldson family in the Scofield/W inter Quarters area. My grandmother Donaldson, who was a widow, also came from Pennsylvania with the children when they moved up there. I was just thinking as a sidelight that they didn't have a mortician in the area. When I had a little sister die in 1928 or '27, I don't remember which, we had a neighbor who was something of a carpenter so he made a tiny casket and lined it with
some kind of thick material. I can still remember this. And we had to have a real quick funeral because there was no mortician. So in September of 1928, we moved from Winter Quarters to Castle Gate and I wasn't in love with Castle Gate, maybe we didn't stay there too long. Between September, from September through December we lived in Castle Gate and Helper and the thing I remember about Helper was they probably had the meanest kids and the toughest kids that I've ever met in my life. I can remember that some of the kids--it seemed to me like we went from the 1st to the 9th grade, if I remember correctly. I was in the 3rd and some of the older boys
looked like they were old enough and big enough to work in the mine, but I'd see those kids get in fights out in the yard, that was so serious that Mr. Horsley, the principal, had to come out with a piece of 3I 4- inch garden hose and beat them like you would a couple of
14

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
bulldogs to get them quit. Of course, one of the things that kept that going was that not far from the Central School in Helper was the old Liberty Theater where they used to have prize fights. It seemed like it was on
MT WD:
Friday night they had a ring in there and course in those days you used to see posters on all the telephone poles and one thing another would be boxers from around the state of Utah who would be coming to fight. Boxing was a big thing in Carbon County. In those days, most miners bought their kids a pair of boxing gloves at Christmas and he'd expect to have them worn out by the next Christmas.
I don't remember very much more about Winter Quarters covered that haven't we. Along to Castle Gate. That was quite a shock to go to Castle Gate because that was a big mining camp. They had three mines in operation and the school was bigger and the town was bigger and we almost felt lost.
You felt like you'd moved to the city, right?
We felt like we'd moved to the big city. Anyway, what did
I do with my, oh here we go.
MT: This is a great story. When we--you've answered all my
questions. I had a whole list of questions.
WD: When we went to school at Helper, actually we lived in Martin, which is just, I guess you'd call a suburb north
15

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
of Helper and I remember that we lived next to the Giolotti family. They owned a grocery store there made of stone and I remember that Mrs. Giolotti had a big brick oven in her backyard and she used to bake a french type of bread and that's the first time I heard the word pizza, but it wasn't the fancy pizza we have today. All
it was was a thin piece of bread dough with whatever was in season. If tomatoes were in season, had tomatoes and peppers on hand, whatever else that you put on it. And our bus from, there were so few of us who lived in Martin, that our bus was a little half ton Dodge truck. Like one of these little paddy wagons you used to see in Moon Mullins or some of them in the funny papers years ago. With nothing more than a maybe three quarter ton pick-up with wire sides and then canvas over the sides, and there was benches on each side for us to ride in.
We left Helper and moved to Consumers in January of 1928 and we were delighted to move to Consumers. And a, we liked this little town from the first day we moved there. The truck carrying our furniture couldn't make it any further than the old Blue Blaze Store. From there the furniture was transported to a bobsled and there was a Mr. Rich, who was the barn boss. I can remember that he had a company team and hauled our furniture up through Consumers Canyon. My younger brother Bob and I rode the
16

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
runners. As you got just about to the top of the canyon, where I think they call Fan Canyon now, my dad pointed across the canyon and said "Boys, there's your new home, and there was a row of army type square tents like we had in 1941 in the army. They had board sides, maybe three feet high, and a board floor. We unloaded the furniture and my dad set up the little coal cooking range, which provided heat and for my mother to cook on. He ran a piece of wire across the tent and then my mother put up
some white bed sheets and this, I don't know what separation this made. We ate in half of it and slept in the other half of it. I don't remember why ... it's been too long ago.
Nobody wanted to tell my mother that we tipped the bobsled over coming up and knocked a piece out of the lid of her washer, which was never repaired. It was a nice Maytag washer. In the winter the snow was deep and with the canyon lined with tents it looked just like the movies we now see of the gold rush days of Alaska. There was tents along mostly the upper part of the canyon and lower down there were what we called tar paper shacks which were a little nicer. And later on a nice masonry apartment was built in the bottom of the canyon where people lived. In the bottom one was a small doctors' office. When we lived in the tent, sometimes, well my dad
17

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
would always get up early to go work and check the area, because sometimes the power lines would blow down during
the night and he was afraid that we were going to get electrocuted with the power running into the snow. They had a real problem keeping the water line from freezing up. They had a spring at the top of the canyon which furnished the water. So they would have to hire a man to keep coal out on top of the water line in the canyon to keep it thawed out, which made it ideal for the kids to sleighride because the water line run right along the
road so we could stop and get warm anytime we wanted to. The outhouse was really something when we lived in that tent. In those days the quakies came right down to the bottom of the canyon on the north side of the outhouse there was a revelation. There was a place where four quakies had grown to form a square. They simply wrapped a piece of mine brattice around it which is about the same kind of material that gunny sacks were made out of and the door was fashioned with a large bent nail. I don't remember whether it had a top on it or not. I think
that my dad had to put a top on it of some kind. But anyway, that was something to read about.
The water was in taps along the road in front of the tents. I don't remember how far apart they were, but I do remember that they must have been a little ways because
18

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
in the winter time the miners wives would have five gallon cans and we would fill these cans full of water and would haul them to the miners' wives for them to use. However, this was the only experience of pioneering we had in the mining camps of Carbon County. Before that we'd always lived in a nice house and we'd always had nice furniture. This was not typical of mining camp life. Now the reason for this Alaskan type atmosphere was
simply the fact that Consumers was a new camp. They hadn't had time to build homes. And also there was a great demand for coal at that time.
The school was really something. My first day at school I couldn't concentrate. As I remember, we had four grades in one room. One teacher and four rows of desks. So while one row was reciting or doing something orally or maybe even singing a song, the other three rows were trying to concentrate and it was an impossible situation. We had a good teacher, but nobody could handle that.
After that we moved to Standardville. We had a good school and although I'd been a good student, I was so far behind the principal was very concerned. He came to our home taking a census or something and told my mother it looked like they were going to have to demote me and because I'd always had a lot of pride in being a good student, I remember our stove sitting kitty corner in the
19

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
corner, kitchen stove, and I crawled behind the stove and started to cry. He heard me crying so he told my mother that he would work some special assignments and work with me and try to save me. So we did that and two years later I represented the school at the county spelling contest which was held in the high school and there was no separation of grades. It was the fifth grade on through high school. I was quite lucky too. I guess I got a good choice of words and done quite well, and as a reward he
MT: WD:
took me to my first meal in a restaurant, called Mickey's Place in Price. I think it would be just east of the Price Theater and I can even remember what I had that day. I had a roast pork, hot roast pork sandwich, and apple pie with ice cream on it and I remember how self- conscious I was because I was eight years old and had never eaten in a restaurant before.
That's great.
We had very fine teachers in every mining camp . . . . They were dedicated men and they wanted to do everything they could. And my parents used to say to us that you got to behave yourself and my dad would say "You get a crack in the school and you're gonna get another when you come horne. These people are there to help you kids pull yourself up by your own bootstraps and get out of the mines." So we didn't come horne with any sad tales about
20

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
school and they expected us to work. In connection with the school in Consumers, the--not dwelling on the outhouses, but the one in the tent was luxury hotel compared to the ones they had at the school. They had two outside toilets. They were framed but they didn't keep them cleaned out and half the time there'd be a coat of ice coming up through the hole that you couldn't use them anyway and every time I'd go in there I'd get sick. I guess everybody else did. I don't know why they weren't
cleaned up, I don't know the answer to that.
There were quite a few single men around the mining camps in those days and it required two boarding houses in Consumers; one at the bottom of the canyon and then Luke Milich, an Austrian fellow and his wife had a boarding house at the top of the canyon. A lot of the Austrians stayed there. My mother's two brothers stayed there because the food was better than it was any place
else.
During our first winter, I only remember of two
radios in Consumers. There might have been more but I'm not aware of them. Luke Milich had one and because my uncle stayed there I was allowed to go up once a week and have the "Arizona Wranglers," I think it was on Thursday night for a half hour. And then George Smith lived in the end apartment upstairs in the permanent masonry
21

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
apartment, and we would sleighride half the night going up and down the hill and when it carne time for "Amos and Andy" we'd gather in a circle around the front of his apartment. He would open the window, even though it was wintertime, wide open and turn the radio on full blast
and we'd get to hear 11Amos and Andy11 , didn't have a radio at horne.
even though we
There was no entertainment as I remember. At this time, there were no organized sports. There was no baseball diamond, there was no bowling alley, no place to play basketball, no gym. We hiked up into beaver country in the summer and then went sleighriding in the winter. I think the people were starved for entertainment. They must have been because when the miners were changing shifts they would sit around the steps in their mine clothes at the old Blue Blaze store and they would pay us boys to fist fight for them. So they must have been pretty hard up for entertainment. I can remember I went horne one day and I got the worst end of it; I was black and blue all over, and I thought that I was going to get some sympathy. My mother looked at me and said, "You been swearing again, haven't you?11 So I didn't get any sympathy at horne.
Work was good in 1929 and '30. I heard my dad say those two winters he hardly ever saw the daylight. One
22

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
month he made $200.00 because of the overtime, which was a lot of money in those days. Although some of the

cutting operator and cutting machine operators working on contract made several times that much during those years. They made a lot of money. But a lot of them also practically worked themselves to death and suffered with rheumatism and other ailments that came from just working too hard over a long period time.
What did your father do in the mine?
He was what you call a "nipper". About what a railroad brakeman is on the railroad. Couples cars together when they bring the coal cars in.
And how were they moving the coal cars?
They had a few horses in the mine. They also had gabby motors but the main line they had big electric motors to pull the coal out and so it moved pretty fast.
And this was in the early '30s?
Uh-huh. Before the '30s. Still in the '20s. We lost a lot of time because of contagious diseases. A lot of school time rather. If a member of the family contacted whooping cough, the mumps, or small pox or chicken pox, they put a large sign on our door which read "QUARANTINED" and the kids had to stay in there until all the kids had either had the disease or been cleaned up. So if you had a big
family it was possible that you could be quarantined all 23

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
winter. One winter we were just about quarantined all winter. It was pretty hard to keep our school work up.
MT: Was your dad quarantined?
WD: No. They let the mother and father go out. I don't know
why. The company issued script in those days which was their own money. You could draw this out, I think it was $5.00 and $10.00 denomination. They were small, silver brass colored coins about the size of a dime, and you could draw these out in the middle of the month without waiting for payday. The office and the store was in the same building. You had to leave the office to walk around in the store. Since I was the oldest boy and sometimes it was hard walking down that steep hill in the snow. I would do a lot of the family shopping even though I was only eight and haul the groceries on my sled. In walking around from the office to the store one day, I drew out $5.00 and lost it and I really felt bad about it because that just about a day's wages for my dad. We never found it.
Many miners were injured during this period when they were rushing for coal. The tragedy was always near us with death or one thing and another. I remember I was standing in front of the store one day and the mine was just a couple hundred feet from the store. Everything was right together. A miner came out and was going into the
24

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
office to pick up a stretcher and somebody ask him who was hurt and the man gave my father's name. So I ran up to the mine and when they brought my dad out on the
MT:
WD:
MT: WD: MT: WD:
stretcher I trotted alongside the men from the mine to the hospital. My dad received serious back injuries that bothered him until the day he died. So we was always close to things of that kind.
We left Consumers in June of 1930, with mixed emotions, and moved to Standardville.
I wanted to ask you Walt, how did your family live when your father was injured like that? Did you have savings? I would suppose that we had compensation. I'm pretty sure we did.
Oh there was compensation that early on?
Yeah. I think.
In the '30s?
I don't remember. This would be about 1929, but I would think this was the case. Then the moving to Standardville was a drastic change again. I was ten years old and in the fifth grade and then, this was a model mining camp. Stucco homes, frame homes, large company lawns that were kept up full-time by a man hired to do it. It had a nice
school. Well staffed, good teachers. Large amusement hall with hardwood floors. We played basketball. See the movies every Sunday night and every other Sunday was free
25

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
with a matinee in the afternoon and an adult show at night. Underneath the amusement hall was a confectionery where they had a big nice marble bar where they sold ice
cream and soft drinks, candy, and they also had a railway express office and a barber shop. There was a tennis court with night lights and this was a busy place in the summer because the kids were allowed one night a week to play games. They could do anything we wanted as long as they didn't get out of hand.
As we started high school, we got to know the Spring Canyon kids. So we were allowed to attend their movie on Thursday night, which was free every night. They had four movies a month and they were all free. Spring Canyon also had the only swimming pool up the canyon. Standard and Latuda were very short on water and all of our drinking water we had to haul from Helper. Merrill Bryner built a little room in his service station on Bryner street and all that was in there was a tap where we would fill up our two five gallon water cans that we put on the floor of our car. So every time we went to town, no matter how many kids we had, you had two five gallons of water on the back floor and the kids had to sit with their feet propped up on the water cans. But Merrill Bryner was very considerate that way. Sometimes if we went swimming at Spring Canyon they would let us in and sometimes they
26

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
wouldn't. It would depend on who was in charge that day. Clair Neuren was one of those who always let us in but I won't mention the names of those who wouldn't let us in.
It doesn't make any difference anyhow.
Later on the welfare association bought us a season
ticket to Helper so for several years we could come to Helper and swim anytime we wanted, except we had t o f i nd our own ride. They also provided balls and bats and the catcher's equipment so that we could join the, I don't know what we called it then, it's like a little league now. All the businesses in Helper had a team and the mining camps had a team. And we had to find our own way to that. Although the people were awful good about giving us a ride. Nobody ever passed up a kid on the road. We didn't have, we were very trusting kids, as were our parents, we didn't have the terrible things happening then that we have now. You could trust people to give a
kid a ride. You didn't have to worry about them.
One thing that a lot of people realize about Carbon County in those days was they always depict miners as men in working clothes, mining clothes. But the truth is that
the miners of Carbon County were probably the best dressed men in the State of Utah. One of the reasons for this is that every year there would be a salesman come from the National Tailors in Chicago and they would visit
27

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
every mining camp store in Carbon County and he'd have these bolts of real fine material and everybody wore tailor-made suits. They were tailor-made and after you were measured in a few weeks you would get your suit in a box and you had a check off system at the mine so you
could pay so much a month and the first suit I ever owned was my graduation suit in 1938. My dad paid $32.00 for it and he paid it off at the rate of $3.00 a month on the check off system. Of course that represented quite a bit of money in those days.
I also recall that when my parents carne to a movie in Helper my dad carne in a full dress suit and a white shirt and a hat. My dad never dressed up without a hat. In fact, many times, my parents and a lot of other men, even when they just come to Workmen's Market or some place in Helper to shop, the women were all dressed up and the men carne in a full dress suit. And I think a lot of people that didn't live here are not aware of some of these things.
The labor trouble we had in about 1933 is probably best forgotten. It wasn't so much between the company and the men, but between the two factions, United Mine Workers and the National Miners who wanted to represent the men. I remember that feelings were so high about this and that some families in the county went on for years.
28

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
I remember that one of the first assemblies we went to in high school we were told that we didn't want the strike to be mentioned in any programs because they didn't want the rancor of a lot of people.
We always had a lot of celebrations on the 4th of July. Sometimes, every year was a Standard Day. One year they really done it up big by coming to the Helper Park and they had some restaurant in Price who helped cater the meal and big long tables and they brought the food to us. But generally it was held between the bandstand and the store in the amusement hall where there was a straight piece of road in there and we had to put races and sack races. There was tubs of soda water covered with
ice and ice cream sundaes and bars and a kid could have all he wanted. In those days we'd like to done ourself in. And the main event of this Standard Day was always a tug of war on the tennis court between the inside miners and those on the outside. Cash prizes were given for first, second and third events.
The store and butcher shop were like they were in most mining camps. The store and butcher shop were together and in Standardville it also contained the post office. This was the center of activity in the town. The thing I remember about the store was all the canned goods
on the shelf and downstairs they kept the hardware and
29

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
they kept vinegar in big wooden barrels to keep it cool. Most of the other clothing and the sporting goods were kept in the upstairs. There was a basement and then two floors above that. There was no help yourself service. The clerks always waited on you and put the stuff on the counter for you. I remember the cheese didn't come as we get it now. Cheese came in a big, like an inner tube or a tire, except I'd say it was about 18 inches or two feet
through and maybe six inches thick and you could move this around by little clicks and so many clicks was a pound and then you'd pull the blade down and you'd get a piece of cheese shaped like a piece of pie. Most of us had to charge at the company store. In those days we couldn't get ahead.
Whatever you worked they would take out for your rent and your union dues, the bathhouse, welfare association. Whatever other donations first; then whatever was left after that then you could have it for groceries. And this welfare association wasn't what we associate with welfare; it just meant that the welfare association was a case where everyone had, I think it was dollar and a half a month, deducted from the wages. And then this money was used to pay for the holidays and free shows and things of that kind. So it was a voluntary deal. But anyway, as far as the store was concerned after
30

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
you had these things, your expenses paid up there would be, I guess they would telephone the men's time in at night. The next morning the truck would come in from Salt Lake and it would have what we called the "red list" and
this would tell you if you had, in some cases no credit, or you might have five or ten cents. If you had ten cents you could get a little bit of sugar to go with your bread or whatever you were making. And I remember that being the oldest boy, it was always my job to go find how much credit we had. I was so embarrassed about this, not realizing everybody else in town was going through the same thing, I'd hang around the store until there was nobody in there then run in and ask them what the credit was. But I realize how foolish that is now.
Bands were the big thing in Carbon County in the early '30s and up into the mid '30s. Most of the junior highs had little bands where they would compete. These bands would be fed into the high school where the band director could take his pick of the people. He had a lot of kids to choose from. They had so many kids that they had a first band and a second band and they were both large. As I remember, Carbon High School won first place at the World's Fair in Chicago for marching in about 1933. The annual spring band contest in Price was one of the big musical events in the western part of the United
31

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
States, where bands competed for marching and in concert. Carbon High was the high school in those days that all of the bands were judged by in the state. They would always march last and when they came down the street they
couldn't keep the street cleared because the local residents wanted to go out and mob them. Also the Rio Grande Railroad in Helper had a band all made up of young men and they represented the railroad. I was a member of it. And they paid our transportation around to different places in the West and fed us on the train, in the dining car. This band was directed by William Toy. He used to be a musician in the old silent movies in Price, playing the piano. And we had a lot of fun in this band and we were good enough that in whatever year they had the San Francisco World's Fair we were invited to play at the World's Fair.
The only church I remember being in Standard was a small LDS branch that met in the amusement hall. And the classes were not partitioned, so you got whoever's
message had the loudest voice that day. Later the company gave them the boarding house which was no longer in use and they converted this into rooms and painted it and kept it clean and it was real nice.
Christmas Eve was the big event of the year. The entire town assembled and we had a big Christmas tree and
32

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
musical numbers from the school. Each kid would receive a gift worth about $3.00, which was a lot of money in
those days. They would put each family's present in one box and our box was generally so big that I couldn't carry it. They would also receive a big stocking with quality candy and nuts, an apple and an orange, and in those days an orange was a rare commodity, a real delicacy.
They were very close in the mining camps. With all of our religions and nationalities, we really didn't care how you spelled somebody's name or how you pronounce it. We grew up without thinking a thing about that. In 1938 I had a brother who was, I think 14, who was killed in a hillside accident just southwest of Standard in what we called Maple Creek Canyon. Some kids were up after a Christmas tree for the hall and a rock rolled downhill and hit him in the head. There wasn't any place big enough in town to hold a funeral so the only place that could have it was in the amusement hall and this was only about two weeks before Christmas. They had the hall all decorated and the big Christmas tree was all lit up with lights and, it may sound kind of strange to talk about it now, really, we didn't think much about it because there was a good spirit there. We felt the love of the people. The men were good enough they got up at three or four
33

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
o'clock in the morning, the day shift, and went to work several hours early so the night shift could go in early and all the miners come out of the mine and we had the funeral after dark which is also unusual. But there was nothing else we could do about it. I might say, because of the good spirit there and we knew that our neighbors
felt for us, why everything came out fine.
Frank Markosek, Sr. lived across the canyon, as did
quite a few Austrians, and they built a bocco cart, and bocco is something like bowling except you don't hit pins, you hit little balls. All they did was level off a piece of ground. They didn't have hard surface and wet the dirt and packed it good and they put lights up and sometimes they would have Rudy Christman or some accordion player come up to Helper and have a lot of music and kielbasa and all those things, and us kids would be glad to set things up for them so we could have all we wanted of that good bohunk food.
We became close to the kids in junior high school because Latuda had the only junior high, above Standard, and the junior high was attended by kids from Standardville, Latuda, Rains, Mutual, and L ittle Standard, seven to the ninth grade.
The Japanese miners were kind of a unique group. They lived in a narrow canyon on the south side of
34

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
Standard and they kept pretty much to themselves. The only married man there was what we called the "Jap boss." He worked in the mine and ran the operation and his wife done the cooking and whatever had to be done. They also had a little pool hall where they played billiards and
cards and we were allowed to go there to buy candy or pop. It was only, the place was probably only 50 feet from one of the houses we lived in. They had a little shooting scrape there at one time among themselves but Sheriff Bliss came up but he didn't get any information out of them. When he left he didn't have any more
information than when he came.
Prosperity started to return in the late '30s when
they worked the low seam mines up the canyon. They had a good grade of coal and most of the mining camp boys did not go to college in those days. Most of us went to work and were absorbed by the mine where we lived. We went right to work where our fathers had worked.
MT: What job was your father doing at this time in the mine? Did it change when he went to Standardville?
WD: No. He was a truck driver outside and later he ran the outside hoist, so he had a good job. And I worked on the tipple at Standard and Latuda and Castle Gate for, I think a little better than $4.00 a day, and then I got a job inside at Rains for $6.78 a shift and believe me you
35

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
really earned it. But that $6.78 was a far cry from $2.10 for ten hours work I got for digging the manway with a pick and shovel under the Helper rail yards. There was myself and Robert Lambert, Cecil and Woodrow Pierson and Martin Ganser, and that gave me work to go to school that fall. I heard there was going to be some openings and I went to the depot and I think I talked to the yardmaster and he said "You're not old enough to work, you're only 16 years old," and I said, "Yeah, but the Depression's on and I come from a big family and I really need a job."
So, I'm about 100 years old on Rio Grande Railroad records, I had to do a little fibbing there on the papers.
The county had fallen away, a lot of homes had been moved out. I remember that I played with Dominic Bonnaci's band and at the Old Silver Moon. We went up to play for a dance at Sunnyside one night and it was so dark we had to knock on a door and ask them where the amusement hall where we were to play.
MT: They didn't have street lights?
WD: Well, if they had them they must have been few because we
couldn't find our way. Later on, Gans Durrant who had been the chief clerk up there at that time was in the hospital, and I talked to him and he was telling me that he went fishing on one weekend and when he came back
36

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
somebody had moved a house out of Sunnyside without paying for it and to that day they had never found it. So a lot of funny things took place.
MT: So what instrument did you play, Walt?
WD: The saxophone and clarinet. Speaking of dancing, dancing
was a big thing in Carbon County. There were several big bands and several small bands.
Ok, I think I mentioned last about most of us didn't have steady girlfriends, we'd load up a group of boys and start at Standardville and go to Spring Canyon and Castle Gate and Kenilworth and we'd just dance a few times with the girls that we knew at the high school. We had a lot of good clean fun in those days. Then in March of 1941, A lbert Cook and B ill Somppi of Helper and myself went into the army and nine months later World War II started and so we didn't come back for almost five years. I worked from about October of '45 to march of '46 and then married a girl from Arizona and moved down there. I come back to Standardville and worked the winter of 1952 and then I went to Spring Canyon Mine from '52 to '58 and then I quit the mine and went into insurance. My memories of Standardville and all the other mining camps are very pleasant memories.
MT: Now that is just wonderful. Will you answer just a few questions?
37

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON WD: If I can.
MT:
WD:
MT:
WD: MT: WD:
I'm sure you can. I think of your mom. How many children were in your family?
There were nine children and we lost this little girl in Winter Quarters and my brother was killed, so my mother actually raised seven children.
So how was it when she lived in Standardville? Did she have many conveniences?
Oh yes.
Was it much different from living where you were then? Oh yeah. Consumers was bad. When we lived in Standardville we had good circumstances. I was thinking of another thing about service. My brother went up to Hill Field to work after he got out of high school. My mother had always wanted I think you call them a mint colored overstuff set and so my brother came down; my mother didn't know about this, my brother come down to what's Tina Skerl's store?
Oh Mutual.
Mutual. Yeah. And ordered this overstuff set and by golly they delivered it to her home on Christmas Day. Can you
imagine a businessman leaving his business, and of course my mother was--
Only John Skerl. Only John Skerl would do that.
But that's the service that we used to get in Carbon
MT: WD:
MT:
WD:
38

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
Scones you call them now I guess. Living in the coal camp a lot of the times the kids, in the summertime, you'd have to go along the railroad track and pick up coal that had fallen off the cars to cook supper. Even though coal was probably less than $2.00 a ton. That didn't last very
MT: WD: MT:
WD:
MT:
long. That was a couple of summers.
But that was a rough time?
Oh yeah.
The mines weren't working? When did the mines begin to pick up? Was it around '40?
No. It was before that because they was working pretty good when I went in the mine. I would imagine about '36 that they probably started to pick up a little.
So what do you think the conditions were in the mines that caused some of those early strikes? I understand there was the differences among the men between the two mines, the United Mine Workers and National Miners Union. They had caused a lot of animosity. But they did get together, right?
In the end everybody joined United Mine Workers and well, one of the reasons, some of the reasons that they wanted better conditions was that the company owned the house you lived in and if you lost your job you lost your home. It wasn't like down here where if you lose your job you stay in your house and go some place else. You lost your
WD:
40

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
job you had to leave town. Things like that they had pretty good control over you.
MT: What about working conditions in the mine? Was that an issue in those early strikes?
WD: Oh. It was. I think maybe they got a little careless because of lack of material in the Depression years. I didn't work in the mine during the Depression. At the
time I went in the mine they were starting to pull out of the Depression. They had plenty of material and things were pretty good.
MT: And how old were you when you started in the mine?
WD: I started when I was 18. Went to work for the coal companies as soon as I got out of high school and I
worked there until I went into the army.
MT: But there were a lot of younger boys in the mine with
their father before that?
WD: No. This was clear back in the old days when my dad was
working. By the time I come along they had truant
officers and the kids had to go to school.
MT: And you had to go to school?
WD: Yes.
MT: That's interesting.
WD: They may have let some of the kids out on hardship cases.
They may have went to work at 16 or something. They expected you to stay in school until you were 18.
41

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
MT: But during that time, kids weren't allowed?
WD: N o .
MT: Ok, so it goes back farther than that?
WD: Yeah.
MT: The only thing I wanted to ask you; in the coal camps,
generally speaking, did they have any kind of council or government that the people participated in or were all the rules made by the company? How did they handle that?
WD: Every place I lived the coal company owned the whole camp so as far as I know there wasn't any council.
MT: So if there were any rules in the camp, the company made them?
WD: Yeah. And then, as far as the rule and the treatment was concerned, it was like it is any place else. You depend on the men. If you had a decent man that was in charge of the camp, the superintendent, why you were treated right. If you got a guy who was a burn, that's the way he treated you. But you didn't have any control over it because, like I say, you lived in their house and you didn't have any union back in those days. So it just depends on who's in charge.
MR: Right. What kind of person?
WD: Uh-huh.
MT: Do you feel that living in mining camps and living among
people with many different backgrounds, religious, and
42

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
their customs, and their different values coming in, wasn't Standardville, didn't they have a lot of people from different countries?
WD: Yes.
MT: Do you feel in some ways that influenced your life in a
way that, say you wouldn't have been influenced if you
had lived any other place?
WD: Well, I think we grew close to kids and kids sometimes
talk more than their parents do. I think we got to know how they felt. The influence, of course, I used to tell my dad when I get married, you don't know how to make sausage like the bohunks and Italians, and the first thing I'm gonna do when I get married is get me a meat grinder. And I did. I made Italian sausage and that ever since we've been married and my kids love it. Some of the kids whose dads made it from those countries where it was popular, they didn't follow-up; but I did. We make this sausage all the time. So those little things they become a part of your family.
MT: Exactly. Part of your own heritage .
WD: Their culture is something that you accept. You take the
best you want from all of them and boy if you keep your eyes open you can learn a lot from these people, no matter where they come from. I learned that a long time ago.
43

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
MT: That's great. That's great. So, when you have your
reunion with the people from Standardville, is that the
one that you're going to have this summer? WD: Yeah.
MT: Do you get a lot of people come to those?
WD: We don't know. This is the first one. A lot of us has talked about it, but this Standard Day, the people that started this was Vonda Buckley and Shirley Tatton. They were both daughters of Ernest and Mildred Toson. I talked to Shirley one day where she worked and said, "Some day the old Standard people ought to gather, and if you ever want to do something you can use my office to meet and I'll do anything to help you." A few days later I got a call and she said, "We think we ought to do something about this." After we got together, we found out that
there were so few really old time Standard people left, that we would include the whole canyon, so then we called in people from Spring Canyon, Latuda, and all over. We decided to have it for the whole canyon.
MT: So how have you contacted people?
WD: We put articles in the paper and then when we met in our
office we made up lists, took several weeks, of all the people we could remember and then each camp took responsibility of finding all the people they could. And it's not going to be a big thing like programs and foot
44

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
races and all this kind of stuff. We're just going to have, like we're doing here today, we're gonna have a representative from each one of those mining camps get up and talk about the mining camp life and see how it goes. And then if they want another one, they can say what they want to have in the day and somebody else can take over. But, we're looking forward to it. I think we'll enjoy it.
MT: Oh I think that is wonderful. I just need to ask you one more question here. I just want you to know I was doing my homework. You answered all those questions. It was
really wonderfully done, Walt. This is what I wanted to ask you. At one time I understand there were about 5,000 people lived up that canyon. That would include all of the camps. What happened that all of those mines closed down and now when we go up there we just see a few old buildings?
WD: Well, I imagine that to start with the people switched over to gas and that done away with a lot of that business. In the wintertime up the canyon, a lot of that coal used to go up into the Northwest to heat homes. That's why we could always count on a good winter, maybe from September until the end of the early spring. And then mechanization come along and replaced many men and then I guess competition with other kinds of, maybe open pit mines, I haven't been close to industry, but it was
45

 WALTER MORGAN DONALDSON
a gradual thing, it didn't happen overnight. Just a little bit at a time.
So when did you move out of Standardville?
My folks, I enlisted in the army in 1941. My folks stayed there until 1949 and moved to Salt Lake and they never went back again.
And then when you came back from the army?
MT: WD:
MT: WD:
MT:
WD: MT: WD:
I worked for one winter and then I worked later for a few years up to Standard and Spring Canyon.
What, when you think of living in the mine camps, what do you think is the most important thing to you?
I think that we were all so close together.
Has that continued to this day?
Yeah. Oh yeah. Well, I think, like the case of my brother getting killed, or other tragedies, I don't know that there was any organized effort of any kind but you had a death in the family, the next day you had so much food brought to your house you didn't know what to do with it. Little things like that, like say, with all these different backgrounds we were all very close people. Well, on that note, we'll stop unless you have something else to add. This is a--
No. They were very fine people.
Wonderful county. I can vouch for that.
