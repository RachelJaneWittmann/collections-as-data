 THE FOLLOWING I S AN INTER VIEW WITH A . DEV AR SHUMWAY CONDUCTED BY CLARE ENGLE AT ORCHARD MESA, COLORADO ON JULY 22, 1970. [THIS IS PART OF THE UTAH URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT. TAPE #1.]
CE: Thank you very much for taking time to talk with me today, DeVar. And I'm going to call you DeVar if I may since we're going to be interviewing lots of Shumways and so that we can keep them all straight in our records. If you don't mind we'11 continue that way. I'm interested in recording your experiences as the leading contractor in the vanadium and uranium Industry on the Colorado Plateau, and as long time contractor for the [Union] Carbide Corporation. As you know, Union Carbide is my particular assignment and I do know that you've been with that or were with the organization as a contractor for about twenty years. But before we begin on your work will you tell me where you were born and raised and educated?
DS: I was born and raised in Blanding, Utah and educated to some extent down there. I did go to Utah State Agriculture College for two quarters and was also-- while I was in the Navy I went.to the--let's see, it was the North Dakota State School of Science at
Wattica, North Dakota or something. This was just a
machinist-mate school while in the Navy.
CE: I didn't know that North Dakota had any sea ways.
DS: Well, it wasn't the sea way, it was along the Red

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
River out there, but it was just a machinist-mate school that the Navy was using the facilities of the State School of Science there at Wattica, North Dakota. So, as far as education is concerned I'm not a mini;ng engineer nor a geologist, I mean I don't have a diploma of any kind. You want mostly then just the contracting, nothing to do with leasing and-- Part of that too, but tell me first of all about your days in Blanding when you were a young man going to high school. I told you about the article I read in the newspaper, the Salt Lake Tribune and then the San Francisco Chronicle in which the Shumways are mentioned as very prominent miners and prospectors in the forties and fifties and before that also.
CE:
DS: Well, my mining knowledge, the beginning of it at least was acquired during Cottonwood and while I was still going to high school. Most of the experience at mining, of course, would have been in the summertime. I did work in Cottonwood some, just high-grading with Dad and some of his brothers and on private leases and so forth, but also probably the first real mining
experience that I had there would have been working for Kimberly's prior to the Blanding mines. That was Howard Kimberly and his brother John Kimberly and a fellow by the name of James Blinkenstaff that was
2

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
sent over by Frank Garbid too. They eventually built a little mill. I worked on the mill and also worked in the mines and worked to some extent in the mill as a high school student during the summers that I was there. This was my first experience probably as I started off at $2 a day and eventually worked up to $4 a day. For awhile we were allowed to make our sixth ton of ore with hand steel. This was the mill site and all was made with hand steel; we didn't have any compressors, we had no jackhammers, and it was all hand steel that we built the mill site [with] and fed the mill with single-jack steel or with double- jack; that's one man turning the steel and another man that's swinging the hammer. The single-jack, you're turning the hammer. Usually if you're right- handed you turn the steel with your left hand and swinging your hammer with your right hand. This way we drilled our holes and with that kind of method we could call it a shift after producing six tons of ore on a shift, and I could do this in some of those places in about four hours, so I was allowed to empty a leach tank in the mill which is around fifteen tons of ore in the tank. They didn't have
flushing methods, they just shoveled it out. So with a scoop shovel and a wheelbarrow I could empty a
3

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
leach tank in another four hours, and this would give me eight hours, eight dollars' pay for about eight hours work, which is fifty cents an hour actually. But then I worked the following summer after that, part of the summer for this outfit and they didn't seem to be doing too well. I don't know whether it was the mill wasn't a success or just whether the process or what it was. Probably too small a plant, but anyway they got behind on their payment to us, which was eventually caught up. We all of us did get fully paid, but at that time it looked like maybe we wouldn't, so I got a set of hand steel and wheelbarrow and went over into Bradford Canyon and started to work on a mine there that there were no roads to. We had to wheel our supplies and everything in about three miles or something this way across canyons and so forth to get hand steel and dynamite and various supplies that we needed to work. In '38 and 139 I was working down there, and this was eventually sold to Fendel Setton. I think the ore was stockpiled in about forty-five days there. Ore that
was probably worth around $1,200 on today's prices. It would be quite a little more, but at that time we were only getting paid for vanadium, and where there wasn't even a road built to it. Union Carbide or the
4

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
old United States Vanadium at that sent some geologists in to measure the ore and assay it and then pay for it where they could build a road into it
later. These were pretty good mines. [They] had good faces of ore and it wasn't too difficult to [work] right from the rim workings. In fact, we hardly got underground. About that time I was called on a mission and used the money that I made off these mines and selling them and selling the ore to serve two years in South Georgia and West Florida as an LDS missionary. Then after I came back from the mission field I went to work down in South Cottonwood down with Merwin and Burdette Shumway on the Hangover claim. I don't know, we worked in several places. But anyway, we had a pretty good vanadium market to ship to the Montecello mill and we were making as much as three truckloads of ore a day. But at that time a truck load of ore was hauled on a two-ton truck that we'd maybe haul about five to seven tons to the trip or something this way. So actually we would only have been making about fifteen tons of ore a day or something this way.
CE: Was this during the metals reserve period? DS: Yes.
CE: When there was a bigger demand for vanadium?
5

 A . DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
DS: Yes. This would have been in about '43 or along about
that time. The later part maybe of '42 and the early part of '43 because I was drafted sometime in '43. I don't remember exactly when, I think probably in the
fall of '43, and it may have been the early part of '43, but anyway, I spent nearly three years in the Navy and then came out of the Navy and went back to work around the Big Hole area and some of the areas that we used to work for the Kimberlys for Frank Garbid. In the meantime, Blanding Mines had mined a lot of the ore out of that area. We went in some of their old workings and could make a little better wages selling vanadium along about that time, but because in the interest in the atomic bomb and atomic energy and the idea that maybe selling it we'd start getting paid for uranium, and knowledge that we had to some extent of mining the uranium and knowledge as where there might be a little of it and so forth, we were trying to keep mining operations together so that when the time came for maybe VAEC, which of course at that time we knew very little about, these government agencies and so forth as to who might be buying any ore, and of course didn't have any idea of the magnitude of what this might possibly go to, but we still wanted to because we knew we were on the
6

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
ground floor of this thing. [That is] why we wanted to stay in that business. At that time actually there wasn't very much in it, but then there wasn't much of anything for somebody just out of the Navy and so
forth to go to work at anyway. Considering.
What do you recall about Union Carbide and their role
CE:
in the Metals Reserve period from about '42 to 1 44? DS: Well, I don't know anything about Union Carbide's role in Metals Reserve. It seems like the one that we had anything to do with was maybe Page Edwards. Was
he in Metals Reserve? I think he was, and also-- CE: Christofsen.
DS: No, this wasn't the name. There was--well, I don't remember the name of this fellow that we were dealing with directly, but he was out of Monticello. Anyway, we had pretty fair contracts as far as--we were getting I think up to about forty-nine cents a pound for vanadium, which at that time or maybe any other time was more or less unheard of. We weren't getting
any uranium pay, but we didn't even know there was any value in the uranium unless it was on up in the percentage anyway. I wish I could remember the guy's name that we were dealing with in Metals Reserve, but anyway, it was more or less a government agency. We
still got paid from the mill there at Monticello. I 7

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
think VCA was running the mill under Metals Reserve or for Metals Reserve under a contract of some kind.
CE: United States Vanadium Corporation or Union Carbide was Metals Reserve Company's agent on the Colorado Plateau.
DS: Union Carbide was? Didn't VCA have any agency with them?
CE: Well, I think they worked very close together, the two companies.
DS: I'm sure that it was VCA personnel that was running the mill there at Monticello, and I think that probably the paychecks were to come from them but maybe they--Union Carbide would have been running a plant at Uravan. VCA I think also had a plant at Naturita that you could ship ore to, but our ore went to Monticello I think, purchased from VCA or by VCA as far as I know. It may be that I'm wrong in this, but we knew very little about the agencies and so forth. They'd come around and ask us how we were doing, and it seemed like anyplace that we wanted to
go to work they'd try and make it possible for us to
make it there.
CE: They encouraged the independent miner, the
prospectors?
DS: Yes. Yes, if you had any ore you could make a little
8

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
money on it at least. So we tried it in a number of places, but for some reason Cottonwood seemed to be the place we'd always come back to regardless of whether we went somewhere in Montezuma or whether we went up in Dry Wash or where we went, down Recapture
or anyplace that there was a little bit of vanadium around. It seems like you had to get back into the heart of things there at Cottonwood in order to get your next grubstake so that you could try it again somewhere away from there. This was true even after we'd go back from the service. We'd go several places and try it in San Juan County, within San Juan County part of Utah, and it seemed like we'd always come back to the Big Hole or back to the North Stinkin' Hole and the South Stinkin' Hole. These were terms that we gave them because of the ventilation problems that we had there. We had no blowers and would have got back in far enough that we couldn't wheel it anymore. We were mining with horse and carts. I suppose that you know something about what this was, it was just kind of a mine cart that we pulled by a horse. These horses got to be quite intelligent animals. They'd get to where you could go out and dump the cart for them into the bin or over the mud dump, and they'd go right back with a carbite light
9

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
on, go right back to the same place that you'd halted them last time and to the same [place,] turn around, and back the cart up so you could load it again from the same rock pile. Some of them got smart enough that they'd go that route. So--
You had a favorite one, didn't you?
Well, I did. Old Maude, a horse that I don't know what ever happened to her. but--
She went downhill Dr. Shumway said, with a load.
CE: DS:
CE: DS:
I wouldn't be surprised. It sounds like one of the stories that I heard. This happens to quite a few of them, especially to some people. I've never put a horse over the mud dump, but you have to realize that there's over a ton of material that a horse isn't capable of stopping, and unless you've got a good block there or something you can lose your horse and your cart and your ore and everything else. As long as you do realize this there's no reason for ever putting one over the hill.
But you started working for Carbide then, first selling to Carbide in the early forties.
You keep bringing up that it was Carbide that was the agent for Metals Reserve, and so if this is the case,
why yes. But I was thinking of--
But I--you mentioned Carbide just a few minutes ago.
CE:
DS:
CE:
10

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
That's why I brought this up.
DS: CE:
DS:
Oh, in a--
You said the horse would know the carbide light.
[Editor's note: Here the interviewer confused the horse's carbide mining lamp with Union Carbide.]
Oh, yeah. You're away from Metals Reserve times and-- no, let's see, it wasn't the early forties, it was--I never went with Union Carbide as a contractor until
'51. So there's time that's elapsed here between Metals Reserve time and the time that we got out of the service. Metals Reserve wasn't still in business after we got out of the service.
You must have got out about '45.
Yes. I got out in late '45. Well, I was in Tokyo Bay at the time that MacArthur signed the treaty there and I was on a destroyer. In fact, I was on destroyers most of the time in the Navy and had points enough to get out; we got out on the point system at that time. I'd been in long enough and seen enough action and so forth to have points enough to
get out. So I came back right after or soon after the treaty was signed. In fact, the way I remember it, I made it back in time for hunting season, before hunting season was over. However, I think it was what? In September sometime that the treaty was
CE: OS:
11

 A . DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
signed. I don't know, but it was in the fall there, late fall some time in '45 when I got out.
CE: How'd you feel when you found out that the area in which you grew up supplied the uranium that produced the atomic bomb?
DS: Well, I was quite sure of that and I told some of the guys--well, in fact the guys aboard ship had heard me talking about mining uranium and vanadium and so forth. When we first heard this that it was a bomb that was made up of uranium and so forth, I had no idea that this was kept secret enough by the Atomic Energy Commission or by whoever was purchasing ore and so forth that we never realized at the time that we were mining any strategic material of that kind. But I suspected after I heard that the bomb had been dropped on either Nagasaki or Hiroshima, one of the-- whichever dropped first. [Hiroshima] Then it was just two or three days later that they dropped another one, and at that time I was in the South Pacific and
we hoped that we had something going that would end the war. I also had ideas that if it was uranium that it would be of value for future wars or something this way and that I could get back home and maybe produce some more of it at a profit or maybe make it a lifetime occupation. I know that some of this did
12

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
go through the mines to some extent, so I was proud to hear of some of these things. Of course my
imagination maybe went wild sometimes as to where the material came from and as to how much more of it there was in the area where I was raised and whether there was any profit in mining it and so forth, but up until that time I had never done anything but mine as far as holding down a job with the exception of the one that Uncle Sam gave me in the Navy. So I kind of hoped that it would be something that I could go to work at when I got back.
CE: Well, you weren't around here then when Union Mines Development Company did their survey of the area to determine what the uranium reserves were. This would be from about '43 to '45.
DS: No. I wouldn't have been [there.] I was in the Navy at that time.
CE: Did you hear anything about it, any comments about Union Carbide's role again?
DS: From '43 to '45, this would be before the atomic bomb was dropped, and I don't think that Dad and his brothers or anybody that owned any uranium properties would have known of this investigation. I think it would have been kept entirely secret by Uncle Sam as far as possible at least. At least as far as I know
13

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
or as far as anybody knew there wasn't an atomic bomb in the making; there wasn't atomic energy. Of course you'd maybe hear something in college or something like this, that there's energy enough in a glass of water to run a freight train back and forth across the United states several times and things this way, which I guess potentially is so. The hydrogen in water--in a glass of water and so forth, and I
CE:
imagine that science knew something about the potential of uranium or the powers of the energy that could be derived form uranium, but the ordinary miner or the ordinary person in the service and so forth wouldn't have any idea of this. I think that this was kept secret enough that we wouldn't have known anything of Union Mines. You say their work in evaluating the reserves of the Colorado Plateau. Now I don't know who did the work nor how accurate it was. I can see now that it would have been very inaccurate because of the information that was known
at the time.
Do you remember any comments after you got back about the reports? It's very significant primarily because it was very inaccurate. They underestimated the
domestic reserves or the reserve specifically on the Colorado Plateau.
14

 A . DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
DS: Well, as far as that goes the Atomic Energy
Commission is underestimating their reserves today as to what they've got in their government blocks as we call them. The Atomic Energy Commission has withdrawn ground, or I guess actually it's Bureau of Land Management withdrawn for the Atomic Energy Commission. But they talk of 6,000,000 pounds of potential or of reserves that they call Positive Reserves, and yet I would say that they've got 6,000,000 pounds of Positive Reserves on the one block that they've got up there on Atchison Mesa alone. They've got 6,000,000 pounds I bet on the one that they've got on Monogram, and yet Union Carbide I think knows more about how much they¥ve got than they know themselves. A compilation of us contract miners, the knowledge that we've got from having mined up to these lines and so forth, we would know more about what they've got than what they know themselves.
CE: Do they use your knowledge? Does Union Carbide compile the information?
DS: Union Carbide compiles this information probably form their own knowledge. They have mining engineers that are assigned to any area that we're contract mining on, and so nobody takes our word--for what I mean as
15

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
a contractor's word for what there is left, but we've done the work and we've mined up to these places and we talked to others and so forth and know pretty well how much there is. But Union Carbide would have this down in pretty accurate figures. And--
That's their property?
CE:
DS: It's the properties that are around this AEC ground.
I say they'11 have pretty accurate figures on what the Atomic Energy Commission has got, because they're going to be the ones that will be running the ore through their plant. The way it looks right now there's no competition. If this ground is released now Union Carbide will get it all.
CE: You mean because they already own it?
DS: No.
CE: Because they can build it?
DS: They, they're the only ones that can buy it. The only
ones that would dare buy it. If I knew of a good property like I do know of several good properties down there, and had money enough to buy this property I certainly wouldn't invest in it 'cause I don't want a mill. And Union Carbide, if I bid against them [there's] no competition. They'll say, "Fine you've got several million dollars worth of ore. You sit there and look at it and admire it and you're not
16

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
going to work it through one of our mines," and so they would go ahead with their own business and let roe attend to what little dab of business I had there admiring all that ore that I had. They wouldn't necessarily have to buy it and probably wouldn't want to buy it after I bid against them. Then they could
also tell roe, "You're not going to mine it through our mines. You go up and run a million dollar shaft into that thing." Well, if I go up and run a million dollar shaft I still don't have any guarantee that they're going to buy it. So without competition none of us miners are going to bid against Union Carbide, and without competition none of these big oil companies, they don't have the same go at things that Union Carbide does anyway because they don't have any vanadium market. The vanadium market is tied up by VCA and Union Carbide and one or two other little outfits. Susquehanna's got some of it and one or two others have possibly got a small vanadium market, but it'd be insignificant. Actually, the only ones that are logical to come back in to compete against Union
Carbide would be VCA or Foote Mineral.
have probably 50% of the vanadium market in the 17
It's now Foote Minerals, isn't it?
CE:
DS: Yes. It's Foote Minerals. They have a good market or

 A . DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
United States or in the world as far as that goes.
CE: Well, are they competitors?
DS: They' re competitors, but in my opinion they' re big
brothers; they're still the same people. I think that some of the big stockholders of Union Carbide are also big stockholders in Foote Minerals and they're all drinking out of the same bottle in New York. They're more or less to some extent the same people and they're protecting one another. To some extent I think this is true, and certainly they've always got along real good.
CE: Well, what you say was brought out in the Nizely vs. Union Carbide breach that I read. I think I told you that I studied these and the anti-trust suit that was finally settled, concluded that this was true. These two companies were accused, and finally it was concluded that there was collusion there.
DS: Well, yeah. But wasn't this done before anti-trust laws came out that--they've had all of the vanadium market for about as long as I've been alive. I mean as long as from the time of my birth they've been in control of the vanadium market. I don't know as far as the Nizely report that you're talking about and the anti-trust suit and so forth, but still the fact remains that people like Climax run a uranium mill
18

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
for the government or under Atomic Energy supervision and so forth they were producing uranium in the Uravan mineral belt that was also producing vanadium but they had no market. The same way w ith A tlas and Moab. If they put in a vanadium circuit they've got to sell their ore to Union Carbide or to Foote Minerals, and after the black cake this is where a good share of the profits are made, is for Carbide to take this ore and make it into a caravan and sell it as a finished product, or for VCA to take the ore and sell it as pharovanadium, a finished product out of their plants in Ohio.
CE: Can't Atlas sell to another steel company who could make this into a finished product?
DS: I'm sure they can't. Atlas and Climax both of them sold to VCA or to Foote Minerals and to Union Carbide. This is their only market is to sell black cake. They don't have any pharo to sell nor do they
have any caravan or any other finished product of vanadium. They just sell to these companies that I'm saying have got a monopoly on the market. So this is why big oil companies can't come in and bid $10,000,000 cash payment on atomic energy ground is because they have got to advertise a mill that they
don't even know that there's enough, if they're 19

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
taking this 6,000,000 pounds that the Atomic Energy Commission is talking about as being the reserves of this AEC ground. This isn't even enough to advertise a mill, and this is what Union Carbide wants these other companies to think is that there's only the 6,000,000 pounds. Well, they have admitted áto some of us contractors that there are 21,000,000 pounds of-- not what they would call, not what the Atomic Energy Commission calls Positive Reserves, but they're, they're talking about estimated reserves. To go even past that you can figure that there are some reserves other than the estimated reserves. They're going on pretty good information for the estimated reserves, but the indicated reserves would go still a step further to indicate, "Well, now the ground around this had done this, and so even though we don't know hardly anything about the AEC drill holes--" out here in the middle there's a big mine that was an AEC lease at one time and it lapped over all the way
where we give in this particular area say an estimated reserve of so much, it'll double or it will triple or it will ten times that. So I'm saying that there will be at least ten times that. Where they say there's 6,000,000 pounds there's going to be at least 60,000,000 pounds of U-308 that will be mined in
20

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
these areas. But actually nobody's looking at this as 6,000,000 pounds of uranium, at least this isn't what Carbide's looking at because Carbide has filled all their commitments on uranium practically. But they're after a whole bunch of pounds of vanadium to fill their vanadium commitments. If there's 60,000,000 pounds of vanadium in this area there's probably
close to 500,000,000 pounds of vanadium 'cause there' 11 be a ratio of about 7: 1 or something like that. An overall ratio of around 7:1. In some places you'll get 10:1 and in some places you'll maybe get 4:1 or something like that, but the overall average I'd look to see to be at least 7:1.
And that's just an example.
And as if they've got 60,000,000 pounds, seven times that and this would be pretty close to the figure you'll come up with in millions of pounds of V-205.
CE: DS:
CE: And that, when you're talking about the Uravan Mineral Belt do you then include the area in Utah where you grew up, the San Juan County area?
DS: Yes. It's almost an established fact that the Cottonwood area is included in the Uravan Mineral Belt. This belt we've mined, or they know enough of it from down there back nearly to Blanding and they
know enough of it from over here in Slick Rock 21

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
country there around the Daravel and Snider shafts, and in there it's to some extent unexplored but it's considered now in the Uravan Mineral Belt. Yes.
CE: Going back to the late forties: what did you do after you got back from the service?
DS: Well, I went right back to work in Cottonwood.
CE: With your dad and your uncles?
DS: I think I did work two or three weeks, something like
that for Dad and for one of my cousins, Gilbert Shumway, for A. Shumway and Gilbert Shumway. Then Dad--I don't remember whether he just went prospecting or I think Gilbert went somewhere else and they sold me their equipment and--I think maybe sold it to Merlin and Burdette and I. Merlin Shumway, Burdette Shumway and I. We brought the compressor and the jackhammers, whatever equipment they had. I think it probably amounted to a total sum of $750 to $1,OOO or something 1ike that. It was one of these compressors that was a small compressor of some kind run with a Ford V-8 engine. One of these set up on belts and so forth. It turned out to be a good compressor, it ran for a long, long time and we mined
lots of ore with it. But it was secondhand equipment, and in those days you could buy a set of mining equipment for anywhere around from $10,000 down or--
22

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
now a good set of mining equipment to operate the type of mines that you have to run now would cost you around $100,000 probably to buy the up-to-date equipment. Loading equipment, ventilation equipment, compressors and other things that are necessary to
run a trackless mine.
CE: Were you then contractors?
DS: We were leasing from VCA. It was on ground that they
controlled. They'd bought out Blanding Mines and it wa in the Big Hole area, in the same area that I worked for Frank Garbid, Howard Kimberly and them. But at that time it had been acquired by Vanadium Corporation of America and we were working leases under Denny Viles. He'd usually see to it that you could make a living, but he usually saw to it that you couldn't make a very good living. Never on a written contract or lease, he was always on a verbal agreement of some kind, and usually each time he'd come around about once a month, if you had lots of ore he'd cut you back a little and if you had very little ore he'd raise the price a little, and if you had very little ore he'd raise the price a little bit and so forth to where your prices changed from month to month, but there were some areas that he didn't fully understand. When we figured you were living off
23

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
of $300 a month, you could probably be making five hundred to clear or something this way. So usually when he'd look at it and figure you were making maybe only $200 a month he'd think that wasn't quite enough to live on so he'd raise it to where you were making three hundred. Actually you'd have been making maybe three hundred and fifty, which in those days was real good wages anyway. So actually it was quite a lot better than working for wages. He'd usually--as much as we cussed Denny Viles and so forth, usually things were a little better than we ever dared admit.
CE: How many hours did you work each day?
DS: Well, this was something else too, as far as maybe
our mothers or our wives or somebody like that knew we'd be working maybe sixteen or eighteen hours a day, but actually we probably had other things like we'd stop and build and dig monkeys for a while or we'd go shoot a buckskin that morning; get up early to go to work because we knew of a place along the line where there was still one buck left or something. In fact back in those days it was right after the war and there were lots of big bucks around, but we'd go early usually too--when we got out of bed at five o'clock in the morning it was to get up and go shoot a buckskin rather than to get up
24

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
because we had such a burning desire to get back to the mines., We did work I'd say on the average a
little more than eight hours a day in working for ourselves, but quite a lot of the time that we were away from home would be spent just eating a little more lunch than most people used to eat and things like this. We'd spend two or three hours a day maybe just talking over some of the things that we were doing rather than actually working that amount of time. Most people that knew anything about us at that time would probably tell you that we were working maybe twelve hours a day, but it was--we'd be gone sixteen hours and maybe actually work ten hours or something this way.
CE: This takes you up, and you did this up till about '51, and then you became a contractor for Union
Carbide?
DS: Well, this varied from time to time. I worked in many
places during this time from '45 until '51. Actually I worked with Burdette and Merlin Shumway for probably two years or something like that. Then Mark Washburn and I went in together and we worked several different areas, most of the time around Cottonwood, but we did manage to find a little ore and mine for a while at a profit down in Montezuma on the Rock claim
25

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
and the Cottonwood claims. We mined a few other areas that produced some profit. Just prior to coming over here I think would have been--I know Sally was born at the time that we were working down on the reservation. It was a school section on the reservation down at the Whirlwind. Up from Piute Farms along the San Juan River, south of the San Juan River down close to I don't know---?--- Mesa and No Man's Mesa down from Mojao country that we were running the Whirlwind mine for quite a little while. Mined ore that we shipped clear to Durango, for down there then quite a little of this time was spent prospecting. I mean we weren't mining all of the time. There were months there that we'd make maybe two or three thousand dollars in a month and we could afford to go prospecting for maybe a few weeks or something like this way, so by that time it had
devolved to a point in about '46 that I first went into the North Fork of Red Canyon, and as far as I know or as anybody has ever told me I was the first prospector into the North Fork of Red Canyon. And I found every shimrock that was ever worked down there. The channel that the Maybe Mine was worked from; the channel that the Radium King [was on]; the channel that the Spook and the D was on and the one
26

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
that--well, I guess it was the same channel that the Copper claim was on is the one that the Radium King was on. But I went in there first alone and then tried to take Dan Haze in there and he couldn't make
it; it was too far to walk and he thought of going and getting some horses and trying it again, but this never happened. Anyway, I staked claims in there first for Dan Haze and then after a year or so the assessment work came due on it and none had been done so I walked in there with Uncle Pete, with Pete Shumway, and that would have been probably in about
'48 or somewhere along there.
CE: Why did you go to begin with? What prompted you to go
to that area?
DS: I knew the Shinarump was in there and I knew that
nobody else had got into that. The only ones that had gone into these far out places were Dad and his brothers and one old guide by the name of Stevens. I don't remember his first name--Walter Stevens had led burros and had gone into some of these out of the way places, but in talking to Dad I knew that [neither) he nor none of his brothers nor Walter Stevens had been back into this big area of the North Fork of Red Canyon. So I walked in there from Red House over in Red Canyon and walked the first time up over through
27

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
the moss backs and down into Fry Canyon over on White Canyon side. This touched a very small part of it, only the far east part of the North Fork of Red Canyon. So the next time--I'd found a little shorter route in there--the next time I walked in with Uncle Pete and we went from Fry Canyon up though the moss backs and down, which you could walk in maybe seven hours or something like that. It was about a fourteen mile hike or something this way, and you could get down there. We went down sometime in April I think it was, and laid out--didn't have any blankets or anything with us, just carried in a few cans of beans and so forth, and we went in a little further than I went before and staked a number of claims. So I knew a little more about it that time and then--
CE: Could you see the ore? Or did you have a geiger counter?
DS: The first two times I went in we went only on sight. We could see big--Uncle Pete estimated in one small area down there that there was at least 12,000 tons of copper ore showing there in that one area. So, yes, we could see the ore, the copper, and
you could tell--by that time we had looked over enough of the copper and you could tell by that time we had looked over enough of the Shinarump areas to
28

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
know pretty well, you could see some uranium in it too. He was quite enthused about it at that time, but he went down and tried to get in form another route and couldn't make it; the cliffs were such that he
just didn't happen to find the passes and so forth and couldn't get in from the route that he'd tried to before, so this went on for another couple of years. I think it was in about 1950 that Mark Washburn and I walked in the same route, but this time mine and Uncle Pete's assessment work was due and hadn't been done, so Mark and I went in and restaked this country. In fact, we staked a few more claims than had been staked before, not that I found any--I never
found any new channels that I hadn't found; Uncle Pete and I had pretty well gone over it all. I think that Mark and I did find these big, thick sands up there where the Radium King mine went in; that and the Copper claim. We got just a little bit further; well, in fact it was to the extreme west end of the North Fork of Red Canyon that we found this area that Uncle Pete and I had got within two miles of it or something this way. But we found several new places that I hadn't noticed before. That time I got a
little more experience and knew the country a little better and could see the channels a little further
29

 A .
D e V A R SHUMW A Y # 1
away. We had a geiger counter too this time, and as far as we could reach down from the top of the Shinarump down in this one big channel in there that thing would just go plumb wild, and as far as we could reach up from the bottom then it left probably fifteen feet in between that was unknown as to how good it was because we had no ladders and we had no way of reaching down any further than just what the short cord on this geiger counter would reach down. But we were well enough impressed with it that we were real proud of it and we tried to sell it to Anaconda. In fact, Anaconda sent a couple of men down to look at it, but about that time they got interested in the Grants, New Mexico area, and they went on down there. But they did recommend--one of them told me later that he did recommend this to the company, but we were asking $60,000 for it and there
was nearly $60,000,000 mined out of the area in the time that this went on, the mining was done down there. I'm sure that the reserves that are left in that country--I'll say $60,000,000 having been mined down there8
CE: You were miners and prospectors; you were not contractors, and that's why. People have asked me, "Well, why did the Shumways sell these claims?" And
30

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
the explanation I got from Doc. Shumway was that your father, especially, and his three brothers with whom he worked most of the time were miners and prospectors, they weren't contractors and--they
really primarily did just the staking, the finding and then sold these properties. Is that the explanation you had?
DS: Well, they were I'd say more prospectors than anything else. They as far as today's standards go knew very little about mining. They had done quite a little just high-grading and mining on a very limited scale, but I knew a little bit more probably by that time about mining, or at least I know probably more about mining now than the bunch of them put together because of my experience in having produced lots of ore from that time until this, but no, as far as that goes way back then, I would have been in my opinion or terminology of what a miner is today, I was a prospector only. Probably to some extent not a very-- well, I knew very little about geology with the exception of knowing that uranium occurred in the Shinarump and the Morrison [formationsJ and I did
know how to follow the Shinarump formation, but we always operated under the theory that anytime that we can sell what we've found we know where there's a
31

 A .
De VAR SHUMWAY # 1
whole bunch more of it. At that time it was a great large, open country down there that very claims that mostly the Shumways, to some extent a few, maybe
fifty claims had been staked in that area other than what the Shumways held at that time and they would have just covered the first three hundred, six hundred feet back or maybe fifteen hundred feet back from the rim. So we figured that there was a never- ending supply of country that we would go into. Like Red Canyon was; the North Fork of Red Canyon after we found what we did, then Jim Riggs and one of the other--Bob, Robert Riggs I guess it was from here who's father was a eye, ear and nose specialist but they were pilots and river rats and a few things as a hobby, they came down into that country and got Dad to--and they'd set these piper-cubs down on a little grassy knoll or most anything else. After I'd been back into Red Canyon for about the third time Dad and Riggs and them flew in with planes and prospected it still further.
Since it was yours now.
It was probably the Riggs that got the AEC interested in going down and building, because after we had come over to Colorado, after Washburn and I had come over
and were contract mining for Union Carbide, we heard 32
CE: DS:

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
that somebody had gone down there and was drilling or mining some of our property and so forth, so we went down there and found this road going up the hill where we walked up at, at Fry Canyon. I may have
called that Hite sometime during this discussion, but it was at Fry Canyon that this road went up out of there. We drove up and went right down on the Shinarump rims right down to where our camp was. During the time that we were prospecting this when we walked in we had Don Smith fly over with a small plane and drop out bedrolls that we'd put groceries in and a few things. He rolled them out; we built a fire so he could see the smoke and he flew in there and dropped these bedrolls out. Then we had something to--because it was in February and it was real cold. We'd just gone back into this cave and there was a crack in the middle of it and we could drag trees and wood and so forth in there and then feed the fire all night, him sleeping on one side and me on the other and taking turns putting wood on the fire we could make it real good with some small bedrolls. They weren't sleeping bags, just quilts and blankets, but we'd left them hanging there in that cave. When we went back that way the AEC had built a road up there and was drilling these properties. There were our
33

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
bedrolls hanging to where we could drive right up to them! But we had been working over here in Colorado at that time, and this was probably about '53 or '54 or somewhere along in there or maybe as late as '55 that they built roads up there. So actually we had very little claim on any of the ground even though we'd--I'd been in there too soon and with too much
so many times before. They'd all gone delinquent by this time and I would have been better off actually to have never gone in there the first time until about 1952 or somewhere along then. Then I would have made this discovery while I could still hold the claims. But the AEC had come in when our claims had gone delinquent and most other people's had, and other people just went in there behind the AEC drill rigs and claimed whatever they found. I did get some royalty out of some of this property, but most of it had gone delinquent so that all that was nothing but just some good exercise.
CE: By this time, by the time '55 you were already working for Union Carbide.
DS: Yeah. We were contracting. In fact, I think that this was after we had moved to Grand Junction; after Mark and I had moved from Blanding over here to Grand Junction. We would've known of this if we had still
34

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
been living down there, but it was several years after we'd gone to work for Union Carbide that the AEC went in there and built roads to the country where if we had been keeping a little bit better
track of it we would have been a lot better off. Actually, we, we offered to give these claims one time to Jim Borden. No, I guess it was Ev Paris that we went and offered to give them these claims if they'd go in and build a road and contract them back to us. Told him--
CE: This is Union Carbide now. Borden was with Union Carbide.
DS: Yes. Yes. Well, it was when Ev Paris was my superintendent for Union Carbide. We, we went down there and told them that we were proud of the contracts that we had with them, that we were making more money than we'd ever made working for Denny
Viles or anybody else and were doing real well as contractors. We were making good enough that we figured that it was better to have them own the claims, to find the ore with drill holes, to plot the mining for us, and to pay us for doing it and then pay us for the ore that we mined and so forth, that
we would give them the claims. But Paris said
that they didn't have any policies of that kind and
35
no,

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
they didn't especially want some claims off down there and so forth. Well, Carbide shunned that country for years. They never did get into it; never did get a foothold of any kind in that Shinarump country down there. Jim Borden told me later, he said that he sure did wish that it had been a time when the policies had changed a little bit and that we'd have come and made that offer because he knew the offer had been made and knew of the discoveries that the AEC had made in drilling in behind that country and what got mined at that time that some of these other companies went in there and mined this ground and so forth. Why of course that's hindsight, or again this hindsight is real valuable but it's no good to anybody. I would like to have seen it go that route and would like to have contracted this all back from Union Carbide, but it never went this route anyway. At this time we were over here; by that time I don't know whether I was off of Calamity yet or
not. That's where I first went to work for Union Carbide was up on Calamity Mesa on Sunflower mine. Then after the Sunflower was cleaned up they gave me Calamity I7 and I3 and 7 and oh, the number 6 and the Dixie, and I think that there were probably about 25 or 27 mines that I worked out of Blanding for
36

 A . DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
them.
CE: What would be your arrangement as you were working for Union Carbide? Do you have a--do they supply the equipment or do you supply your own, and what would be the percentages?
DS: I think that's entirely up there. We supplied our own equipment. There have been all kinds of different arrangements made, but I think that entirely on Calamity I furnished my own equipment. But there have been times since then that they've furnished most of the equipment. But there have been times since then that they've furnished most of the equipment. Like when we went to Temple Mountain they had $300,000 worth of equipment that was there and nobody using it, and they wanted somebody on Temple Mountain so they just told us to go over there and use whatever we wanted of that equipment and mine whatever ore we could. This is another story, of course. Temple Mountain is--but as far as Calamity is concerned I furnished all of the equipment and I think it probably would have been something like a split check. I don't remember for sure these contracts. There have been all kinds of different
ones with all kinds of different mine superintendents or--well, let's see; Johnny Hill was superintendent
37

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
of mines for Carbide when I went on for Calamity. But before I left Ev Paris had been made my superintendent and died. Bill Blanny had followed him and he died and then Jim Borden was my superintendent at the time that I got off of Calamity. By the time I'd cleaned up the last one that they--hey well, it
just seemed that they weren't going to let me off Calamity until I'd finished cleaning up all the mines that they wanted cleaned up there.
CE: Locate these for me. Temple Mountain and Calamity. I've heard you mention these before and--
DS: Well, Temple Mountain was quite a while later, but Calamity was the mine that I worked from about '51 until around '56 or--'56 I think it was when I finally got off of Calamity. Calamity is--there are three routes to get into it. You could go up the hill from Gateway up what they call the Big Hill which was
áat the time that I first went down there the only route that I knew into there. It was about that time that they built the road from Taylor's Ranch up over the Uncompahgre. It would drop back down on Calamity.
The other route that you could get in would be to go up Mesa Creek, turn up Mesa Creek over there this side of or north of Uravan and go up Mesa Creek and back over down into Blue Creek and up over Outlaw
38

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
Mesa and down through and back into Calamity, that
route. There was those three ways into there. As far as I know they're still the only three ways unless you can fly in or ride a horse in or walk in or something this way. But they--you want me to locate you mean--?
I just wanted--
Calamity Mesa or--?
Just the general area, so that if I looked at a map I'd know where the Calamity mines were located. What you have done is essentially that.
Actually they would be from Gateway--air miles wouldn't be but a few miles up over from Gateway setting back up on. Of course Gateway's way off down in the canyon down along the river and this is a lot higher that is set back up. (It would] probably be only about five or six air miles from Gateway back
more or less southeast, more east probably than-- well, about southeast of Gateway.
During this period of time I read in the Daily Sentinel there were problems regarding assays. Some of the independent miners accused Union Carbide, for instance, of not giving accurate assays.
Well, this has been history of all miners. They always claim that the mill cheats them, and to some
CE: DS: CE:

extent I'm sure that this has gone on, but I always figured that this was their business and there was nothing I could do about it. I've never--maybe with the exception of about twice ever run an ---?--- sample.
[END OF P ART ONE OF INTER VIEW]

 [ T H I S I S THE CONTINUA TION OF AN INTER VIEW WITH A . DEV AR SHUMWAY, CONDUCTED BY CLARE ENGLE ON JUL Y 2 2 , 1 9 7 0 AT ORCHARD MESA, COLORADO FOR THE UTAH URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT. TAPE #1.]
DS: In some cases they cheated us and we knew it and then even gave reasons for it. Over at Temple Mountain this was a very complex ore for their mill and it was a lot better ore than about any that we'd mined before and bigger ore to what we'd been used to mining. We knew that the ore over there would run say sixty-hundreths, but we got thirty-hundreths out of
it. But we were still making a good profit and we didn't want to upset the apple cart and we went along with this in its entirety. Jim Borden admitted that this pile of ore would run eighty-seven hundredths, and yet when we got out assays back it was only thirty-five hundredths or something like that. But to this extent where we knew it was living under this agreement more or less getting paid for what they were recovering. Their recovery was real poor on that and they couldn't have paid us what it was actually worth and stayed in production there and stayed there and let us go ahead and mine. When we were making say $10,000 in a month there, rather than say, "Well, because you people are cheating us we're going to quit." Well, this isn't a very good idea, so we just
went right ahead and agreed that we would accept this 41

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
kind of pay, and if we could get half of what the ore ran and mine it in Temple Mountain I'd go back there today and mine some more there. I'd rather mine some places for--and get half of what the ore's worth than to mine other places and get 200% of what it's worth. Because you might have a whole bunch of ore here and you might have nothing over there, or in other words 50% of the whole bunch is quite a lot in some places, but 100% of nothing is still nothing. So I'd rather mine Temple Mountain and get 50% of the values paid
for than I would to mine someplace else and get 200% when you can't even make a living on 200%.
CE: You're implying then that Union Carbide was equitable.
DS: Yes. In fact, even today I think that it's real difficult to get 2% uranium assay, and yet some places why you'11 find 2% ore but they've got a problem. This mill in Uravan for instance probably gets about 50% of the values in vanadium, so it'd be pretty difficult for those people to give you 4% assay and pay you 40¢ for the pound that they're
going to recover, but they'll maybe split the difference with you or something like that. In this meeting the other day over in Moab, a meeting of the
42

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
independent producers, two or three of them stood up and took to complaining about the assays that they were getting back of the kind of ore that they were shipping, that they knew that they were shipping better ore than that. I told them this is a problem that had gone on with the history of the mining business regardless of whether you ship hardrock to a smelter or you ship to someplace like Union Carbide that pays the freight and you're shipping ore to them, this is still the problem. I said the only-- you've got a little dial inside your probe, your geiger counter that all you've got to do is take the top off and take a screwdriver and set it back a little ways. If you set that thing back far enough you' 11 get such good assays that you' 11 think that you're cheating the company. They knew what I meant, and our probes, most of them [are] set--like if we're setting a probe for, on twenty-eight hundredths scale down there you put them inside one of these pots or something like that and you set it and we know that runs twenty-eight hundredths but will cut it back to
where our probe says twenty hundredths, and then when we probe load or when we are probing loads or ore that's going in this pile it'll probably be seven or eleven or something like that and stop at probably
43

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
about eleven. It will come back fifteen hundredths, stuff that we probe eighteen hundredths, it'll come back about twenty-five hundredths. Well, whenever we put a pile out there and I probed it and it runs twelve-hundredths it isn't really surprising to me that it runs twenty hundredths, but it usually does. So if you work under these assumptions and so forth
I've got no qualms with Union Carbide. Over the years I feel absolutely appreciative of the assays that I've received and the amount of money that I've been paid and the deals that I've had and so forth with Union Carbide or VCA, either one.
CE: And a company had to come in, didn't it? These miners and prospectors have to have a company which they can work [with,] and it might as well be Union Carbide.
DS: Yes. I, I don't think that the miners always got any real complaints coming as to the shake that they've got out of these companies. I can see that they've got problems; in fact they've had some problems that they haven't even known about. There's been salting of samples, there have been other things that have
gone on that--that is another story that they would have thought they had 28,000 pounds of U-308 in a pile, and when it runs through their mill they probably come up with less than half that and they
44

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
probably blame mill tailings or something like that for it. But something had to account for it, for there had to be an accounting somewhere along the
line for the pounds that they lost it that route. There have been things like crooked chemists within their own organizations, there have been things like when they were hand sampling, that hand samplers would for enough to buy a case of beer or something like that would make $500 difference in your load of ore.
CE: What do you mean by hand sampler?
DS: Back in the days when--before they put in these
sampling plants the truck would dump a load of ore, it'd just be a pile, and then they'd dig through this pile. They'd throw maybe five shovels away and then put one in a wheelbarrow and this would be cut down and this is what they'd sample. You could do such things as you know what ore is going to come up in that little V there. You could put anything you wanted right in the tailgate of this thing, big rocks or--no sampler is going to knock anything off of one of those big rocks that's right square on the bottom in the tail gate of this truck. Say this is your load
of ore right here and all of the back end where it's going to dump out first you could put whatever you
45

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
wanted to. Well, this little V right in here is the only place that you needed to worry about getting your high grade, and then that was dumped--there would be that high grade right there for the sampler to dig through. Wel1, of course, it wasn't always quite that accurate, but you'd have troubles maybe with your truck driver dumping it just like you wanted it or sometimes they'd come out and see that's where the best ore was and so you had to have some mixture some of this other stuff. But you could be there when they were sampling this and if you knew the sampler pretty well for a $20 bill he'd throw in the best piece of ore that you had there. These companies have had this to put up with to some extent besides crooked chemists, and even the people that were on the sampler when it was an automatic sampler, they had access in some cases to a spoonfull of real pretty colored---?--- ore that they could get mixed up with your ore. Some people were even as much as in
partners with the sampler and payed the sampler as much as--I remember one time--this here I wouldn't want you to ever use in your history, but I paid a sampler one time eighteen $100 dollar bills for his
month's work in rounding up ore that-- CE: Eighteen $100 bills?
46

 A . DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
OS: Yes. $1,800 that he made for the amount that we knew
that he'd run up our ore. So anything--maybe because I've experienced this kind I'm a little more than some people would be on the side of the mill because there have been times when I'm sure that they've made quite a little of that back, but there was a time when I figured that I was absolutely even with them; that they hadn't made a dime off me. Denny Viles used to say that the VCA had made millions of dollars off of people that were trying to beat them. Of course all miners are trying to beat them if they can, but there have been probably very few of us that ever to any great extent got even with them. I imagine most miners could tell you of some experience if they've been in as long as I have; they could tell you of the experience when they bought off the sampler or they bought off the chemist or they salted a sample or they figured some other way to beat the company. So for these reasons and others that I could mention, I think that Union Carbide and VCA is given a pretty fair shake all the way through.
CE: What do you remember about the boom years? Not if--if it relates to Union Carbide fine, but just in general, I'm very interested in that period of time.
You lived here then.
47

 A . DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
DS: A good share of that time I spent contract mining.
There was, we were still in boom years even during the Eisenhower administration. A lot of that time I was working private leases. In fact, at times I was working Union Carbide contracts, VCA contracts, Carbacks contracts, private leases, and then some of our own personal property, but the boom years I'm sure mean different people. I've got a little sign down there on the desk that says, "Recessions don't bother me, I was a failure during the boom." But--
CE: Is that true? It couldn't be true.
DS: No, it isn't entirely true because I not only made
money off of Union Carbide contracts and these other contracts but I also made money on leases and on some private ground. But the big money, the money that you ' re talking about when you' re talking about the big good mines, these were mostly privately-owned mines that did make lots of money like Charlie Steen's mine of Mi Vida or like the Happy Jack for Bronsons and like a number of others that--maybe you're talking about the boom years, but the boom years to me--Union Carbide was lenient in the amount of money that they'd let us make. You don't make that kind of money anymore on their contracts because they've got these IBM machines that just about show
48

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
them how much a miner can make. They allow you to make maybe a real good salary plus a little bit of something for the use of your equipment. But back in those days you were apt to hit anybody that you could make $10,000 a month or something like this even on a contract, and a number of contractors probably made more than that. I'm sure there were some of the months that I made quite a lot more than any
$10,000 a month just on a Union Carbide contract, but these were the boom years when it was more or less unknown. Now that you're working more or less known ore reserves it's figured just what the economics will be on it and most of them are whacked back to where maybe an operation like the one that I'm running now, it may do--oh, about $50,000 last year over and above all the expenses. .They take out such things as depreciation on the equipment and things this way. So it's pretty well fixed anymore as to what you're going to make. But back there during the boom years you might hit a lucky streak and make $250,000 or a quarter of a million in one year and it might be that you'll just barely break even or something this way. Well, boom years to me means these things where now either through our experiences or through more knowledge of the industry or
49

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
something else the boom is eliminated and you're working on fixed reserves to where you just about know how much you're going to make in the next year on a particular operation. Of course there is still this much to it; there are some places [where] you're going to find that it isn't quite as good as you expected. But it's going to more or less average out. I can remember back when I first started this that I figured one real big good ore body was going to make me rich and that I wouldn't have any worries from then on. Yet I've gone through twenty of them the size that I was dreaming of back at that time and still haven't found one that quite gets it done yet. I'm still in there trying.
CE: Well, you wouldn't want to quit now, you're too young to quit now. You--
DS: Thank you.
CE: You couldn't have spent all your time monkey digging. DS: But this is what the boom years mean to me more or
less; just a time when the factor of surprise was still in it. Anymore it's the old drudgery of going out and taking a drill rig and finding some deep ore and figuring the economics as to whether it's profitable to go back and mine it or not. Well, in those days you were following these channels along
50

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
and you didn't know what was ahead of you; the drill rigs hadn't been there yet and you didn't know even from one canyon to the next what might be in there. The boom, of course, had a lot of AEC money in it that was enticement to come in and pick it up, which made it a lot easier. The AEC or government funds, which I'm sure is true in almost any industry, if you've got enough government funds feeding it, it will really be thriving. They made the price of
uranium that if we could get that price even as badly mined out as the country is today and we're still mining in the original uranium of this nation, but a lot of it has been mined out since the time that they came up with $7 a pound or something like that for the first 30,000 or 10,000 pounds to the miner. We don't have the same prices to go on anymore and we've got triple the price of explosives and fuse and your fuels have gone up some; the price of equipment is lots higher and the price of hired help is far greater than it was at the time that there was $7 a pound on U-308. So actually that made a lot of boom to where a good share of the economy or the economics of it, the money of has been taken away and a lot of other things have been added in to where actually there's only one area that we've got as good
51

 A .
D e V A R SHUMW A Y # 1
a go was we had then, and that's in the field of explosives because we've learned to shoot this prill we call it. It's actually the nitrogen fertilizer that we've learned to explode with one stick of dynamite. You can shoot around actually as cheap today as you could twenty years ago. But outside of that it's the only one that I know of, with the exception of the price of buckskin that you can still get just as cheap as you could then.
CE: I think it's time now for you to tell me about the Black Box incident.
DS: Well, I suppose that this is that thing that Dal Peterson and somebody else, I forget this other guy's name, but anyway, they bought this thing down--the first place I'd ever seen it tried. They had told Mark Washburn and Doug Cleghorn and I about it, and their story sounded so convincing that we asked several questions and we got--as the way I'd term it now probably nothing but lies, but I'm still not fully convinced that there wasn't something that they
had in this thing because we tried to fool them several times and were never successful at all in fooling them. For instance, the first time that I tried this I brought them down to an unknown area
that nobody had seen the map except VCA and myself. 52

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
I'd gone and got a new map of some new drilling and I went down here to Slick Rock there at the Old Delany property and I gave them four problems and they came up so close to the right answer that I figured that they surely must have something. For instance, I asked them what these four holes had in them and two of them I knew had nothing. Well, this is what they came up with.
CE: Well, tell me about the box. What did they use it for?
DS: I don't know, but it looked something like that Samsonite briefcase right there and I didn't ever see what was inside of it. They couldn't--when we were flying or when we were someplace else I'd have to leave the area and they'd go behind their car or something and use this thing. They were talking about components that was in it that were real expensive. One of the first troubles that they had was they had to get a lead shield for one of the components
because the ore that they'd [been] hauling around had contaminated it. I never did find out what was in it or whether it was just absolutely empty.
CE: Where did they come from? Where did these men come from?
DS: One of them was out of Idaho and the other was out of 53

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
Utah and two or three of them that--the guy that was supposed to have been the inventor of this thing was the fellow from Idaho. This Dal Peterson. Whether he had completely hoodwinked these other people into believing what he had or not I don't know because
these other two men that were in on it that knew nothing of what was in the black box, at least one of them didn't--were men of high standing. One of them is operating today as something out of BYU. He's a geologist and is a good geologist, and yet to some extent he seemed to fall for this thing, but he wasn't in on these first problems that I give them. But anyway, whenever we would take them to a drill hole they could more or less tell us what was down in that drill hole and I never saw them fail. They did it in several different areas. Whether it was something that he had that would actually tell when he--he finally told me, he said, "Well, let's get off of this taking me to known areas, to areas where the drill hole is," because he says that I get a shine out of that--his terminology wasn't anything like the miners and so forth, but he'd tell me just about the elevation that the ore was on and would tell me how good it was, in both vanadium and uranium and would tell me pretty close to how thick it was and could do
54

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
it in most any area. But the thing that they were going to do was take us to a place and drill a hole and have the ore be what they said was down there. I took them to area that I knew there was ore in the vicinity but they'd, go there in unknown ground and define the channel in there and tell me how good the ore was. Well, up here at La Sal Creek for instance we--they were three hundred feet too far south. I
forget how they told this or made excuses for having missed it this far and so forth but they told me about this channel that went back through here that-- how light it was and how good it was and so forth. We drilled off here three hundred feet. Well, later on I found this channel just almost like they said it was, too about two or three hundred feet to the north of there. But it ran the same direction, was about the same kind or ore and everything else as what they said was off down there. They called it a deflection. [They] said that it was a deflection of some kind with their equipment, but he never was successful in getting this to punch a hole here and come up with the amount of ore that he said was there. Now one that I was talking about what we--Homestead Minerals owns the property today down in Mineral Canyon. We
went down there and drilled seven holes that cost 55

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
something like $5,000, and Doug Cleghorn and Mark Washburn and I were in on this thing. We went down there and drilled these seven holes and they were probed by VCA and Foote Minerals' probe truck and they were all seven of them very favorable holes. They'd put us down in the channel there, but hadn't come up with anywhere near the type of ore that they were supposed to have had. Instead of having twenty feet of fifty hundredths ore we came up with maybe fifteen feet of seven hundredths ore or something like that which was the best hole there, and yet this thing that we could take--fly them over country that any one of us knew, and when they'd get over this flying they would pick it up. We couldn't take, we couldn't ever make them miss whenever they'd get over ore bodies that we knew of regardless of where it was and even out in country that nobody else should have
known anything at all about it and they'd pick it up. Yet they couldn't ever put the drill holes in it or they--a lot of it we never did even check out; they'd five channels; that would have meant into the
billions of dollars in the uranium industry if they'd ever materialized, if they could have actually produced with this thing. But yet I could never bring myself to think that there maybe wasn't a little bit
56

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
of something to it because it'd given it so many problems that nobody knew anything about but me, and
if I'd given these same problems to Mark Washburn or Doug Cleghorn that even with their knowledge of the geology and so forth they couldn't have come up with any better with elevations nor told me any more even knowing the country as to what it would run in vanadium and what it would run in uranium or how good an ore body you could expect and things 1ike this. How? I don't know, I don't trust the man that did it,
I don't like his way of operating, and yet to some extent why I still believe that if he would have worked with us and confided with us and tried to work out his principle on this thing either we would have saved out money and not gone any further or we would have helped him out and perfected this thing or made a success of it. One or the other would have happened, and yet he wasn't honorable enough to allow us to do this, so I don't know. This is the more or less in a nutshell the story of the black box that you're talking about.
CE: Well, how did you discover that he was wrong? You went right out and checked it?
DS: We drilled in about ten places or something like that. We were--in partners we had to have a contract
57

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
or some kind of an agreement, a partnership agreement of some kind drawn up with these people and--
CE: Spent lots of money?
DS: No, not a lot of money. Not actually.
CE: Did you pay them ahead of time?
DS: No. We didn't pay them anything. They never made
anything out of it; they couldn't make anything unless it was successful. This is something else that absolutely made you think that they must have something, because they spent a lot of money trying to prove that this thing was successful. They could pick up these and it wasn't scintillator equipment I don't think that would pick up the--you know these airborne scintillators, you can pick up anomalies from the air. Yet this isn't the principle that this thing was working on. He could even--we could be off out in the desert where there wasn't any Shinarump below us or anything and we could ask him which direction it is to the ore from here or something like that. Way off down this Monument 2, and I'm sure that he didn't know where that thing was--it looks like a gravel pit or something like that, and he was behind a curtain in this airplane and we flew him over that thing and before he got there he told us that it was coming up and then he knew when we were
58

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
over it and knew when we had passed. All of these things, and not only that, but on that same trip we went on back--! could see some Shinarump way off over there and I told Doug Cleghorn to head that direction and he went over there and they picked that thing up.
In talking to Bob Anderson about it, this unknown channel that VCA has explored to some extent was down there and I didn't know where this was and Doug didn't know where it was, and yet we headed over there and he picked the damn thing up. Things like this that, that just would plumb revive your faith in this instrument again, and yet you had the experience of trying to drill into some of these things. Now whether this deflection had anything to do with it or not and that he did actually miss that ore body, if he can cut me even in the ballpark; if he could hit within 300' I can go ahead and find the thing from there on. But this was in property that we already owned and I knew that there might be another one too. In fact, he might have been 75' away from it if we ever drilled it out and find the thing, but this black box was something that either had to be a multibillion dollar thing or else nothing. Of course it turned out to be nothing, but I don't know what principle it might have been working on. I don't know
59

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
that there's anything other than luck in the number of times that he was right. I still can't bring myself to believe that there's nothing at all to it because the number of times that he went back to the same spot from different directions and would pick this thing up again. And from the air, why Mark and Doug and I can't even keep our bearings good enough to know this, and they would try anything to mix him up and confuse him, but you couldn't fool that thing, you couldn't fool them, or what it was I still don't know, but it was unsuccessful to the extent that we couldn't drill into it at least.
CE: Frustrating.
DS: Yeah.
CE: Is there anything else you want to tell me about your
years with Union Carbide? Anything that you think is significant that would contribute to the knowledge of the company and how it works and how it has treated its people?
DS: Well, still today if I wasn't working for this outfit what I'd do probably is go right back and see Wally Bick and get a Union Carbide contract or would go to Bob Anderson if VCA started up again and go back into contract mining.
CE: What are you doing now? You said you left-- 60

 A . DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
OS: Well, I'm running the Shumway Division or what was
the Shumway Division; it's now the Grand Junction Division of Homestead Minerals. [I'm] running this for a salary for Homestead Minerals; I sold out to them about two years ago.
CE: Why?
OS: It'11 be two years ago the first of next month.
Actually the prices and everything, in my opinion, deteriorated to where with Social Security like it was and having to pay so much more state tax and so much more state compensation and a number of other things that the economics just didn't look good. At that time I had a good offer from them for what looked like a stock company that was realing going-- I sold to them aánd sold actually nothing that I couldn't pick up again. Leases and equipment and so forth. I can always go and get another set equipment and I can always go and get another contract and start right back in again. I figured that at time I looked to see there would be about a three year period of more or less changing dollars or something this way. I wasn't having very much
success, and even though the company made--with this same operation the same kind I was running and the same equipment and everything, they've made
61
of

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
$50,000 a year for the last two years. I had no sure cinch that it was going to make that much. In fact, it didn't look to me like at the time that it would make that much, but I at the time figured that it was going to be a laxer period than what it actually has been. The price of uranium couldn't go up until after the AEC had sold all of hers and so much uranium being found that I didn't anticipate the price of
vanadium going up. This has made a little difference in the last few years and is more or less my thinking on the possibilities of going back again, but I maybe would go back and start contract mining for Union Carbide. I always preferred working for VCA especially in past years because VCA doesn't know what they've got; they haven't done near the exploration that Carbide has. There again you go back to the fact that there are some surprises with VCA, but Carbide pretty well when they turn you loose on a contract they know pretty close to how much you're going to be able to mine, how many thousand tons it will be, what the overall assays will be and so forth and how much money can be made on a contract. But with VCA if they've got one good ore hole over here it might be 1,000' from any other ore hole and yet they want you to run down and mine that ore. About
62

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
the last hole that I ran to for VCA I mined around $400,000 worth of ore out of one hole. It was really good ore hole and it was in good country and without drilling any other holes just from this hole that was about three hundred feet, two hundred and ninety feet
I think it was, from any other hole and from the point that we were to start off and run to this thing we weren't hardly ever out of ore from that point where we started over to this ore and mined right close to half a million dollars worth of ore from this one hole. Well now, if this had been Union Carbide they would have had twenty other holes around this and would have pretty well known what the ore reserves were there. But this is one reason why I'd rather VCA would come back in and that Foote Minerals would come back in is because they've probably got as much or more ore than Union Carbide has except they don't know where theirs is. They haven't found it yet. Here again is a good opportunity to make some good money that they don't know is in there. In Carbide you actually don't have some of these advantages like that. It might be better, it's possible that we could've run over to that hole and found that there was only a half a truckload or something like that; they hit a little tiny tree bud
63

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
or something like that in this. But there again it was an area that I trusted further than that, but therefore for these reasons I'd rather that Foote Minerals would come back in and that I could go back to work on some of the same properties that I used to have with Foote Minerals. Because even though it would be probably a little better than the salary that I'm making now to go to work for Union Carbide life wouldn't be quite as easy as it is now. I actually have got a job that makes very few demands on my time. I do only those things, and that's all that's required of me is to do just what I more or less want to do or what I feel like would be of benefit to the company. Of course, it's part my company; I probably own around 5% of it, about 5% of the stock that is out in Homestead Minerals. I own it, and consequently to that extent I'm still working for myself, but there have never been any pressures from anybody for me to quit my monkey digging or
quit my hunting or quit chasing around in a company vehicle using their gas and at their expense on an expense account and so forth. They figured that the things that I do are valuable enough to them that they don't seem to want to turn me loose and they go ahead and put up with any amount of nonsense like of
64

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
course, wherever I go just about I'm looking for a lease or a contract that will do them some good or I'm associating with people that I can lease some of their property to. Anytime that they've got a question of any kind that pertains to the Uravan Mineral Belt they can get an answer out of it in five minutes form me that would take them days of research to go and look up the same area and come up with the
same answer. It's knowledge that I've got. This is available at just any time that is partly what they're paying me for I suppose. If it had been me I'd have fired me a long time ago, but--
CE: What's the future of the independent miner and contractor after the AEC program is phased out at the end of this year?
DS: In the Uravan Mineral Belt I suppose you-- CE: On the Plateau.
DS:
I think that with vanadium being what it is that the- -it's looking up a little bit. I don't look to see them lower the price of a trace. I think that if they lower the price of uranium any they'11 raise the price of vanadium enough to make up for it, or if they cut it in one area they'll raise it in another one. I don't think that we're going to get hurt at all unless these AEC blocks are turned loose. If they
65

 A . D e V A R SHUMW A Y # 1
are the independent miner is a thing of the past for several years.
CE: Are you objecting to that through your association? Or can't you? Objecting to their being turned loose.
DS: Yes. I'm objecting to that being turned loose and in fact in that meeting down there at Moab the other night I went to it especially because I could see the handwriting on the wall. If that gets turned loose this isn't going to do the independent miner a bit of
good; it's only going to harm him. We had or they to some extent fought to get that turned loose not realizing that this would benefit only Union Carbide. I'm in favor of it being turned loose if we have competition from two or more mills, I mean two or more. Union Carbide has got two mills, but it's no competition. If VCA or if Foote Minerals would come
back or if Atlas would put in a vanadium circuit. Possibly this Rio Tinto that's going into Lisbon V alley or down in Big Indian D istrict if they would put in a vanadium circuit; I've heard that they've got quite a little vanadium in that low ore that--I mean this deep ore that they've got running this production shaft and ventilation shaft into there now, but I don't look to see them come in. If they
did their mill and process wouldn't be amenable. I 66

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
mean their mill, the ore from Uravan Mineral Belt wouldn't be amenable to their plant anyway, so I don't look to see that do us any good. But possibly
one of the big oil companies if we could convince them that instead of there being 6,000,000 pounds of U-308 that the AEC is talking about that there would be 60,000,000 and enough to show a profit off after advertising an expensive mill or something this way, possibly one of them would come in. But there isn't really very much incentive for one of them to come into the Uravan Mineral Belt because of the vanadium market being all tied up like it is and there being so much ore, so many millions of pounds of U-308 in Ambrosia Lake or in New Mexico and up in Wyoming and northern Colorado and through the country that can be so economically strip-mined and milled. In the Uravan Mineral Belt the uranium is a by-product of vanadium down here, and without the vanadium the Uravan Mineral Belt would have long since gone under. But
with the uranium being a by-product of vanadium if they can get $6 a pound for it and the price of vanadium being what it is, it's got quite a lot of life left in it. But I don't know. It's a pretty dim picture if they turn loose the AEC reserves and just let Union Carbide gobble it up for the contractors,
67

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
because right now with all of the known ore that they've got in several of those blocks--one of those blocks like the two that I've mentioned, the one on Atchinson Mesa or the one over at Monogram or a combination of those is--in Long Park these three areas can support the--probably both the Uravan plant and with what they would have going with this Rifle production it would support--any one of those three would support those two mills for three years. Even though John Emerson and some of these people would maybe try to point out to the AEC that this would take several years to get into, set up so that it could produce that amount of ore on Atchison Mesa, to go back into the Sandy or to go back into the Wooster and the Golden Cycle along with several of the other smaller mines that are right around the perimeter of this thing why, could produce a thousand tons of ore
a day for the lifetime of that ore body. This along with what they're already getting would run both plants; they will tell you that, would tell the AEC that, that this would take quite a while to get set up like that, but it's already set up like that. Doug Cleghorn could go back to some of those big stokes that are back in there and with a little bit more equipment which wouldn't take--but just coming down
68

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
here and ordering the equipment that would be delivered the next day or something like that. He could get into production there that 'Would produce
500 tons a day for a long, long time, and so there's no other way. But what if they get it? They'11 run it [through] company mines until they get an area pretty well cleaned out and then would turn it over to one of us contract miners to clean up for them. They know that we can operate a lot cheaper than they can, and yet their good big ore bodies, they're running them all today with the company mines. They run them company and then they turn them over for us contractors to go in and clean up and to mine the smaller ore after they've cleaned it out. Then there's one or two of their geologists or mining engineers who would put it--they go there and clean it out and then turn it over to the contract miner to
make all the money. Certainly they make some money, but their costs are quite fantastic in mines that it costs them $20 a ton. If they'd turn it over to me I can produce it at $10 a ton and still make some profit and they could make all the profit that they're making presently, but the type of contract that they'd give me.
CE: Well, why do they do it then? 69

 A . DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
DS: I don't know. It's just that they've got some people
involved in their company that are on the production end of it and they want to keep their jobs, so they go ahead and keep running the company mines. But their superintendents and so forth have known for a long time that they can hire this done cheaper than they can do it themselves, that they can get contract miners to go in. Of course maybe they don't always have the same control over the contract miners that they would have over company men or something this way, and to some extent this might be it. But the overall cost on the mill and the Maybe and the Dermo and the Snyder and several of the other places that they have run company, they could have contracted it and made $5 a ton or more or something like that
[compared to] when they produced it for the company operation. So I can't tell you the answers as to why this still goes on, but I think that it's a big enough outfit that it's something similar to why does Uncle Sam still keep some of the operations going that are obsolete? There are still government--well, within the Atomic Energy Commission there's a lot of deadwood there that might just as well be counted out if Uncle Sam only knew it. They know it within the
Atomic Energy Commission but who is going to say, 70

 A .
DeV AR SHUMWAY # 1
"I'm just dead weight, so I'm going to quit," when he's got a good government job? Who is there within Union Carbide that's going to say, "Let's turn this mine over to Shumway and this one over to Cleghorn and this one over to Blake and this one over to Washburn and this one over to Bunker because they'll make us more money than we can make ourselves," when they are getting a real good salary? Is that anywhere near the question you were talking about?
CE: Yes. Yes. I think that answers it. Is there anything else that you want to contribute before we conclude this?
DS: Well, nothing that I know of unless you've got some questions that you want to ask.
CE: I think we've covered all the questions that I had prepared.
DS: Do you care anything about the magnitude of these operations? How much ore that was ever produced? How many mines that were maybe running for Union Carbide at one time, or do you know enough about the number of mines that I've run or that contractors have run and so forth? This might be something of interest, I don't know. I started out like I said with an ore contract, but probably in the overal1 picture for
Union Carbide I imagine that I mined probably around 71

 A . D e V A R SHUMW A Y # 1
sixty mines for them.
CE: In the twenty year period?
DS: Yeah. And probably mined around the same amount for
VCA I think that--the mines [were] anything that you could call from sinking with an incline or running back from the rim of the drift or a shaft or something else to maybe one drill hole to some of them with a whole bunch. Some of them were real small operations and some of them were some of the largest operations that probably run in the neighborhood from 150 to a 175 mines. In the Colorado Plateau, these are ranged from all the way from down on the reservation down in Shinarump country south of the San Juan River (which isn't in the Uravan Mineral Belt) up to, to Meeker, Colorado in Uranium Park country (that was outside the Uravan Mineral Belt) and some down in Shootaring Canyon and some over in Temple Mountain that was Shinarump country. Some of them in around Green River, and I guess most of the rest of them have been in the Uravan Mineral Belt, but there have been--oh, I've probably run or been instrumental in running either as a partnership or individual operations more mines than any other
individual that I know of unless it would be Mark Washburn. I don't know. I've never asked him how many
72

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
it's been and we've never got around to figuring it up, but I don't know of anybody else that would even come close to having mined this number of mines in this country or in the, on the Colorado Plateau that I've run. It's been at almost every known area where there's been any uranium to be mined that there is in the Colorado Plateau. At one time Shumway and David was producing probably about a third of the ore that was running the mill at Shiprock, New Mexico for VCA, but when VCA had it and when Foote Minerals had it we were probably about a third of the ore that the contract miners were producing plus we were producing quite a little of the custom ore that was going to it and at the same time producing ore for the plant there at Uravan from Union Carbide. I think it had continuously in the last--oh, during my mining period in the neighborhood from about four to twenty-seven mines. I think twenty-seven was the most that I ever ran at one time but--
CE: How many people did you have working for you then?
DS: I think about 140 at peak production was about the most that we ever had working. Most of these were Navajos, and right now is probably about the smallest amount of men that I've worked in the last fifteen years or something this way. But God, I think about
73

 A. DeVAR SHUMWAY #1
14 men or something like that working presently.
CE: How many people, how many contractors would Union Carbide have working for them at a general level?
DS: I think there was a time when they had around fifty or sixty mines going, maybe fifty or sixty contractors. I heard that figure not too long ago where now they're down to about 13 or something like that. At one time probably back in Bill Blaney's and Ev Paris' time and the first part of Jim Borden's time there were probably around fifty or sixty mines and contract miners that were--50 or sixty contract miners that were in operation. Some of them had several difficult operations.
CE: Well, I certainly do thank you for the time you've given me again today. You've been very generous with your hospitality and your time and I hope that we can talk again.
DS: O.K., fine.
