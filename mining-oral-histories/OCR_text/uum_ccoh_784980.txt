6

 PETE AIELLO NOVEMBER 2 3 , 1 9 7 9 and they wanted to show that they were robbing the mine out of their weight. See, we say a car used to weigh about three or four ton, or a ton-and-a-half. They only give you about two and one-half or three at the most. So when the miners seen that, they got together, and they took it over. They steel us so much, they didn't make enough as it is. So they got together, and one morning,
they stayed around the table. They wouldn't get on to go to work. So the superintendent come up and talked to me first. I was a young man, and I didn't know how to talk too good. So, they say, "What [do you] you boys want?" "Well, we want one man out of our bunch to stay with the company, the company weighman, so they see that we get anywhere near the right weight. He called us strike, "No? We don't strike." This we want, see. We don't want a strike. So he said, "Well, I will give you a man. And you got to pay by your miners." Well, we will. We had every- thing settled down. Had everything settled down. About two days after, we see a car or two of gunmen come. We didn't know who they were. But they was gunmen. You see, the superintendent wanted to make big name for himself. Well, they had to put the gunmen ---?--- . Some of us, about twenty-five out of our bunch, we got what you call fired. They laid us off. They took us off the job. But if
I could have talked then, like I do now, we would have 7

NT: Who else did you live with then?
PA: Just three of us lived there.
NT: What were their names?
PA: Names? Let's see, one of them was named Louie Ravatsani.
Louie Ravatsani was a mason by trade, but they didn't have no job, so he was working in the mine. But there was a contractor over there by the name of Mr. Silvagni that found out he was a stonemason, and he gave him a job as stonemason.

That is not fair, but I deserved the miner pension because I got enough time in the mine to get a pension. But, it would have been twisted around back and forth, so they wouldn't give it to me.
