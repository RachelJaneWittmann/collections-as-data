 THE FOLLOWING I S AN INTERVIEW WITH MICHAEL REINHARDT, CONDUCTED BY GREG BROLIN AND RICHARD GIBBS AT GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO ON JULY 29, 1970.
GB: Thank you very much for inviting us into your home to talk to you today, Mr. Reinhardt.
MR: Y ou're very welcome.
GB: We'd like to begin first by asking a little bit about
your background.
MR: If I go into it in detail, it will take about half a
day, so I think I had better run through it pretty rapidly. I was born up here in Victor, Colorado, a gold-mining town. The strike came on and there was no work for a period of time. My father was working in the Coeur D'Alene district in northern Idaho. I grew up near it and went through grade school and high school at Wallace, Idaho. I entered Harvard University in the fall of 1922, finished my junior year, and to recoup my finances, I went back to Coeur D'Alene and worked as a miner for two years, and then I returned to Harvard and got my degree. I made up my mind that I was going to take a year of prospecting before I went out and got a job, so I went into the Cripple Creek district and worked as a lessee, and I found quite a nice body of ore. I wasn't married and the money I made out of it did me very little good; it did the town of Cripple Creek far more good than it did me. I stayed around Cripple Creek until 1936

 MICHAEL REINHARDT # 1
when I decided I had enough of Cripple Creek and small-time mining, and I got a job with the Serro de Pasco Copper Corporation in Peru. So I worked there as shifter, as shaft foreman, and as a mining foreman
for a period of six years. Then I came back to the states and worked as a supervising engineer for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in Denver. Of course, you're probably too young to remember, but it was a lending organization of the government, and the Denver office was one of the branch offices. During the war they were very generous with their loans to try to improve the metal output of the United States, and we paid out several million dollars in loans. Our little office there in Denver was the most successful one among all of them in the United States. We succeeded in getting Uncle Sam back about two thirds of his money. Because one of them, the name of which I will not mention, didn't get a dime back. So I would say we conducted quite a successful operation there. I went from there to Honduras as chief geologist for the New York and Honduras Rosario Mining Company. Stayed there for a year. I got some kind of a strange disease that's carried by bats, and they sent me home to die, but I fooled them and didn't die. I went to the Colorado School of Mines
2

 MICHAEL REINHARDT # 1
and did a little graduate work and some teaching for a year while I was recovering my health. Then I came over here with the U.S. Geological Survey and worked with them in charge of drilling in search for uranium ore in various places in the plateau. And I transferred from the U.S.G.S. to the A.E.C. as their chief geologist.
RG: What year was that?
MR: The year of the transfer was in 1951. No, it was in
December of 1951. I came over here with the U.S.G.S. and I entered the uranium business in September of 1948. So I saw the whole thing develop.
RG: You mentioned you were in charge of drilling for the U.S.G.S. and I was wondering what this capacity involved?
MR: I would choose the sites I was sent to, the general locations. Once I was on location, I chose the sites for drillers. And to help with that---?--- ---?--- was supposed to do that.
RG: Who was in charge of the choosing the general area? MR: Dick Fischer. Richard P. Fisher.
RG: Then how much of a latitude did you have in choosing
a particular site?
MR: Oh, full latitude.
RG: Was it a large area that you were given or--?
3

 MICHAEL REINHARDT #1
MR: Oh, the first one I had there was Radium Bench which
covered about, oh, four or five square miles. And then I was given Outlaw Mesa which was comparatively larger, six or seven square miles.
RG: How successful were you in finding uranium?
MR: I knew very little about it when I was on Radium Bench and the spacing was too wide. We were drilling on five-hundred-foot centers, and we found very little ore and came to the conclusion that there was very little ore in this. It was owned by a man named Sitton (?) and he sold it to a man named Delaney out of Texas, and we thought that Delaney had bought a lemon. Delaney drilled on a closer spacing than we had and found ore between our holes and he mined
about, oh, somewhere between three, four, or five million dollars of ore out of it, and later sold the thing for more than he had paid Sitton (?) for it after he had mined all the ore--not after he had mined all the ore, but after he had mined four or five million dollars' worth. So I would say that my first venture was not successful. The second one was on Outlaw Mesa. We started drilling in January and we didn't hit a single ore hole until March of that year when we drilled into nine feet of high-grade ore. And I said to the boy, "We've drilled into a log. We
4

 MICHAEL REINHARDT #1
offset another fifty feet and we won't find a thing." So we offset another ~ifty feet and we had twenty-two feet. And from then until the end of September we could hardly drill a hole that didn't have a few
inches to many feet of ore. Drilled out a huge ore body and that was actually the--Climax Uranium got a lease on it. So that was the start of Climax Uranium. And that was the mainstay of their millheads for a period of many years. So it was quite successful, I would say.
RG: How large was this ore body, do you have any idea? MR: Oh I estimated it at about a hundred thousand tons,
but when we got into it, it was much larger than my estimate showed because there were point and columns sticking out here and there that I missed. I never have heard from anybody what the final figure was on it, but I would judge that it was close to three hundred thousand tons. Now that's not as big an ore body as, for instance, Kennecott Copper out here at Bingham, Utah which is mining a hundred thousand tons a day, and they've been doing it for many, many years. And so two or three hundred thousand tons sounds like a small ore body. But it's an exceptionally large ore body for the salt wash member of the Morrison Formation in this part of the
5

 MICHAEL REINHARDT # 1 country.
RG: Speaking of formations, are you familiar with the Union Development Mine Survey, the Ben Webber report? Why do you think that this report almost totally ignored the Shinarump and the Chinle formations?
MR: There was only one area at that time in the Shinarump that had ever been productive and that was Temple Mountain. And I suppose that we considered that a freak and something that we would never run onto it again, that it was not worth while to look in the Shinarump. On the other hand, perhaps a thousand deposits all of whichá are rather small ---?--- found in the salt wash, probably find a lot more of them, and they did. That was a pretty good report, but the ideas that he worked up with the origin of these ores were out of this world, were completely false. But aside from that, it was a good report and the maps were excellent. If you want some information about that--have you talked to Tony Maskovich?
RG: We've been trying to talk to him, but we can't get to see him yet.
MR: He was on that survey, and he made the maps of the Henry Mountains, and it's still one of the best maps of the Henry Mountains. As I was speaking, it was before this old fellow Webber worked up the idea that
6

 MICHAEL REINHARDT # 1
this uranium had been washed out of the ---?--- Formation in Southern Idaho and washed down washed here, and for some reason that he couldn't explain, had lodged in the streams down here completely nutty. Excuse me a moment. Another man you ought to talk to
is Phil Merritt. Perhaps you have talked to Phil.
RG: He's in Salt Lake City, I believe.
MR: Salt Lake City.
RG: And we're going to try to contact him. We have his
address, his business address.
MR: He was over in Gordon.
RG: Yeah, that's what Ernie Gordon said. We talked to
him.
MR: He was in the New York office and he was head of all
the explorations. Ernie was the chief of the Grand Junction branch while I was chief geologist of the Grand Junction branch. So at the present time you're talking to the guy who was three steps down from the top. I guess I don't need a smoke after all. I can't find a match. Do you still have that tape running?
RG: Uh huh. During this period that you worked for the U.S.G.S. how widespread were their efforts? Do you have any idea?
MR: Yes. We were confined almost entirely to the region around the La Sal Mountains. At that time it was not
7

 MICHAEL REINHARDT #1
known as the Uravan Mineral Belt as it is at the present time. In 1952 or '53 Dick Fischer and Lowell Hillford wrote a report describing the Uravan Mineral Belt. They described it accurately, but they assigned no reason for it. They just simply said, "This is
it." All it is is a grouping of the major mines in the La Sal Mountains region, and it develops that those mines all fall within a belt surrounding the La Sal Mountains. They only make a semi-circle around them. The circle is not completed because the salt wash has been eroded from the western side of the mountains, but to the south and to the north and to the east, the belt is more or less_continuous. It isn't continuous ore, but there's a pod of ore here, a body there, a pod here, a body over there, and one right after another over a length of about eighty miles. And when you get inside the belt, you find an occasional little pod and you get outside the belt and there is nothing. There's no more ore there whatever in spite of the fact that salt wash still
goes on. But Fischer refused to stick his neck out,
and I hope it's all right to talk in this manner. RG: Oh sure.
MR: He refused to stick his neck out and assign a reason for it. To my knowledge, I'm the only one that stuck
8

 MICHAEL REINHARDT #1
his neck out and I think that my explanation is correct. Is this part of what you're interested in?
RG: Yes, very much so.
MR: I wrote it up in an article published in Engineering
Mining Journal in 1963. There were a great many people around the district who are using that article as a Bible in their prospecting at the present time. The reason that I assigned to it was that there are two main stocks in the La Sal Mountains. Have you had any geologic training?
was once molten pushes its way up toward the surface, but it never reaches the surface, and then it becomes volcanic. There are two such stocks at La Sal, but the main mass of the La Sal Mountains is made up of micrin; this is cells of this molten material that branched off from the stocks and went in between the sedimentary stratum. When you get every thing on paper, you find that the Uravan Mineral Belt makes almost a perfect semi-circle around the southern stock, which is call the Summit Mountains, and it goes a distance of about, well the belt pitches and swells. So it will range from twelve to twenty miles away from the edge of La Sals. Inside the belt there
I've had some.
RG:
MR: Then you know what a stock is? The nick of rock that
9

 MICHAEL REINHARDT #1
were quire a number of mining areas that could not be
included in the belt at all. And when I drew the lines around those, I found that they made almost equally as good semi-circles around the northern stock, and I named that the Mouth Wash Belt. I prefer to call the Uravan Belt the Southern Mountain Belt because I feel sure the source is the solutions rising from those two stocks.
RG: Uh huh. Would they be hydrothermals?
MR: Hydrothermals, yeah. There is still controversy going
on whether these things are hydrothermal or not. In my mind, there should be no question at all; they are hydrothermal. I would say that 90 percent of the geologists of the world agree with me now, whereas 3 percent agreed with me when I first started out.
RG: During this period, when you first went to work in the uranium industry, how large was your knowledge or the uranium industry as far as the reserves go, the extent of the reserves? Did you feel that there was any uranium to be found in formations other than the Salt Wash Morrison?
MR: When I first came here, I had never given the subject any thought. But the very first job I was on, I took a trip, stole a trip down into White Canyon area, and I saw the Shinarump down there and the greed
10

 MICHAEL REINHARDT # 1
bleaching similar to the bleaching in the brushy basin member of the Morrison Formation. Then I said,
"There should be uranium down here." And I didn't look for it myself, but I was not surprised when the Happy Jack was discovered and developed into big uranium. So I would say that although I did have no definite knowledge that there was ore in the lower formations, I had a feeling there should be.
RG: After your stint with U. s.G. S., you mentioned that you went to work with the A.E.C. as chief geologist, now what did this job entail?
MR: I had one many employed when I went on the job, and I hire twenty-eight young geologists, put them in groups of two or three and sent them all over my portion of the plateau. My portion did not include the Grants area, and so I didn't have anybody down there. I had one group in White Canyon, one in Junction Valley, and one over between the Green and Colorado rivers. I can't remember now just where I did have them, but I had them in groups of two or three geologists who were scattered all over the
greater part of the plateau.
RG: Many people have criticized the A.E.C. and the A.E.C.
field men for not going out into what you might call an unknown area. They stayed basically around areas
11

 MICHAEL REINHARDT #1
where they knew uranium could be found. To what extent do you feel this is true?
MR: Well, I think that this is true. The reason for that is because the object was to find just as much uranium as possible, and the best place to start is near known ore bodies. You start there and work outward. You don't go out in the boondocks where no uranium is known at all and work in towards something. I can find no basis for criticism of that procedure.
RG: Another criticism by many of the miners has been the A.E.C. field people didn't have a feel for the uranium industry, that they were incompetent in searching for uranium. Do you have an opinion on that?
MR: Well, my chief answer to that is that we found a lot of ore. For instance, Charlie Steen has said that I turned down the Big Indian district over there. He has never specified me by name, but he said that the
A.E.C. turned it down. We did not. The same spring that Charlie made his discovery, I flew over the area, the south rim region over there, I though it looked like a very likely area, so I sent Bob Newhart, who is still down here with the A.E.C. in to look it over. And Bob said, "Looks to me like it's a
12

 MICHAEL REINHARDT # 1
pretty good area. But," he said, "as far as I can tell, why, we'd only find room for about ten thousand
feet of drilling." At that time they were putting out hundred-thousand-foot contracts. But I said, "Well, they're going to get hold of this hundred-thousand- foot idea one of these times." I said, "Just put it on the shelf and do it later on when we can get ten- thousand-foot contracts." And Charlie went in there and drilled his holes and found the ore and he got the idea that we had turned it down. We hadn't turned it down at all. However, don't get the idea I'm criticizing Charlie because Charlie, perhaps by luck, perhaps by good horse sense, did more for the uranium
industry than did the U.S.G.S. and A.E.C. put
together.
RG: Now, during the earlier years before you went to work
for the A. E. C., the U.S. G. S. had withdrawn land on Beaver Mesa and done some exploration work but no drilling, and then they re-released the lands to the public domain again and these lands were then staked by private individuals, and then this area was drilled U.S.G.S. What was going on? Do you have any reason for this? Do you have any idea what was happening?
MR: Let's see if I get this sequence right. It was 13

 MICHAEL REINHARDT #1
withdrawn and the U.S.G.S. did not drill did you say?
RG: No.
MR: And then it was released and later on the U.S. G. S.
came in and did drill it after it was released and had been staked by individuals. I don't know a positive answer on that, the sure answer, but I think the answer is that Dick Fisher had a dim view of the Beaver Mesa and some of the individuals who staked these claims did a small amount of drilling and found a lot of ore. That changed Dick's views, and so he sent the U.S.G.S. again to do additional drilling. I believe that is the answer to that. I have talked to Dick about Beaver Mesa and he expressed to me the
view that it would not work there.
RG: Uh huh. What was involved with field geology or what
was your position with the A.E.C. when you were head
geologist? What were you specific tasks?
MR: Supervising these twenty-eight geologists I had out in the field. I would come into the office and compile the reports for a day or two and then I'd take off by air visiting, first this one, then that one. And then I'd have an assistant who also did
that. So we kept things pretty well in line. We knew they weren't going out in the nearest tavern and getting drunk; they were on the ball. They examined
14

 MICHAEL REINHARDT #1
the rims, they actually walked the rims and came up with drilling recommendations for the engineering department. That was all the geologist did was to
RG:
MR:
RG:
MR:
recommend places to drill and the manner in which they should be drilled. The engineering department took it from there and did the drilling.
Who was in charge of making that decision of whether or not to drill?
Well, I made my recommendations to Tom Oscar or Ernie Gordon, and he gave directions to the engineering department to get busy and do the drilling.
Did Tom Oscar or Ernie Gordon ever refuse a request for dril.ling?
No, the only ones that were ever refused were those that were too small, and I knew that it wasn't worthwhile ---?--- because it was too small. And these was another one over where the Rattle Snake Miner was later developed that I wanted to drill. I did take it to them and asked them if I couldn't ---?--- a hundred thousand feet all the way up and down the side of the La Sals with special emphasis on this Rattle Snake area, and I was turned down on
that.
RG: Whose idea or whose ideas were the hundred-thousand-
foot contracts? Why did they have to have so much 15

 MICHAEL REINHARDT # 1
drilling done for each contract?
MR: I can't tell you whether that originated in this office. I rather think it was originated in the New York office. They thought they could get the drilling done more cheaply if they had a hundred-thousand-foot contracts than if they had ten or fifteen-thousand- foot contracts.
RG: Uh huh. The A.E.C. has been accused by some of the independents on the plateau of not being able to run an operation such as drilling on an equitable financial basis. They end up spending too much money for what they did drill.
MR: Now this is partially true. The various concerns around here to do the drilling much more cheaply than either the A.E.C. or the U.S.G.S. did. That's because they don't have to keep as complete and careful records. We have men sitting on every drill measuring the stickup on the drill after each run, getting the exact depth and watching the ore come out to see what color it was, logging the core. The way the private companies do it is to instruct the driller to drill so many feet of hole in line along here, drill a line on fifty-foot centers, lay the core out in such and
such a manner so as to read it, and the geologist comes around about once a week and goes over all the
16

 MICHAEL REINHARDT #1
drilling that's been done. And so they say they' r e saving the cost of another man. One man will take care of all the drilling that's being done, whereas the way the U.S.G.S. and the A.E.C. did it, there's
one man on each rig. He had a mighty easy job. Most of them brought murder mysteries with them and spent the greater part of their time reading murder mysteries, and yet the records that we had to keep were more or less necessary.
RG: What type of drilling did you do under the U.S.G.S.? Was it a diamond bit core, or--?
MR: All of it.
RG: All of it?
MR: All of it was core right through the powder in the
holes on down. That was another thing that undoubtedly private individuals complained about, the high cost. You know about where the ore horizon will be ---?--- by the drill hole and they ---?--- down that deep at half the cost of using a diamond drill through the ore horizon. We could have done that if we had been sure that we were not leaving some ore somewhere higher in the hole. We were not sure and we felt we had to be sure.
RG: How deep was the drilling done by the U.S.G.S.?
MR: Up to the time I worked with them, the deepest
17

 MICHAEL REINHARDT # 1
drilling that was done was on the Club Mesa up above Uravan. They did some core drilling there. Under my supervision the deepest drilling we did was 130 feet. That was back in the days of shallow drilling and now they're going up to 24OO and I myself have done drilling to 1,400 and 1,500. But back in those days,
RG:
MR:
if we had a hole that was deeper than 130 feet we really had a deep hole.
What was the basic reason behind what appears to be shallow drilling today?
Nobody was sure that the ore could extend back into the Mesa and didn't think that it was feasible to drill deep holes looking for it. They thought that the cost of drilling would exceed the value of the ore, but the value of the ore is far in excess to the cost of drilling.
What type of drilling did you do with the A.E.C.? The same.
Is all diamond-bit core?
Uh huh.
What was the basic rationale behind the drilling and geologic work? Was it all primarily just to find uranium?
Well, I got into a big argument with one of the geologists. He said that negative information was
RG:
MR: RG: MR: RG:
MR:
18

 MICHAEL REINHARDT # 1
just as valuable as positive information, and I said, "Nuts." I said, "We're looking for uranium and when we get a blank hole, we get a blank hole, but it's nothing to rejoice about." He got his philosophy from Dick Fischer who said that we're trying to evaluate this and a blank hole is just as valuable as an ore hole. To which again I replied, "Nuts!" (I still want to go out and see if I can find a match. I had some here a few minutes ago, but I don't know what I did with it.)
RG: How long did you stay with the A.E.C.?
MR: I went with them in December of '50 and I left in
December of '53, and I suppose I'd still be down there except that I got kicked upstairs. I was chief geologist until, oh, sometime in--I can't remember exactly when it was--in the latter part of '52, I believe. They made me staff geologist with more salary and more title and nothing to do. So I stayed with it until December the following year. During that year, my one and only duty was to conduct some business with dignitaries around the plateau. I rather enjoyed that, but the visiting dignitaries didn't come out everyday. I would sit there at the office and twiddle my thumbs when there wasn't a dignitary to drag about the plateau. So I quit and
19

 MICHAEL REINHARDT #1
started my own business as a consulting geologist, and I've been with it ever since. It's slumped right now because of this financial recession that's going on. We're not very busy, but most of the time during these intervening sixteen years. I have been quite busy. I'm not too worried about the slump.
What was the A.E.C. doing when you left? What type of geologic work? Were they continuing the widespread exploration of the plateau?
Just the same as I had been conducting.
I have just a few odds and ends to pick up that Rich didn't cover. Approximately how many men were involved in field exploration in these teams?
Well, I had twenty-eight men and I would say that there probably was about fifty in the engineering department actually doing the drilling. Then if you want to bring in the contractors, there must have been seventy-five or a hundred drilling contractors from the mint. I don't think there were seventy-five drilling contracts going on at one time. There might have been as many as five or six or seven, but each contractor would have about ten, twelve, or fifteen employees.
You mentioned that it was the primary concern of the
Atomic Energy Commission to find as much uranium as 20
RG:
MR: GB:
MR:
GB:

 MICHAEL REINHARDT #1
possible, therefore they would look in areas where they knew where uranium existed. Did the Atomic Energy Commission with its exploration teams ever go
into areas cold without any prior knowledge of
uranium in that area?
MR: They didn't send men.in, but they flew over almost
the entire United States with very sensitive scintillators mounted in the plane and an observer on the scintillator. Whenever they'd get a kick, the would have ground crews go down and examine it on the ground. They found a great many areas. You could get the information at the A.E.C. as to how many prominent areas were found by this flying contention of A.E.C., but there were a lot of them.
RG: How would you evaluate the overall exploration program of the A.E.C.?
MR: Well, between the A.E.C. and the U.S.G.S. there are withdrawn areas at the present time that have millions of tons of ore in them that they won't lease to anyone because there is no crying need for the uranium at the present time. They know where they are. They have looked over them and have data on them, and someday they will be released to private individuals or companies. And from that point of view I would say that the A. E. C. and U.S. G. S. programs
21

 MICHAEL REINHARDT # 1
were quite successful.
GB: I have one last question and this has nothing to do with the Atomic Energy Commission or U.S.G.S., but I'm just curious as to why--you mentioned that you were with the Serro de Pasco Mining Company in Peru and also in New York and Honduras. I was just curious why a young geologist went to South America because now I understand that Ernie Gordon was in South America and Martin Gaines was down buying ore and mining ore down in Mexico.
MR: Have you talked to Martin Gaines yet?
GB: Yes. What was so attractive about South America?
MR: Oh, miners get itchy feet and they want to wander.
They want to see what's over the hill. That's one thing and the adventure is another. Another, the chief reason why I went down was because it was in the middle of the Great Depression and I could get a job with Serro de Pasco and I would have had ton continue leasing in Cripple Creek if I hadn't gone to Serro de Pasco. I was tired of leasing in Cripple Creek.
RG: Earlier you mentioned about Charlie Steen's find on Big Indian Wash. I was wondering if finds like Steen's and Pick's had any particular influence on
22

 MICHAEL REINHARDT # 1
the A.E.C. exploration program. Did they begin to look more at the Shinarump and the Chinle formation?
MR: Oh yes. Yeah. The Happy Jack was discovered before either of the other two. I had a program going down there in the White Canyon area around the Happy Jack because of the discovery of the Happy Jack. I staked all over into Red Canyon over into the north into Dark Canyon, however, there was little uranium over there. But they found quite a bit of ore in both in White Canyon and Red Canyon. When we went to Temple Mountain and branched out as far as we could from there, we examined all around the San RAphael Swell. And there was quite a program worked out at the Grants, New Mexico office. But the Shinarump, the ---?--- and Southeastern New Mexico--Las Vegas, New Mexico and the Grants office had quite a program going down there. However, they didn't find much. There's a deposit of uranium here and there, but nothing of any size.
RG: Did this program in White Canyon start before Charlie Steen's find?
MR: Yes. It started after the Happy JAck find but before Charlie's find.
RG: Do you feel that if Charlie Steen's discovery had not been made that the Shinarump would have--how much
23

 MICHAEL REINHARDT #1
longer do you think it would have taken before people realized there was such a large deposit of uranium.
MR: That Happy Jack was a large enough deposit so that a lot of interest had been developed in the Shinarump before Charlie made his discovery. And I think things
would have gone along just the same. I also think that if Charlie hadn't made his discovery the A.E.C. would have found that ore within the next two because I definitely had it in mind to drill it.
RG: It took several years for them to discover the Shinarump and the Chinle formations as ore bearing. During this period--I've mentioned the Union Mines Survey--they didn't mention it, and it wasn't important immediately following the war. How long after the war do you think the Happy Jack made it important?
MR:á I think the Happy Jack triggered the exploration in the Shinarump. I don't believe Charlie would ever have gone in there and drilled that and made his discovery if it hadn't been for the Happy jack preceding. The Happy Jack was perhaps more important as a starting place than Charlie's discovery,
although Charlie's was much bigger than the Happy
Jack.
RG: Okay thank you very much, Mr. Reinhardt.
