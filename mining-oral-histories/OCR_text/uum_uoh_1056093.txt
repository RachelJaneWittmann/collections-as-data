 This is an interview of Maurice McCabe by Kathy Biel for the Uranium Industry Oral History Proj ect . The interview took place in Mr. McCabe's office, Navajo Offi ce of Economic Opportunity, Ft . Deciance on July 31, 1970.
B: Mr. McCabe, would you mind starting out our interview by giving us a brief description of your background--where you were born, where you were educated?
M: Yes, my name is Maurice McCabe, of course. I was born in
McKinley County, New Mexico, at a little Indian agency called Tohatchi. I was born there on October 18, 1923. I attended
the public schools there, and finished elementary school at Rehoboth Mission at Rehoboth, New Mexico. From there I went
to the Navajo Methodist Mission School, at Farmington, New Mexico, where I graduated from High School in 1941. Thereafter I have attended a business school in Phoenix for three years--night school and weekends, and during that time I finished the full twenty-six
weeks of the business administration course, majoring in accounting, and business law, of course. That was the size of any formal education I have had. However, I have attended a lot of other training sessions and things of that sort. In 1954 I was granted the John A. Whitney Fellowship to the University of California at
Berkeley, which unfortunately I did not make use of, and have regretted it very much ever since.
B: All right--you have just kindly allowed me to read your employment resume, so that we can eliminate this extra explaining. Now, I'd like to get down to some of the points that I found very interesting

 B: in your resume. I'm primarily interested in your time as the treasurer for the Tribal Council that you began in 1951, am I correct?
M: That's right.
B: And you had position dealing with the dispensing and allocating
of the revenues that came in to the Tribal Council, is this correct?
M: Right.
B:
M:
Now this project is exploring the uranium industry, but I know that the Tribal Council has been receiving revenues from other industries. What other industries have you received royalities of revenues from?
Well, basically, it has been from mineral production on the reser- vation, starting out, as you say, with the uranium production, which gave the tribe a rental on the land's lease of production and it gave them a royalty payment for the uranium mined, based on the value of the uranium. It was the concentration of the uranium ores in the¥.
what was mined off the reservation. That was one source. Secondly, as I recall, when the uranium boom waned, then came the oil and gas boom on the reservation. There again was a rental of the lands
that were under lease for oil and gas exploration, and when the lands
were put up for lease sale, there was a bonus offered per acre, and
I believe that some of the lands on the Navajo reservation have been some of the richest oil promises or lease sale bonuses ever to have
been received by any tribe or perhaps, or perhaps -any landowner in the country during the late '50s. Substantial bonus payments were
pg2

 M:
made to the Navajo tribe which was a substantial portion of
their income. And then, of course, the perpetual royalities
have accumulated and th.at is als.o a source of revenue to the Navajo tribe. Then there are stumpage payments from the sale of stumpage (now the Navajo Forest Harvesting Districts) which is like unto indiscreet pay for raw materials, stumpage th.at was charged. That is anoth.e.r source of income. Then the business site leases on the reservation was quite sizable, and the inter- est on income already ádeposited to the tribes account in the U.S. Treasury was also a sizable item of income to the Navajo tribe. I'm sorry that I do not have in my possession at this time, the income statement or the operating statement of the Navajo tribal, and Navajo tribal government, as I then knew it to be, but they can be obtained and it will spell out throughout the years the
major sources of revenue to the Navajo tribe.
How did the Tribal Council come to decide not to give their people the--in other words--divide up the revenue among individuals as that Ute tribe has done and instead keep it within the Tribal Council for investment, for instance--uh, developments?
Well, the income to the Navajo Tribe over the years has built up to quite a substantial amount of money, as I recall. While I
was with the Navajo Tribe, the amount that was on deposit at one time reached one hundred and five million dollars. And even with that great an amount of money, the Navajo tribal population was
such that if the per capita distribution of the funds on deposit was made to the Navajo people, it would have been only a portion of
B:
M:

 M:
amount on deposit, and it would not have been substantial, it would not have been enough to really help the individual, even
if a per capita payment was made to each member of the family, it still would not have been large enough to be of any real benefit to the Navajo people.
Just how did you go about contracting and leasing to companies
such as V.C.A., or independent buyers who came in and wanted to stake claims on tribal reservation property? What was the procedure they had to go through?
Well, the uranium production in the Four Corners area had to be shipped somewhere to a urani.um mill, so that the ore could be milled and so that it could be processed in what they call Yellow Cape. The nearest mills were as far away as Durango, Colorado,
which was really a vanadium operation and other great distances from the reservation, so it was natural and logical that a mill be established nearby the source of the uranium supply, so that the hauling costs would not be excessive to the producers of the uranium ore. It was through this requirement that lands were
leased to, initially I believe, the Kerr-McGee Oil Industries of Oklahoma City who established a mill at Shiprock, New Mexico. There followed the V.C.A. Mill in Durango, Colorado, I believe it
was and then what used to be known as the Texas Zinc Minerals Mill
at Mexican Hat, Utah. Then later, several years later, there was
a mill established at Tuba City, Arizona, and I believe that mill was
a rare metals mill to refine uranium ores and to make Yellow Cape for reshipment for further refinement to other laboratories
B:

 M:
t hroughout t he count ry . The mills in the Four Corners area w r such that they processed ores that were west, or I should say east of the tributaries of the Chinle Wash, and anything west of the tributaries of the Chinle Wash wer e , of course , milled at the
rare metals plant in Tuba City, Arizona, which was established by El Paso Natural Gas Company, as I recall.
Just what instructions or provisions did the Tribal filounci l
place on the independent miners, or the larger companies, such
as the ones that operated Monument No. 1 and Monument No. 2. Did they have to post bonds., for instance or lease with a Navajo partner?
Well, the process of going into the uranium business was in several stages--many individuals, as well as mining companies, or specu- lators, were granted mineral prospecting permits, primarily looking for uranium ores on the reservation. The Tribal Council established a regulation which would pay a discover's royalty to the individual
who filed then for a mining claim. A lot of times the individual Navajos made discoveries and staked out claims and had them approved, and were issued mining permits. Other times the mining,,companies
or speculators or whoever else had prospecting permits and made a discovery, then had to take a Navajo Indian to obtain a mining permit. Mining permits were issued only to Navajo Indians, and
they, in turn, sub-let their mining permits to the mining companies that would do the actual mining, employing the Navajo and paying him
a discovetler's royalty. The leases were standard government leases, applying to leasing the real estate to mineral prospecting and mineral development and production of minerals. There were many

 M:
B:
M:
provisions that were good provisions that protected the Indian tribe, the individual Indians, and still allowed mining companies to go ahead and operate in such a manner as it was beneficial to the mining company, the discoverer, and to the Navajo tribe.
Among these provisions, was there a maximum wage placed on the employer, for his employees? In other words, I've heard mentioned that Tribal Council did not want the employees of these mines,
or mills, to make over a certain amount of money. Is this true?
Well, I don't really understand that they did that, but I do know that the uranium boom came at a time when the uranium industry received almost a priority in the development of up to date reg- ulations governing and regulating the mining industry on the reser-
vation; the Navajo Tribal Council has always been of the opinion and has legislated regulations that would provide for the highest wage rate, and generally that was not less than the federal minimum
wage rate, to apply to the mining operations. The Navajo tribe also took precautions in inspecting mining properties, mining operations, the mining shafts for deep mining purposes, drilling, exploration, and that sort of thing, so that the individual Navajos as well as the other employees of the mining company were also
protected from the safety standpoint.
You said also that there was a requirement passed that they had to hire 75% Navajo workers in the mines and mills.
Well, that may have been early in the game, but it came down to a point where as many Navajos as were qualified to assume all positions
B:
M:
pa 6

 M:
B:
was more nearly the correct way, as I now recall the regulations in the hiring practices recommended to the mining companies or any industrial operator on the reservation.
Do you believe that this discovery and uranium came before the other minerals? Do you believe that the discovery of this new industry that was brought into the reservation was beneficial, in that it brought many of the Indians into their first wage-earning opportunities?
To a very large extent that is true. From the standpoint of employment opportunities up to that time, the Navaj10 nation, as
such, was still a dormant giant, and the coming of the uranium began to make the tribal members aware of the potentials--potentially
rich mineral deposits on the reservation that could be developed
into employment opportunities as well as a substantial income to
the tribal coffers.
Would it be correct to say that their revenue and the responsibility for deciding the allocation of the revenue gave the Tribal Council new autonomy and infused it with a new spirit? I understand after their Sheep Reduction Program that it really wasn't quite in the favor that it had been with the people.
Well, the ±ncome from uranium was very beneficial, and gave decided impetus to the Navajo tribal government to exercise its rights
under the treaty and under the federal regulations, and beyond that, simultaneously with the coming of the uranium industry on the reser-
M:
B:
M:
vation, the Navajo tribe had retained legal counsel for the purpose
pa 7

 M:
of filing, or developing and filing a land claims cas against h United States Government, in accordance with the Indian Claim Connnission, and legi slati on by Congress wherein this was allowed and permitted by the Government or by Congr ess . Simultaneously with
that in 1947 the Navajos also became very acutely aware of the need for a general counsel, a general legal counsel, which they also retained, and it was a revelation to them as to what rights they had, which they did not know they had, and it opened up all of the areas of corrective measures and actions open, which then became open to them, and with the advent of the large amount of income from uranium, this financed the legal department, the embryo
tribal staff, to where they also took control of their own fiscal affairs. They had begun to realize that they did have some money and they began to know in simple reports that they had money in
the treasury, they had receipts for their money, they knew how much they had, they appropriated money for expenditure for beneficial programs for the Navajo tribe, and down at the end of the report they knew what new balance they had, which had never been done
before by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or anyone else for that matter. The first financial statement was developed by myself and presented to the Tribal Council in 1952.
I understand also that you were involved in labor regulations. Could you extand a little bit on that and tell me a little of the problems that you had to settle.
Well, that's a larger subject than can be just touched upon, in the áshort interview of this nature. Those who know Navajo development,
B:
M:
p8

 M:
who know that in 1948 there was appropriated some ight mill.on dollars in the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act; a program which was designed to build new schools, new roads, provide for development
of the reservation. In other words, after the War, the general public of the country became very aware of the neglect of the Indians of
the country, more particularly the Navajo people, and tried to make amends by appropriating large amounts of money to enter beneficial programs for the development and for the general welfare of the
Navajo people. There was, of this appropriation, there was a
sizable amount for new construction of schools primarily, and
roads on the reservation. Even that amount was inadequate, but
still in all, it was better than anything they have ever had before. Beginning with these school constructions, school construction and
the road construction, the problem of who--before that, let me
state that the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act, right in the Act
stated that Navajo employees or Navajo tribal members would be given preference for employme~t in any of the construction pro- jects from the proceeds of the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act, and subsequent appropriations. Well, this is what started the
whole ball of wax. At first the Bureau of Indian Affairs, through their Plant Design and Construction Department, as I now recall the name of the department, they used to design and construct
all of the buildings and federal buildings and construction on
the reservation, under what was then called the Force Account
Basis, which meant that the government allocated a portion of the money appropriated for particular construction and the government then went ahead and hired craftsmen and engineers and so forth, and
did the building right within the framework of the government or
pa 9

 M:
the BIA organization. It turned out that this was too costly and
a lot of other things entered into the picture to where the cost e~timate, cost estimates were greatly exceeded. So then they
went to contracting the projects, and in the contracts there were clauses written into the contracts which would require that
Navajos should be given first preferences for all jobs for which they were qualified. If the union contractor came in, that was repulsive to his union, and there's where he started the differences of interpretation of law with the building trade's union in the state of Arizona, and of course, the state of New Mexico. At that time, most of the projects were in Arizona, so most of the trouble
was in Arizona. Only a few years before the advent of the Navajo- Hopi Rehabilitation Program, there was passed in the state of Arizona, a Right to Work Law, which did not require all craftsmen
to become union members, and with that, with the help of that legis- lation, of the State of Arizona, for a long time we were successful in holding the union at bay, and with the use of the provision of the Treaty of 1868 that anyone except for government agents could
be exctuded from the lands of the Navajo people, the Navajo reser- vation. These two pieces of legislation, or laws of the land, en- abled the Navajo tribe to more or less enforce the requirement that Navajo people would be given first preference. But tribal admin- istrations changed; a subsequent administration may have been union oriented and unions to him, or to them, were the thing to be followed,
as far as labor relations were concerned, while another administration may have favored the Right to Work Law, and that is the way the tribe's labor policy developed up to this point. That is how it
p0

 M:
B:
M:
began that the troubles were experienced with the labor groups in Arizona and New Mexico.
Did you ever experience any labor problems wi t h the mining companies?
No--not hardly, no. They were not unionized. Later on, after the coal leases were entered into and coal production had begun, we felt that we may have some difficulties with the United Mine Workers, but it didn't develop, and I don't believe today that there has ever been any direct negotiation with the United Mine
Workers, in so far as coal mining on the reservation is concerned.
Now, you mentioned in the resume that you did a study on the resources of the land. Did this include mineral resources? Do you see anyánew developments for revenue for the Tribal Council?
Well, yes, the Navajo Tribal Council has a--or the Navajo tribe
as a sovereign nation, is of course, clothed with the authority to tax the occupants or the residents of the Navajo reservation, be they tribal members indiscreet, or whatever other customary taxable source is available to them. There are many other pot-
ential areas of income on the reservation, and I do feel that in the years to come, thes.e areas of taxation for revenue purposes
will come to the fore and will be a substantial source of income to the Navajo people, or to the Navajo reservation. It seemed to be, it would seem to follow that this ought to be done, because a
B:
M:
government providing a service to its citizens derives its income
pg

 M:
B:
M:
B:
for services to the people from taxation, so it would appear that this is inevitable on down the road.
Do you anticipate any opposition to this?
I don't know of any people who have actually invited anyone to tax them, so that also follows that there would probably be some opposition.
I've spoken to some young Navajo men who liked to classify them- selves as Navajo Nationalists, and they believe that even the
Tribal Council is too much under the thumb of the federal government, looks up to the white people too much, and follows their beliefs.
How do you feel about this, this new feeling among the younger people?
Well, the younger, just as you point out to me, your research has led you down blind alleys, and little or no information as to the background of a lot of the things that have happened on the reser- vation, beginning with the times when these very young people were a very, very tender age, in fact I suppose they weren't even in school yet, and due to the lack of information as to what really
and truly was the basis 0f a lot of the things that happened at a time when the Navajo nation was beginning to wake up and to become a motivating factor in the economy of the states wherein the reser-
vation lies. I feel that if they understood the background, that I
dare say that there wouldn't be this feeling of nationalism to the extreme. Now nationalism to me is a good thing, as has been proven,
at least during the years that I was with the tribal government. I can
M:
pg 12

 M:
recall years prior to my joining the tribe, wherein the Navajo,
the Navajo tribal government as such was very lax, very loosely organized; no money with which to do anything with, they were not the moving factor, or political force that could extract any of its
wishes or its desires from anyone. Even local county governments could do as they well pleased without any organized resistance of any sort from the Navajo people. I would say beginning in about 1948, 1949, 1950, when the Navajo people finally began to be briefed and became aware of what rights under the treaty and of the subse- quent treaties and the legislation of Congress, that they began to assert themselves backed with a good substantial income, that they began to move and become the leaders in Indian government, and thereby, there surged a pride in the Navajo government, a pride
in the Navajo organization, a pride in the Navajo will to do for himself, and with this pride there was established a deep feeling of nationalism. Where people, Navajo citizens, members of the tribe, had shied away from being identified precisely with the Navajo nation because of its disorganization, because of its lack of a centralized government and lack of a strong tribal council, then became proud to be identified with one of the best organized tribal governments in the country. In fact, our tribal government, our tribal financial system, at one time while I was there was looked upon by the federal government as the model of tribal oper-
ations with its own--within its own organization as one of the best fiscal operations anywhere.
B:
I understand most of that is to your credit.
13

 M:
Well, I thank you for saying that, but I had a lot of help in
doing that, but I've always wanted it to be that way, and at
one time we--it was actually that way--and the foundations that
were laid during those years are still the fiscal foundations on which the tribe presently operates. So when you ask me about nationalists, it was with tribal money that the scholarship
program was established. A lot of the young people who have had tribal help, or government help coupled with tribal help, began to become educated. The came forth and blossomed at a time when
there was a lot of other unrest in the country, and we knew that
when we educated young people, that in all probability, they would come forth and replace those of us who were there trying to provide for them an opportunity of higher education, and we knew all the
time that we would probably get leaders of every description-- contemporary good leadership in finance and management, in education, in all of the professions, in the trades, and we knew that there
would come forth an element of dissidence, an element off to the left, off to the right, and this was something that was expected. But still in all, we feel that there was a good understanding of
why it came about in this manner. I believe that there would be
a minimum of pulling away, and there would be a lot more effort in unifying and uniting the Navajo people into one purpose of progress in all areas of--that would be beneficial to the good and welfare of the Navajo people.
Can you give me some specific goals that you may have in mind for education of the Navajo children?
B:
p4

  M:
Well, I'm not an educator. I've served on the local school board for nine years. I do feel that I perhaps am somewhat qualified to state what I think the problems are. I do feel
that quality education ought to be the prime objective of the educators on the Navajo reservation, whether it be BIA operated schools, whether it be private schools, whether it be public school systems. I believe that all too frequently educators
come to the reservation and become frustrated at the terrific language barrier that there is between the Navajo speaking young- sters and the English language. I believe that this has been very frustrating, and I believe that the language barrier has
not been overcome and I do feel that this is an area which should be a concern to all of the educators.
Would you advocate then Navajo teachers, eventually all teachers being Navajo?
I think that is very beneficial. I think that there are a good many educators, Navajo, who have the Navajo people at heart, and who wish to do all in their ability and power to teach them or educate them. The same holds true with non-Navajos. There's
a lot of dedicated, good people who wish they could do more. But due to policy, due to length of time of instruction, due to the language barrier, and due to the different philosophies in different areas of the reservation, the job isn't getting done as efficiently as I feel it can be done. I believe that this area,
B:
M:
this area which should be concentrated upon in the years to come
p 15

  M:
B:
M:
until our kids do get quality education, and that a lot of th obstacles of language and whatever else are overcome.
What about boarding schools? Would you like to see them eliminated also?
Yes, I think that they should be eliminated, but I don't like
to eliminate them with just one swish of the hand and say, 'As
of this date no more boarding schools.' After all, these board- ing schools are traditional with the Navajo, or all Indian peoples; rightly or wrongly they were the only thing we had, and then along came the day school type operations, with the increase of children of school age, that's all we had. All along it has always been; this is all we have; this is what we must make do with. Then
how are we to say that we don't--we didn't want them at the time. It may have proved in the long run that they were not what should have been, but still in all, we don't feel--at least I don't feel that we should say the boarding schools were a bad thing. I think the intention was proper, I think the intention was right, but
I believe there just wasn't the--they didn't strive to develop a home-like atmosphere in the schools, which created the problems that they now speak of in the operation of boarding schools. Certainly, I'd like to see the equivalent of public school districts in the home areas of the youngsters, and certainly I would like to see
boarding schools for those youngsters whose parents who aáre not economically able to maintain them at home, but the good quality educational opportunity should be made available to all of our
Navajo kids.
l

 B:
M:
B:
M:
You are moving on to the Director of the Navajo Office of Economic Opportunit y , is that correct?
Th.at' s correct.
What do you forsee for employment for your Navaj o people? Are there still farms giving employment for all of them on the reservation so that they don't have to move out to Utah, or Colorado, or even further?
Well, our basic problem of the reservation insofar as employment opportunities are concerned is that in the average community outside of the reservation, ninety percent, or eighty percent of the payroll is derived from private sources, private industry and private business. Twenty percent is local government, federal government, or state government payroll. On the reser-
vation just the reverse is true. Eighty percent of the payroll
is from federal funds, twenty percent or less is from private payrolls, businessmen, and other industries operation on the reser- vation. So what is needed here is industrialization, economic development to provide jobs for our Navajo people. I believe
that with the orientation, with a concerted effort to find jobs for those who are willing and desirous of working, there are
probably employment opportunities for them on the reservation.
But when you think of the total labor force available and compare that to the j,ob opportunities, there will never be--or I should say, it is a long way off before the reservation can support the labor force it now has available.

 B:
M:
How is the Tribal Council going about actively promoting in dustry to come into the reservation?
Well, basically the Navajo Tribal Council, as I have observed
here in recent years, and I have been in the Tribal Council for several years, is that they are--their efforts have been more
or less to crash programs early, hurry and build the factory, because there is a military contract for electronic component
parts that we can manufacture here, and as long as the contract's enforced, there's jobs. Well to me that's crash planning, crash programming, any port-in-the-storm type of operation. To me, industrialization doesn't come overnight, and you must plan for it. You must have all of the components that make an area attractive
to heavy industry or to permanent industry. Those components, of course, are long-term leasing the ground with which to establish industrial plants, an adequate power supply, an adequate water supply, and adequate transportation system--rail, or truck; financing, training programs, which the government can very well assist in, and the tribe can encourage--well, at least five or six real basics like that. If those areas are developed and
brought about for industrialization on the reservation, then I would say that you would have permanent industry on the reser~ vation, rather than hurrying and quickly building a building and bringing in . . .
So then it will take much change in the administrative policy before all these components are available?
B:

 M:
B:
M:
Well, I would say so, yes. Someone who understands and r a iz
I don't think the present administration realizes the years that have been wasted.
Have you heard anything of new developments in the Navajo reser- vation? I was in your offices today and a secretary did allude to me that this has come about, but the gentleman wasn't in that I could talk to. Have you heard anything about this?
Well, the papers have carried articles about a new coal lease
made to El Paso Natural Gas Company. That ain't nothing new there-- that lease has been laying around here for ten years or more, and only that the coal not be mined for fueling a power generating plant. It will be used for a gassification plant. In other words, converting combustible gases from coal as a by-product. That may come into an income which may--which tends to become substantial, because there are millions, maybe billions of tons of coal on the reservation which can either by strip mined or deep mined. If the
natural gas reserves of the Southwest, or of the country begin to decline more rapidly than was expected, then I suppose that the Navajo coal mines would also come into their own in being mined for their--for gassification purposes.
Wouldn't this be possible for the uranium deposits that are still here on reservation lands?
I beg your pardon?
Wouldn't this be also possible for the uranium deposits that are still on reservation lands?
B:
M:
B:

  M:
B:
W ell, I s uppose that technology goes forth every day and tha sooner or later, energy derived from plants that utilize uranium fuel will come into their own, and will be competitive with other types of energy, and perhaps this will come about also.
M:
B:
M:
I might have one other question
speaking to someone in a position to know. I 've been interviewing Navajo miners as far up as Colorado and Utah, and I put this question to them: 'Are you aware of the mining royalty that came into the Tribal Council from the uranium on the reservation~'and they weren't aware of the revenues at all. Can you explain this?
I have no control over the dissemination of the financial income of the tribe. When I operated, I had a concise report which was printed up, and which was made available to the Navajo people. Much the same as you were to go into a bank at the end of a quarter and pick up a small resume of the statement of condition of the bank. That's the type of thing I used to get. I'd--at least it was factual~ it didn't have a lot of details, but there it was. But I notice that they don't do that at all anymore, and I don't know why they don't do it.
Then they musn't be aware that they can come right to the Tribal Council--the men who have lived off the reservation for maybe two or three years.
Well, I can't answer that, I don't know. I hate to say this, but i.t's not my responsibility anymore, and of course, I've got
á and anyone who comes to me and wants to know, I ' d other interests
I was hoping to clear up by
p0

  M:
B:
M:
B:
be glad to tell them, and I have done so, but as my prime responsibility, it isn't.
I just thought maybe you had an answer for that. Well, I want to thank you very, very much for taking out time from your busy schedule to talk to me.
Not at all.
and let me record this interview.
