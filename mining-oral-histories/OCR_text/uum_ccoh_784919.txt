 T H I S I S AN INTERVIEW WITH IV AN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER IN PRICE, UTAH ON MAY 4, 1982. THE INTERVIEWER IS NANCY T ANIGUCHI. THIS I S PART OF THE CARBON COUNTY ORAL HISTORY PROJECT.
NT: Elda Vee Alger is Ivan Lambson's sister, and she originally came to consumers coal camp in 1926, and later on she was followed out there by her brother, ivan and his wife Edith in 1929.
EA: NT:
To begin, I would like to explain that I'm doing this for the American West Center, at the University of Utah, and they transcribe the tapes, and then I'll get a chance to check them and all, so that's the main purpose of it. As you notice, Carbon County doesn't exist in the history books, and it's time that it did. The fellow that I'm working for, you may know him if you've been in education, his name is Floyd O'Neil, and he used to teach at Helper Junior High.
Yes, I know Floyd.
Then he taught at the high school, and now he's up state. And of course he's from Carbon County. He wants to make sure that we get some history from down here. So that's the main purpose of doing this. Now, I think we ought to start at the beginning. Now none of you are from Carbon County, is that right?
I'm from Missouri.
Y ou're from Missouri, where?
I ' m from the southern point of the state, both of us. They came from Paiute County.
EL: NT: IL: EL:

 IV AN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4 , 1 9 8 2
NT: From Paiute County, huh?
EA: Oh yes, that little bit of a country.
IL: If there is anything you want to know about Paiute County, Vee and I could tell you about it.
EL: We've only lived here 73 years now.
EA: Now, in this little thing I've done here; I don't know,
NT:
EA: NT: EA: NT: EA: NT: EA: NT: EA:
NT:
I don't know whether you'll want any of it or not.
Well, let's save that for later. Right now I'd just like to talk to you. Is that okay?
Okay.
What year did you come?
I started teaching 1921, and I came here in 1926. And you came to Consumers, is that right?
It was Gibson's Mine then.
And who owned it?
Gibson, Arga Gibson; A. E. Gibson. Yes. And how did you get the job?
I sent out an application to Carbon County and they sent me a contract.
Was it advertised in the paper, or did you hear about through friends, or what?
EA: No, they just ---?--- I didn't know anything about Consumers, and I didn't know anything about any of the towns in Carbon County, and I think that everyone was horrified to think I wanted to come to Carbon County. But
2

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982
NT: EA:
NT:
EA: NT: EA:
anyway, I did, I wanted that very much and so, when I got, I had four other chances to teach in different places, and I sent out my applications. I could have taught in Beaver, or urn, I can't think of the other town down this way. Anyway, I wanted to come to Carbon County,
so I came.
Why did you want to come here?
Because it was metropolitan, and I wanted that experience.
And when you got up to Gibson's Mine, was it what you expected?
That ' s what this explains.
Well, tell me.
In the first place, I had no place to stay. In the first place, I didn't know I wasn't going to have a place to stay, and Blaine Thompson and I had been assigned to Jordan Creek, to Gibson's Mine, it was called. And he roomed with Mr. Gibson's son, and the people who had to, had built little shacks here and there--
Yes.
--to live in. But uh, well I, they said, "Well, you can go to ---?--- . " The superintendent told me, and so I looked up Rose Warren(?) and she ---?---, and she says, "Who's he, that he can send anybody up here? I wouldn't keep a school teacher for any price." So I had the man
NT: EA:
3

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982 take my little tin truck back down to the store porch, and there I sat. I was going back to Price, on the mail run. I was just waiting for it, and the butcher came out. And he was a man from Ferron, and he says, "Miss Lambson, we have a house that has two rooms, we built, and it was really the nicest house up there, see; always was. He
says, "Our daughter has gone down to Castle Dale to school, so, I think that we can keep you." So I went up and somebody must have told Mrs. ---?--- because there was nobody home, but there was nothing for me to do but unload my little tin trunk, and my box of school supplies, because I had a lot of them. I'd been to ---?-- -, schooling them, and the University, and I would get an awful lot of material, you know. So I sit there, and sit there and sit there, and pretty soon I saw a lady coming down the street, and cross over, and she says, "Who are you?" And I told her, and she says, "Well, who's he, that he should, that he's got a right to tell somebody they can come and live here." And you can imagine what that would do to a person. And I said, "Well, I guess you can't very well send me back tonight; the mailman's gone." So then Mr. Talbert came home from work, and they moved my trunk into the girl's bedroom, but I was not wanted, you know.
NT: Yes.
4

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982
EA: Of course I was always looking for some way out, and finally I was so unhappy, and it was almost Christmas time, and Ray and Terry Kalley(?) had built a little house, but they didn't even have one bedroom. They had a front room and a kitchen .
NT: Yes.
EA: But Ray let me sleep with Edna, and he slept on the
floor, or the couch, or whatever it was, while they built me a little shack. This shack was built from the boards taken up from old flooring. You could see where the dogs had gone, and where everybody went. So I had them, I had some real good friends. I had Lee and Meryl, and they go busy and papered it for me. And I cleaned it up, and it looked pretty nice, and I had a little stove in there, but I couldn't. And then I boarded with Edna and Ray.
NT: Edna and Ray who?
EA: Kalley.
NT: And who are Lee and Meryl?
EA: Lee and Meryl; the one is the man I married, and the
other is his brother.
NT: Oh, I see. And I wanted to ask you one more thing; you
said you came up with Blaine Thomas, is that right?
EA: No, Blaine Thompson.
NT: Blaine Thompson? Is he also from Paiute County?
EA: No, he was from Ephraim; he got on at Ephraim, him and,
5

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982 oh, who's the girl that's taking care of Mrs., for heaven's sakes, names there, right there, but I can't say them. She's taking care of Mrs. Stubby.
NT: EA: EL: EA:
Peter's son?
Yes.
Oh, Ruth Bernardi?
Ruth Bernardi. Ruth and her husband; they weren't married then, they were on that train. Blaine was on that train
that I came on, and I was on that train, and Blain went up there with me. Blaine was a swell fellow to teach with because he never lacked for laughs.
So you came up by train, all the way up from where? Where did you get the ticket from Salt Lake?
Well, my father took me from Paiute County down to Marysville, and I boarded the train at Marysville .
I see.
And I had had a serious operation, and so it was nice that I had two weeks to lay around in, more or less. Fixed my little cabin up.
Who was the superintendent of the mine when you f i rs t came up?
A. E. Gibson.
It was.
Yes. He owned it, and he was superintendent and then, uh, the superintendent of the schools was uh, say it Edith,
NT:
EA:
NT: EA:
NT:
EA: NT: EA:
6

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982
say ---?---'s name. EL: W oodriff.
EA: Then this was Woodward, his name was superintendent W oodward.
NT: EA: EL: EA: NT: EA: NT:
EA:
I see.
Isn't that right?
I think so.
Yes, it was Woodward.
So, when did you come; you came in 1926, but what month? It was September.
In September. And you finally got in your house at Christmas?
Well, I'd bummed around, boarded where I wasn't wanted. I hadn't moved into the house just before Christmas, yes. Because I remember that we went to town and it was the night before, uh, Christmas. It was the night before we were to go for vacation, for Christmas vacation and Meryl gave me a great big package.
Yes.
Meryl Alger, he was my husband. When I opened it, it was a big, uh, it was a big, and mother said I couldn't keep it because men shouldn't give me clothing. And it was housecoat, one of these chenille ones, but oh, it was nice and warm.
NT: EA:
EA: Oh, it was cold, yes. And once they had dig me out; it 7

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982 had snowed so deep that I couldn't make it out of the house.
NT : What year were you born?
EA : NT: EA: NT:
EA:
NT: EA:
IL:
NT: EA:
1900 .
Well, that's easy to figure, isn't it?
Y es.
So then, what year did you start to teach, you said in
1921?
In 1921, yes. You see, we had to go over the mountains in Cedar City to ninth grade.
Yes.
Now, you feature a ninth grader, and you know I think I was pretty brave, why, we took my brother--my father took my brother and I, my older brother, and we kept house. I guess Mom did most of the cooking, I don't know. Anyway, in spring he ...
---?--- could do the very best, as I remember when we were kids, was to make candy.
Oh, how nice!
Oh yes, I made $75.00 once with my first grade in Circleville; see I had four years teaching before I came out here. And we made, we needed books, so we set a hen, and she raised, uh, I mean they had her ---?--- hatch at Easter time and we gave her an Easter party. And I had neighbors, we had lived by the boys that did the
8

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982
NT:
EA: NT: EA: NT: EA:
orchestra work, and they played for the dance. That was just delightful, we made $75.00.
So you said you went to Berkeley and to the University of Utah, is that right?
Yes, and to Cedar City.
For your schooling.
Y es.
You're talking about Berkeley in California?
I'm talking about Berkeley in California; that was when it was a really good school. And there were these teachers from Chicago there. They had a series of books out, but it was never very popular, I don't think. Smidley(?) and Olsen. They came and taught this class, and they took a liking to me for some reason, I wouldn't know why, and gave me all their materials. So I had two big boxes full of them.
Oh, that's--
--Gorgeous. I still have some. And today when I ---7---
up there teaching, do you know what was in my room, that I had... My easel--two of them. And that was kind of fun, to see them being put to use; I left them up there when I left, see.
Where were you today?
Up at Durant.
Oh. What years were you at Berkeley?
NT: EA:
NT: EA: NT:
9

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982 EA: Oh, it was 1920 . I came back and taught first grade and somebody else that wanted it. But they gave to me and
that was i n, what that was Louise W hittiker(?), and she wouldn' t teach i f she couldn't have that first grade. She was rich, she didn't need it.
EL: You know what; was it before the war?
EA: Yes.
EL: Around Circleville?
EA: In Circleville. I taught first grade one year after I
NT: EA: NT: EA:
went to Circleville, and then after I went to Berkeley, and then ---?--- came home from the service. When I signed up to teach in Circleville, why I had already signed up to teach in Beaver because they told us that we shouldn't go back to our home towns because there was too many people mine own age, or anybody's own age that didn't take the opportunity to go to school, and that there would be friction. But I never felt it; di d you , Ivan? I was just welcome with open arms in Circleville . But I wanted to get my degree, so my brother came from the service, and came home.
This is in 1918?
No, this is in 1920. Okay.
.. . and then he , this is in 1920 ... something , it would have to be. I went to Consumers in 1926. So you see it
10

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982
was about 1921, when I went to Berkeley.
EL: Was that a summer or a winter?
EA: That was a summer, that was a summer up there. But boy,
it was really worth, you know? It was really worth it because one thing that I got every ... , thing you know, he was real interested, and he knew his way around, and so ...
NT: Why did you stay up at Gibsons Mine if you had so much trouble in the beginning; why didn't you just pack up and go home?
EA: Because I've never had the desire to quit something I've started. You know, and after all, I owed money. I had to have that serious operation that year, and my brother had paid the doctor and the others had paid the hospital, and so I owed that money back to the family.
NT: Yes.
EA: I was living at Billings, and they paid over, well it was
an emergency. I had a ruptured appendix. NT: Oh, dear.
EA: And I didn't take care of it, and I served to a party that night, and was so sick, and everything. So I was in debt, and I had to pay these debts off, see?
NT: Yes. So Mr. Lambson, how did you come to Carbon County? was it on account of your sister being here?
IL: Well, partly.
11

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982 EA: Yes, we rode in (illegible ... )
IL: Yes, they wanted me to come, and I (illegible ... ) NT: April of 1929?
IL: It was in 1929, you know, there wasn't many jobs. NT: Yes.
IL: I don't guess you remember.
NT: No.
IL: But in 1929, the jobs were just as hard as they are going
get to be in 1984. NT: Yes.
IL: You just look ahead, when 1984 comes, you'll remember, it'll be 1929, all over. There was a job there for me. Then I came here to work, and I stayed with my sister and brother.
NT: EL: NT: IL: NT:
IL:
So what year were you married?
We was married in the spring of 1927.
I see.
In Farmington.
Now when you came up, what was the job that they offered you?
Well, I was working on the temple. As I got a little better acquainted with the work it was just then as it is now, as you got better, why, they gave you a chance at a better job. And I got to where I had pretty good jobs. When the United Mine Workers came to Carbon County, and
12

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982
I had to, I joined up with United Mine Workers, when I
had to take a cut. NT: Really?
IL: Yes, ma'am.
EA: During the depression, now this is how good the school
pay was ; you worked for , my school , I had ---?--- , and the first year I started, I got $80. a month. Then I worked myself up down there to $90, and carne to Carbon and they gave me $90. I was worked up to $110, and then the depression carne and they set me back to $100 , to $85 .
NT: What year did you get set back?
EA: What year would that be, Edith?
EL: I don't know; I started at $80. in 1929.
EA: In 1929.
EL: I never was lower than that.
EA: Well, I was sent back to $80, $85 from $110. Can you
feature all that?
EL: One year they cut you, they cut the school year short one
month, remember, that was before I carne; it was 1928. EA: Yes. Because they couldn't afford to pay it.
EL: They didn't have the money to pay the teachers.
EA: You would go into a job like teaching school and there is
so many interests there. There are all these people. NT: Yes.
EA: So you don't worry much, just so you're living. 13

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982 NT: Yes. So Mrs. Lambson, how did you start teaching school?
EL: I had an uncle who lived here. Mr. Doyle. NT: Yes.
EL: And he ran (town wagon) here in Price, and my mother's brother, and they, like Mrs. Alger said, "You can't teach at home; you had to go somewhere else because you can't teach the kids you grew up with, and so on." So he said,
"If you're going to have to go away from home, why don't you apply out here?" So I sent my application in and got a job in Carbon County. But I had no idea where I was going. I got here in August of 1929, and I went to Raines. We had three teachers; LaNore Kimble, who was Mrs. Charley Madison's wife, and he just died.
NT: Yes.
EL: Ann Strand and I were the ladies and then Mr. Wynn was
EA: EL:
our principal, but when we got up there, they hadn't paid the miners since March. Everybody started moving out to get jobs somewhere else. LaNore Kimble went to Columbia, and I went to Consumers, but there was no schoolhouse.
(illegible ... )
(illegible ... ) had a building and I didn't. There wasn't a building for me. She had a building, and Mr. Anderson had a building, but there wasn't any place for me, so I visited in Price for two weeks, all the rooms, and did nothing, almost, until they could get me a building
14

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982
built.
NT: You mean that you each taught it like a different, or set
of grades?
EA: No, we had different buildings.
EL: I was to teach third and fourth.
NT: And what grades?
EA: Well, I taught the first four. I had taught the first
four, but now we were expanding, so they brought a new
teacher in for third and fourth, you see.
EL: But there still was nowhere to stay. So I was supposed to
stay with the doctor and his wife.
NT: Who was the doctor up there?
EL: Dr. Meryl?.
NT: Yes.
EL: Not the Meryl that used to be at Hiawatha...
IL: The one that was in Brigham City.
NT: Oh.
EL: And his wife, I guess didn't want me because she left and
went home to her mother. Well, I couldn't very well stay
with the doctor by myself.
EA: I did Mr. Talbo.
EL: Well, what was her name, that took me in, and I slept on. EA: While you went to ---?---.
EL: ---?---, as she was a postmistress, and she said, "well,
until the doctor's wife gets back, why you can stay with 15

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982 us." All they had was one bedroom, and I slept on the couch. And every night Mr. Polk(?) made out my bed in the living room.
NT: Oh, my goodness!
EL: And then by what, I don't know, it was quite late in the
EA: NT: EA:
NT: EA:
EL: EA:
year, and the doctor came and said that his wife wasn't coming back all year. I didn't know; Polks(?) only took me in temporarily, and I felt like I was a nuisance to them. So Mrs. Alger got her husband to consent to let me come there. Ivan fixed the back porch, and he slept on the back porch, and I slept on their couch. They only had one bedroom.
---?--- house, and the ---?--- had running water.
Oh, that's good!
And a bathroom; they were built for the superintendent in the early days. And so I got out of the little shack, and we had the house.
How did you get that house instead of one of the miners? Oh, that's (illegible) ... and everybody else. What was his name, what was that superintendent's name?
Kirk Badwick.
No. Was it ---?---, well he says, "Mrs. Alger, you want a house?" I says, "Oh, I sure." He says, "Which one of these?" No, he says if this way, he says, "Which one of those apartments?" See, they built those apartments, and
16

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982
he says, "Which of those apartments do you want?" And I said, "I don't want the apartment, I want your house." He says , "Okay."
NT: When did Mr. Gibson quit being a superintendent?
IL: Oh, he sold the mine to Blue Blaze Coal Company, and Blue Blaze Coal Company, the main people in the Blue Blaze company was Travis and Radis. And Travis was the President of Tintic Standard(?) and Radis was Vice- President, and just the other way about. Radis was
President of Consumers, and Travis was Vice-President;
Blue Blaze Coal Company, that's what they called it.
NT: And did that coal then go up to the Tintic District, to
IL: NT: IL:
NT: EL: IL:
NT : IL:
the smelt that ---?--- there?
No, it went everywhere.
Yes.
When I was working there, weighing coal and we sent 140 railroad cars ---?--- to the consolidation of ski resorts. The ski resorts all belong to one outfit.
You mean the ones up here in the Wasatch Front?
Not now, they ...
Well, I don't know but Sun Valley and the one over by Denver and others all through the ---?---; there wasn't any Park City then, that was a mine at that time.
Y e s .
But there was a ski resort up at ... oh, geeze, ---?--- had
17

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER a cabin up there but it wasn't a...
EL: L ittle Cottonwood? IL: The one that ...
EL: River's Bottom?
IL: Big Cottonwood.
MAY 4, 1982
EA: IL: NT: IL:
NT:
EA: EL: IL: EL: NT: EA: IL:
EA:
It was L ittle Cottonwood Canyon.
That's where ---?---'s cabin was, I know.
So all those ski resorts ...
Yes, they all belong to the same outfit. And when they'd send you a slip to bill coal for uh, maybe they'd tell you to send 10 cars to Sun Valley, maybe 10 cars to over by Colorado Springs or wherever it was over there. And anyplace they needed the coal, that's where you sent it. Right. Sure. Where was the main place that they sent the coal, though; was there any one major buyer?
It was...
---?--- such a big operation ...
Wasn't such a big operation as now.
The horses pulled the coal out of the mines.
Oh, they did?
Oh, yes.
Out of that Consumers' Mine. Now that's the only one I know anything about.
Well, My husband started to work at Sunnyside when he was seventeen.
18

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER
MAY 4, 1982
NT: What year would that be?
EA: He was two years younger than me.

1919.
1919?
Because he was born in 1902.
And so then , when did he leave Sunnyside ,
Gibson ' s?
Oh, uh...
He worked at Hiawatha. He helped take out that chunk of
coal that's in the state capital.
Maybe; I don't believe it's there anymore.
I think it is; I've seen it.
Is it still there? Well, he just told me that he helped get that.
Yes, they took that out as number one (unintelligible) ... They had to be so particular about the chipping and one thing and...
Yes, and he said to get it out; you can imagine how careful.
And I think that Sunnyside and uh, then he worked at Peerless, then he walked over the mountain.
To Consumers?
To Consumers. And we were having a dance, and my brother- in-law would come in and he said, "My brother's out here ." We was having ---?--- at my schoolhouse, my school

Yes.
We did that every Friday night.
Oh, they had ...
And well, anyway uh, what was I going tell you?
About your husband? He walked over the...
He walked over the mountain, and Lee says, "I've got a brother; I'd like to have you meet him, but he sure looks
a mess."
He'd walk over the mountain. Well, they had a church in the, LDS Church, in the schoolhouse.
Yes, we had the LDS. We were talking about that down at
Prayer Meeting the other night. Mrs. the big lady that lived by you, you know: She lived up at Sweets those years. Oh, who is she?
Who's there?
She lives up there where Judy used to live. She lives in one of those houses along that street.
Down here?
Yes. I was thinking about. She is a widow.
Old Mrs. Trian.
Yes, Mrs. Trian. She says that she can sure remember coming to church all the time to the schoolhouse, and what a beautiful place it was, after they got it built. After they built a school?
20

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982
EA: A fter they built a schoolhouse. Oh, it was just beautiful , and it had ...
EL: Well we thought ---?---- ...
IL: Well, they built the schoolhouse for all three camps at
National. National is where the canyon forked; the right
and the left fork .. .
EL: ...---?--- Sweets and Consumers...
IL: Sweets went up one canyon, and Consumers went up the other canyon.
EA: National built uh.
IL: The North Fork of the Garden Creek was Consumers.
NT: Yes.
IL: South Fork was National, or was Sweets and Gordon Creek. EL: And that is what now, where Beaver Creek...
IL: Yes, that's where Beaver Creek Coal is now.
EL: Sweets is where Beaver Creek Coal is
NT: I see. When did they finally build you all a schoolhouse there?
EL: I taught one year and then I got married and quit, but I came back in the fall because my husband came back up there to live. I went down and helped them out at school because I didn't have anything to do.
EA: Oh, I had 62.
EL: There was 30 in second grade besides a first grade, and
all in one room so I would go around and help. 21

So when did you get the schoolhouse built? The nice one, the newone?
It was built the next year.
In 1929.
1929?
Not 1929, it was 1930, or 1931. No , 1930, 1930, or 1931.
Now, that surprises me because you said when you came, they were laying off the miners because there weren't jobs to be had.
Oh, but every bit it would pick up again, in the season when the coal was needed.
Oh, in the winter?
---?--- in March, and then we were married in May after that.
I see.
Then I didn't come back to teach because he was working on the farm.
What farm were you working on? Down in southern Utah.
Down in Paiute County?
No, in Garfield.
Down in that little bitty place of ---?--- Best fishing in the world .

A few years ago.
Well, why did you go back there to farm; I thought you had a job up here on the temple?
Well, that was just in March, when the ...
They laid off the single men to give married men better work.
They used to do this all the time. In the spring you got
laid off , then you came back in the fall .
And they took the schools away from you when you got married, teachers, and this is an interesting thing because I was up, the school was taken away from me, and
I had no job, year after I was married. And that was 1927?
And that was 1927.
Yes .
And they hired a Miss Byrd(?) from uh, Provo, and she would go home every Friday, and sometimes she would get back on Sunday, or on Monday, but quite often it would be Tuesday or Wednesday. Charley Leger owned the mine then. Didhe?

So you got your school taken away?
They uh, ...
Charley Leger was what, the superintendent?
Yes, and he was also on the school board. And he at the -
--?---. So I was established in that school, and they never did take it back away from me.
Well, its a good thing that that Miss Byrd from Provo didn 't work out, huh?
I don't believe that Charley ever owned the mine, I think he was just the superintendent then that ---?---.
Well, that could be, but I didn't know who owned it. Wasn't it Blue Blaze Coal Company?
It was Blue Blaze. I went in there to find my little nugget that says Blue Blaze Coal.
I could not find that book that I had. I know I've got it, but I didn't know where .
Anyway, Charley got me my school back.
Well, I didn't even go ahead and finish my education. I only had two years when I came out here to teach, and just a junior college. I had graduated back east, and so I thought, well, after I was married, they wouldn't let me teach anyway. Well, each year they would get a teacher to come up to Consumers, and she'd never show up. So I 'd
24

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982
teach that year, and uh, how many years did I teach? About 10, because no teacher would come up there and
stay. It was a funny place.
EA : Why don ' t you te ll her about your house in the dugout? EL: Oh, Ivan built a garage; he dug, for our car because up
there, when it snowed, your car--you couldn't even find it, in the morning. It snowed so deep. And so he made a dugout, back in the hill, and boarded it up with---?---. And put a floor in it, and he had the car there then. And my sister and her husband carne out, and they boarded it up in the front and made a house out of it. And they lived there that one year, and then they left. Well, uh ...
NT: When did they come out?
EL : They carne out in 1933.
NT: Yes because there was no work back east, I guess.
EL: Oh, because I was out here, I guess, and Mamma's brother
lived out here, and so the family carne out.
IL: Her dad always wanted to come west.
EL: And we had bought property in Miller Creek, and dad was
a carpenter, and he carne to help us build the house. And then my brother-in-law got a job up there, and they were living up there. Then after they left, we lived in the house down here at Miller Creek, and then weekends, we l ived in the , or during the week, we lived in the garage.

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4, 1982 And Mr. and Mrs. Alger had a fire and burned their house; Mr. and Mrs. Alger and two kids and Ivan and I all lived
in that garage. With no water.
IL: But it was a big, little garage.
NT: I hope so!
EL: Well, we lived there until they got their house fixed. EA: And we made.

twenty-two, twenty-four feet long.

Oh, geeze ...
It had slabs on the roof.
Dirt.
Yes, well, the slabs would be one layer laid one direction, you know, with the ...
Oh, he made it good and warm for the car.
Then we put another layer up on top of that, and put them in the other direction, and so it was thick.
Oh, over a foot, huh?
With the lumber and this black paper, and stuff. Oh, it was comfortable in there.
I wonder how we ever lived in there.
Well, now while we're telling about hardships, I think
26

 IV AN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER MAY 4 , 1 9 8 2
that we ought to mention what a job it was for those
children to come from Sweets, over.
EL: Oh, I wanted to tell her that; go ahead.
EA: What dear?
EL: Because these kids had to walk clear from Sweets mine
through all that snow and mud and everything over so, we started making cocoa. We had a big pot-bellied stoves, you know, about so high; I had to tip-toe to reach the top. And we had a great big dish pan that we made cocoa and ... , who made, who heated the hot dogs? You or Mr. Anderson, I don't know, but anyway, we got to serving the kids; I think this was the first hot lunch in Carbon County, really.
EA: I think so too.
EL: But we would serve those kids hot dogs and cocoa, and
they had a hot lunch, or a hot drink if they brought
their lunch.
EA: Sometimes it would take them until after recess time to
thaw their little pant legs out. I would take their shoes off, and take their stockings off, and it was just impossible. And one morning after--this was way after, the village had, the camp had gone to pieces by this time, and there was no people living, only ---?--- and a few up above. And I looked out of the bedroom window that one morning, and there were those two kids, trying to

 IVAN AND EDITH LAMBSON AND ELDA VEE ALGER
fight a drift that had drifted during the night. And it was a good thing that I was there, because I pulled those kids out of that drift.
It was awful.
Boy. What years were the kids keep coming over from Sweets?
Well, they always did.
They always came from Sweets and Consumers and National; they'd just had that one school.
See, they'd built that schoolhouse down at the foot of

Yes.
But this was before that was built; when we was living in

Separate buildings.
Separate rooms. There were outside toilets, don't forget that.
---?---- have a toilet or a tap on my side of the road. No, you didn't have anything, did you?
No! They had to go clear across the road.
To get a drink of water.

They were just like a house without any partitions in them.
But then when they would be on the inside of the house at night. You would be on the outside, without one. Just like a picture show.
I guess everybody knew their neighbors pretty well up there.
Well, we were a very close-knit family.
And we still are.
Yes, they still are. ---?--- that didn't make any difference, what if somebody's doing, even if they were laying off, had the best job in the world, they would all quit and go to that funeral, that day.
We are still sort of like a family, it was just the end. ---?--- was the last one to die, from up there.
Huh. Now, pardon me.
I've seen people that I haven't seen in years and years and years, go to funerals. Everybody that could get there, that had ever lived in Garden Creek or Consumers,
was there.
That's amazing, that you all got to be so close, like that.

Or to Price, whichever they ...
But they'd bring the high school kids down on the bus, even then. They would get snowed in, and they'd have to keep them down here for a week at a time and bring them up on the caboose of the train on Friday.
Who ran the bus line up there?
Eddy Morton was the school bus driver for a long time. There wasn't a bus that accommodated people.
Just the school.
To get the mail.
You got up the best way you could. The mail and then the people.
If you didn't have a car, you were sunk.
Now Coal City, there was some people down there that brought stuff up too.
I'll bet the Milavitches could help a lot, because they lived in Coal City, and all these Milavitches, they...
