The first ten minutes. of this tape were not recorded because of technical difficulties. During the first few minutes that were not recorded, Mr. Kazzie told us of his early life, that he was
born right there in Cane Valley, and he told us a little bit ab.out his accident, Mr. Kazzie is now permanently disabled, paralysed from the waist down. This was the result of his ace- ident he had while working for the V.C.A. as an ore hauler, app- arently as he wasá trying to make a sharp turn, the brakes gave away, and he fell with the truck of.fa thirty foot cliff. We then as.ked him ab.out any other accidents that occured around
Monument Number Two.
KB.: Can you rememoer any other accidents happening in the mining
to anyone else?
NK: One got killed by a tractor. Let me try to remember. The trac-
tor turned over on him. Also there was this White man. He was
an ore hauler. He took off without any hrakes and he tried to jump when he couldn't stop the truck, but unfortunately he was thrown under the truck and got smashed up. There's another one, one man got shot.

How did it happen?
I think he was drunk, it happened near the mining area, right where the supervisor lives and the mining. Some men were afraid of him and were trying to get in a car. The supervisor had a gun with him in his ho.use. I think it was a 30-30 gun and some men were sitting in the front seat of the car and one was seated near the edge, and he got shot. His name was Tom Hall.
Whyá did he shoot?
The man that shot the gun was a little bit off; .he had a mental problem. The man '.that got shot was a worker there. I think he was related to him or something. The man that shot him went into the supervisor's home, I guess, and shot him with his gun. I think they were afraid of him because he had a gun and the men were loading into a truck with the supervisor when he shot that gun at them and killed one man out of that truck.
KB.: NK:
IIB: Was that a Navajo that got shot?
FC: Yeah.
HH: Do you know about when that happened?
NK: I can't remember. That was before I got hurt, I think, I can't
rememher.
KBá What was his supervisor's name?
NK: Glenn--I forgot his last name. There was another one name Jack.

got a new supervisor, a White man.

do work like hauling or something else. FC: How much did you make by the hour?

in a hospital over at Albuquerque. I had a lot of people listening to my story and doctors and so forth, and word came back about these bad conditions, so how things are better.
