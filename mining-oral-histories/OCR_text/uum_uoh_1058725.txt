 THIS IS AN INTERVIEW WITH MR. RAY HUNT, AN INDIAN TRADER, FOR THE UNIVERSI'TY OF UTAH AND CALIFORNIA STATE COLLEGE. THIS INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE AT MT. HUNT'S TRADrNe POST IN BLANDI'NG, UTAH ON AUGUST 12TH, 1970, AT 'FOUR I'N THE AFTERNOON. THE TNTERVI'EWER rs KATHY BIEL.
KB: 0kay, Mr. Hunt, I'd like to begin the interview by having you te!1 me a little ~it abeut your, background and your family's background, and where you were r-aised, and how you came to this area.
R,H: Well, I went t(!) the reserv,ation when I was seven years old. My folksá owned and operated the trading post at Tesuque.
KB: Ge ahead.
RH: And I went to school there with the missionaries for three years
at Tesuq-ue, and after that we s-old Qff ----?--- and went to Mexican Watelr. We were the.re three or four ye.at'.'s, but we bought a home and we lived in---?---, New Mexico.
1$: now '.Long ago was th.is that :your family had the trading post at Tesáuque p0s:t?
RH: Well, i:t wa.s about nineteen h.un.dred and ni.ne ¥
KB: How long ago was tb.at?
R H : 1 g o .9 .
KB: That must have. been before. the Hearst family took iát over.
RH.: Well, it bel0nged to Hamm Noll, before my Dad and Burkduster--
a fellow named Burkduster, and they bought the post. Later we sold out to Burltduster and bought Mexican Water. But, it was owned and operated by Hamm Noll for years and years so it was

 HUNT: PAGE 2
about 1910 when we sold out at Tesuque, and went to Mexican Water. We were at Mexican Water the year that the big fl0od on the San Juan River took out all the bridges at Sh.:tprock and all
the way through. That was in 1911.
KB: And you can remember th±s flood?
RH.: Oh yes. We were out at the reservation at the store during the
time, but we went in shortly after that. We had to cross the
river, and the b~idges were all gone.
KB: How did you cross the river?
RH: Well, we ferried across with boats. When they lost the bridge,
they, put :tn a ferryboat run oy the. l'ndians. The lndi:ans would feirry you back. and forth~ We'd. usua,11.y swim the. s-toc.k over and tie. the wagon bow down. and towed them over, set them up, and then go on. So it'd take you a couple of days to get across the river. But since then they~ve put this Navaj0 Dam in up there, and we
hardly ever have those. big floods l:i:ke that anymore, because it takes care of half to two thi.rds of all the flood water that was in. the San Juan. The. San Juan used to just cause a lot of trouble, a lot of hazard . Shi::prock was nearly flooded away that
year and a lot of Farmington and Aztec was flooded away hays-tacks, and hoirses, and cattle, and chi'ckens, pigs, and everything was

going down river.
KB: Tnose people really couldn ' t afford that, could t hey?
Rl'I: No, out they've g0t a~y from all that now. All your lowland
r.iver- b0ttom now ts all Being farmed because they never have them
h'i:g flo0ds like they had years ago Before that dam was Bui lt. KB: And how long were you at Mexican Water.
RU:: We wer,e at Mexican Water until about 1216, and we sold out again
to Charley Ashcroft, and moved ha.ck to Fruitland. We were in Fruitland for about a year, and then we bought Anetli. Trading Company, at Aneth, New Mexico, or at Aneth Utah. And we live at Aneth, Utah for anothe.r th:r,ee. ye.ars, a.nd in 1921 we moved to
B.luff, Utah. My-father bought the San Juan Co-op. He owned
a,tid ope.rated that until :i-t burned down. That was abo~t 1952. A.fte:r that time, why, I had c;1 trading post at Mexican Hat. I ra.n i:t for several, years, and then I sold out and le.ft, a.nd then I just went on to the reservation working for various places, va.r:i:-ous stores. I worked i.n Mexican Water, and I worked at Dinneh.ots. I worked at Olj etub., I werk.ed at Aneth. -- yes, at
Anetn,, and also down here at Montezuma Creek, but I put in the longesát time at Gallup for ---7--- and McAdams. Then after that
I moved back to Bluff. In 19.35 I went to work for Harry Goulding down..at Monument V alley.

 HUNT: PAGE 4
KBá: Oh, you did?
RH: And r worked four year for him, at which time I met myw:ife.
She was i'll Flagsta!f, Arizona, She and I got marriáed, and we worked fer about a year for him after we got married. Then I meved back to Bluff and r started that trading post at Mexican liat, the one that be.longsá to my br,other now.
KBá: 0h, your brother owns that? Yes, we were down there the other da.y, and we talked to him.
Rll: I'.' sold out to him and th.en 1 moved over to Shosh.i.nko, over at
Black Mountain. We were over the.re. for twenty-four years.
During this time, schools. were quite a p:roblem, and we had a .,,---?~..-- course 1:o1." a couple. ef years, a.nd that got to be a little ti':i:esome, so we brought us a home man (1} blend. That was twenty--
~ ! , twenty-two years ago, and I've been here ever since. But r own,ed and operated a trading post until just re.cently,. Well, about six years ago I sold out. But I also worked at Luke. I
was there a couple years f'or the Badger Brothers Trading Company, and helped bring Esther out áof it, and then I went to Indian Wells, and ran that for a couple of years.
KB: Now you mentioned schooling. Now-, just what type of schooling
did you have while you were being raised on the reservation?---?-s:--
R,H: Well, after attending two or three years of school at Teec NosPos

 RUNT:
PAGE 5
wrtfi the missionaries, why, from then on my father moved his fami:ly to Fruitland, New Mexico. We stayed there unti:l school
was out, and the minute scho0l wasá out, then we'd go back. on the peser-vati'Cm and s-tay for the summer. Then we'd move back there in the. winter-- school in the winter months.
n: We'7e yo1,1 able to pkk up Navaj0.,..- the Navajo langua.ge?
'RH: Well, I just more or less kind of g~ew up with them. My brother
wa,s much younger than I was so I stayed quite a bit with. the Indian k:tds-. I just picked it up. I di-dn't try to learn it, :;i:::t. jusát came automatically-.
KB: Now, l understand :tt's a difficult language, though., not so easy t0 learn?
iUI: We.11, I guess ::i:t is, and they- clai'm i.t i's, but it seems e.a,sy to me: 'Because, I guess, I grew up with i.t.
Kn: Does this come in handy wi.th your dealings as the Jáusticesof.-:tne Páeace?
RH: Wel,1, yes it does because 1 worked all over this northern part
of the reservation tráom Sh.iprock almos_t to Tuba City, so I'm acquainted wtth all the Indiansá -,---?--- especially up around
Anet}):_ a.n.d Montezuma Creek: -.---?---, Oljetoh, Dinnehats-o, Chilchin-
oi.tu, Kayautu, and all those Indians. The. want to go to me for every--lec3;st little. They come to me all the time for advi:ce

anyway, and I tried to help them, and I've done a lot for them. rt wasá while I' was :tn.terpreting for the state of Utah over some o:tl ground down here at the Aneth Oil fields where the Navajo tribe was suing the sátate of Utah for the royalty money on the school sáect±ons. S0 we held about a three month trial h.ere a.B.'Out three years c:3.go, and I was the interpreter for the s-tate.
KR: N0w, "What was involved in thi:s trial?
rut: Well, it was..about twelve million dolla.rs worth of royalties
that the state of Utah ts supposed to reserve from the oil,landd mtn.e.va,l rfgh.ts on. the school sections. The Navajo trib"e was tr-y:j:n_g t0 prove that they had the access to this ground and
thi:s particular a;rea before. thi,s wa.s made a law. Th.e law
wa,s. ;t:n nineteen hundred and two so we were trying to get witnesses-- oh, fi-'om people who had lived in this area, or around it. I
!in~ll-´' w:ound. up being brought into it as a witness beca.use when
I came in---first came down to Bluff, my grandparents
li'Ved in Bluff, and my uncles lived there too. We vi"si'ted from Cleveland back down to Bluff. That was in 19-.... about 1911 that I came th.rough this same disputed are.a. There were Navajos
and !nd±ans both in there when 1 came through there in 1911.
A.nd, of course, l don.'t know what was done in 19.02, or before
then.
KB.: What was the outcome of the case?

 HUNT: PAGE 7
rut: Well, the outc0me--the case has never been settled. It's still pending in Wasli±ngt0n. After we had ab0ut nfne weeks or ten weeks or ar,gument in trial cm the case :tn Cortez, they had 54 witnesses, a.nd then after they finished up over there, we came oacR. over to
Monttcell0 for the last two weeks, and we had a lot of Utes as ntn.e.ssesá. We als.o had Brother Lyman up here and my father, and several of the. elder people who had live in this area.
i<n:: AH for: the state of Uta.M
Rl.[: Elvador Lyman was very val,ualHe.
rce-: H.e:'sá the hi'sát0rtan of the area, :tsn 't he?
rur: Yes-, and also his fathe.r. l'hey b0th kept a. diary of all the
ha.ppeni:ngs in thj:s part cf the country ever since. they cam,e to ~J,ut;f! A,nd it ~s his testimony, and hi,s..--he had dates a.nd w:i::tnesses. on the. recordsá_and everything was quite valuable for the sátate of Utah. But it wasn't till he found out that the Indians were lying about i.t all that he finally con.sented to tell his side of the story, just for the record so that it would
tfe kept honest. And a;fter the tri,al, I asked the lawyers just
here not long ago what became of it, and he said it''s still pending in Washington, and liable to be there for years and years because they~d rather just hold it up not settle it all until the time-- unti'l. they get ready, I guess.. So anyway, there's f!;fte.en m:i::llion
dollars tied up in escrow ri'.ght now.

 HUNT: PAGE 8
KBá: And you acted as interpreter fer the court?
RH.: I interpreted for the court, for the state of Utah. The tribe
ha,d their own interpreters for the- tr,i:al for the Navajo tri:be. Titey- had three or four that were. :interpreters, but T was the onl.y, one that the state had.
KB: That must have been quite time-consunrtng for you.
Rl{: Well, i.t was quite interesting to listen to the s-tori'.es that the
old time Navajos teld about when they lived there and all about :i,'t, An.d c;ome to find out, they had taken a whcle group of them back to Wasldn_gton a couple of yeairs- Before they had the trial, l:i'efot:"e they ca-me to cou1rt. An.cl tlls lawyer, Lattel, who was
a,cti'n.g as the head lawye.r for the. tribe had them back in Wash...- tng.ton., an_d had school.ed them on what to say- a.t- the t-rial here
i'n Cortez. l't was during one of their wi:tnesses when they cross.,.. examined them, why she said, "Well, J. told you just what you told
me to tell. i::n Washiángton," and so we were qui.ck to get onto that. M.d we tound. out tb.en..--we asked them how many went back to Washington, and they, tded to stop iát. But they had a.il been back. the1re, all. 54 witnesses had been back there, and. had had an i:nterpireter, and was told wha.t to say and when to s.ay, and what year, that this was all supposed to ha,ve taken place:~
KB: :n must ha,ve been quite an expense to the Tr:;lbal Coun.cil t0 tin~nc~ this .

l{ll: RH:
PAGE 9
Well tt was, :tt was. But this tribal lawyer, he was the one that was---he wasá the one that would ha.ve profited oy winning the case. Well, of cour-se.
He. got ten percent, and he was doing ±t all on his own. The triiJ:te was again.st the whale thing to start with, and they didn't want--they didn't want to have i:.t orought before a hearing in
th.e trial court. B.ut being.their lawyer, he said it was up to h:un t0 do i:t foir them becaus.e he.was their lawyer, and they had htired him, and he was going to see that they got their royalty
money, from i-t, but--
Kll: Was he a. Navajo?
RR: No, he was a White ma,n--a lawyer from Washington. But he was the
on.e who S"tood to make a,hout three million doll.ars..--that 'sá from tlle deal. So during the trial, why, the last week. of the trial,
why, they ;finally got to consent to the. Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Tribal Council, and they fired Latte!. But we went ahead and finished the trial on out. After he was taken out of the court, his lawyers under him went ahead and
wound it up, there in Cortez, and the state. b.rought their
witnesses back over to Monticello because the ground is in Utah:.á KB: Now, am I correct in understanding that the. Tribal Council was
originally against bringing suit against the state of Utah?
RH.: Yes, th.ey were originally against it. It was the lawyer himself

 HUNT:
:PAGE 10
who insái:sáted on the trial, a.nd I guess it was up to him to pay the cost of it t00, from what I understand, because he said
i:n the beginning of the trial that the tribe d:tdn''t want him to pir,ose.cute i:t, but he felt he was duty bound to the Indians since
he was their advi.sor, and legal counsel--their legal counsel
and their lawy-e.r, and he wa,s going to go ahead with it on his own. KB: Why do you suppose the Tr~bal Counci:1 was r:eluctant to bring a
sui:t?
RH: Well, I thi:nk. they were re.luc.tant to bi;ing a sui.t beca.us:e the
state ef Utah. has been very goo.d to the Indians and to the tribe. They've given oil royalties..--money to them.. They've done an awful lot for San Juan County.
~ ,: Wa.sn.\t th:i:.s- annexati.on traded tor land they held previously? RR: It was tiraded for the land th.at was- inundated oy Lake Powell,
so they gave them tbis--
KBt We.ll., actually thl..sá is much more valuable land that was given
to tb.em. wi'.th th:ts oi1. on i:t.
R.Hz Y'esá, I should f;,ay so. Tha.t I.and a.long the rtve.r. you couldn't
even get down to for hundreds of mi.les. along thesáe. And I don't think there was proba,bly over a hundred acres of U..t ground that
was ~Jiooded by the lake on the Navajo side. The Piute farms
is the only placer kn0w of, and I. don't think. there's over two or three hundred a_cres altogether th.at was worth.. a nick.el. They

 PAGE 11
They gave them thousands of acres. up here at ---?--- Mesa, part ef AtietIL They gave th.em an awful l0t of ground for that. But the state 0f Utah hasá d0ne an awful lot for the Indian, for the Navajo.
I.CB: Uh, you mentioned here Harry Goulding, and I'm very interested. ~'1n got-ng to be. goi'ng down te see him tomorrow, in fact, to ask h:.t1l\ a,~out when. Luke or0ught in h±gh grade uranium ore to him,
and showed :tt t0 Harry Goulding. This started the Monument Valley mbling. Do you know any more ab0ut that?
RH: Well, theáre have oeen a lot of stories- about various ways that 01;e. was found, a.nd this and that and the other. I do thlnk
that they did bring in some oire to look. at. But on the. different
ámt-ne.s th.at the ore ca,me from, it di,d turn out to be. real valuable. t<:.6:: Ha.ve you ever talked to Mr. Goulding about this parti.cular inci'dent? Rll: Well, I was at Mexican Hat when Mr. Goulding came to the. company.
And he stayed at Mexi:can. Hat tor a few days before. he moved on over to Menument Valle.y. I was running the store at Mexican Hat when he f:t:rst came into this country, and then after I ran the store there for a while,.I left and I visited with Mr. Goulding sever-al times. He. was ltvi.ng in tents dowrL~in ttite:cfaats-áivh.e~e
h.:ts present post is rtght now. And then 1 went back later a.nd wo1'l<.ea for hiJll for s.evera.1 years. But I was..--r- took sever-al par.ti~s tnto this place where the discovery- was in Mon.ument

 lIUNT:

KB: You mean the s-urvey pal'.'ty?
Rlf: I: to0k the two btg mining c0mpani:es in there to look at the ore
fie-fere they-e-ve.r, leased i.t a,nd started working tt. The. B.C.A.'s we~e the. luck.y bi:dders, and U.s.B decided to let them h.ave--go ahead a.nd have th.at over there, and theytd take some that was
rn Colorado. But both parties were there. at dlilfferent timesá.
Kll: Did both bid to the Tri.bal Council?
Rll: I' don't ltnow--yes, they bid it. They bid the ground.
!Ot: flow did you know whe:i::-e to take the;m to what place?
RR: Ind±an guidesá.
l(B.'á; Endi.'<1.n gu:i:des1 And they brought ore in to you?
Rll: 04, yes. Yes, i.t was a known fact where it was. It was known
r:i:ght whe;re they got it. They had taken---had taJten seve:rat people :01. and $hawed them wher,e they found tite ore . There was a bi'g tun.n.el. It l0olted lil<..e: that yea-rs ago. Maybe the. Spaina.rds, or :1 1 someone, had been i:n there an.d done a little. mining of some kind, proo.ably looking for copper, or gold, or something. But there
wasá a tunn.el :tn. the.re back quite a little ways, and it was when you climbed, when you crawled back. in this tunnel, it must have gone b:act, :for, oh, fi-fty or sixty fee.t. .And thi.sá had been ha.nd-- it had b.een man..+made, th_e tunnel, and it was in this tunnel

that you c0uld see all thi~ ore. And so---?--- I took these people and went right in.
Was this parttcular land any one Indian's grazing allocation? Well, I don't know as to any one Indian. There were a lot of Indians living in that valley.--what,.s it called?
Caine?
áCame Valley. It was called Caine v¥_lley, and the Hedaqua:is
lived thet.'e, and 0h, a lot of different Indiáans lived in that area. And, 1 don't knew rf any o! them, any partiácular one of them claimed it. I think the tribes were the only ones th.at recej:ve<l any r0ya1ties- from that pa.rti:cular mine here.
So t.b..e 1?.c.A.'s. did not have to stake the_s.e particular claims n'th a Nava,jo, '-$.:uch as..,...-~?-.,....,... an.cl the miners had.--
No, not a ;first, not at ;first you didn 1át. It wa.sn 't required
that you have. the Na,vajo until later, and I don't th.ink there was an.y Navajo in 0n. Gne--One or Two, e:t:ther one. But after th.at -.,...-7.,....,...- you had to have a Navajo to stake the claim.
KBf
RH.::
KR: Md yet this land must have belonged to some fami.li-e.s?
RH: Well, it be.longed to the trtbe-.,...the tribe's ground. So i_t belonged
to the community as a whole, T. don.' t think any on.e individual owned :it. Of course, there'd probably be a lot of them say they di:d. But if anyon.e belonged to it, it was probably old

RH: KB: RH:
Edaq,uai, or someá of hi.s fami:ly.
Are they still living in the area?
0h:., yes. Theyá still live there. They still live on the. ground, a lot of them.
I went out there a couple of days ago, and the only one.s I could ;fin.d at home we,re two Yaqui familiáes--They-.re Yaqui:s. One was i:njur-e.d i'n the mine and i's paraJysed now-..-and his cousin.
Well, the old Claw family--they call them Clives.
Clives?
They were. in there for years and years, and they're all related. They 're inter,marri:ed and theyir:e. re.lated to the Edaquais and the CU-vesá,.
HUNT: PAGE 14
KB: Wa.s this Clive family any relation to Albert Clive who lived ne:a11; l}i,an.di'.ng, do you Rn.ow? Cause I know that they cal,led him names .
R}L: W,eJl, yes, I imagine. so because---?--- Clive, and then there was another ln.di:an that lives in that part o;f the country for quite
a wfti:le. Re was--oh, I c.an't thi'.nk of hiB last name ri:ght now. 5ut his:.ll.cune was Bradley..,...,..uh, I can't think of it right now.
But he was educated""'-ub_, he. was a. br0ther to the Claw famly.
They call him Clive, Qr Claw.
KB: When you wei;r;e the.re at Mexican Hat, were you there while B.C.A,.

 HUNT: PAGE 1 5
started actually mining operations in Monument Number Two? RH: Yes, I was. Iá was the deputy sheriff at the San J'uan River
Bár:tdge f0r about four years, guarding thiás stock pi:le of ore be.cause you see, they had to have--they 'd haul ±át i'n--they 'd haul :tt in trucks, and then they'd dump it on the other side of
the river, and then they had a small truck that took tt, brought small.er loads across the river because they put a load limi't on the. bt;idge, and they wouldn't allow thesáe big trucks to cross w±th these big loads.
Kll: That's that small bridge that's still the.re next to the. new bridge? rut: Ye.s, tl:)._e swing:ing bridge. And so they had what they called a
pickup tr.ucR, and they'ád just stay there all the time, and they s-tayed there with me at Mexican Hat. They'd haul small loads bac'lt- and forth, and then the bi-g trucks would c.ome down to
Mexi"Qan Rat and l~~d up and go on back to the-...-go out with the oreá. While the big trucks were bringing it in.,on the other side, these little ones just carried it back and forth.
KB: Where did they take the ore in the larges trucks? RH: Well, they--

thein di-d a lot of pawning and a lot of them had open credit. Weá clla,:iged to all of them, knowing..--knowing most all of the Indians that worked there. Of course, when that mill was firsát quilt, they came from all over the reservatf.on to work there.
~ - - - - - -TT_.oe,r,e musát have been at least three ~ár four hundred of them. :((B: In the m:tll itself?

KB: How many would you estimate were working in the mine, or as ore
haulers?
RH: Well, the mine was..--the mine itself was an open pit mine.
Klt: Uh huh.
RH: Tlle.y went in and just opened it up, and I think they had that
KB:
contira.ct-..-some contract. Also, they had one--.-another big indus- trial 11'1.ining company, and Oljetoh opened up a big mine down there, and that was all open pit mine. And that was shipped to
11ex:;t;can Hat.
But can. you estimate at all howá ~ny Nava,.jos were employed at
Mon.ument Number Two Mfne when it was in full swing?
RH: 'Altogether..--altogeth.er when that mine was in production at
Oljetob and theá work tha.twas go:ing on at Mexican Hat and everything,
I imagine that there was close to a thousand Navajos employed. I,<Bá: Now, mos.t of these Navajos, previous to the mine. being opened..--
was their main livelihood sheep and dry farming?

 lID'NT: PAGE 19

I was- also a railroad claims a.gent, a.nd we would try to--we would get calls from the railroad board to send fifty or a hundred men to the railroad. And it
was up to the traders to talk. them into going~-to take these di:-fferent jobs. They hated to leave families and go away to work because. they bad never been-....they 'd never been off the reservation, and they di:dn't know what it was going to be like.

go back. Finally, it--work got so critical--such a shortage of men: working that they decided to freeze the--freeze all the workers on their job, you know. Well, when the Indians heard them talking about freezing them on the job, a lot of them didn't understand it. They couldn't figure out what they meant by fre.ezing them on the job. So they talked it over with them and on a Friday night, they all left, just took off., and came home afoot. A l0t of them walked all they way from--some of them walked all the way through. And they didn't understand what
i:t was. They didn't--they thought they was going to be there from now on. They didn't know how long they'd be f,rozen on that job, or bow long they'd have to stay there.

RH.: Yeah, they thought--see, they figured someone told them that once you 'áre frezen on the job, you '~e got to stay right through t:: the war. Well, they didn't understand and I told--1 told a lot of pe.ople that~-fellows with the job of trying to get--to solicit help, and everything. I sai.d, "Whenever you tell a Navajo that you're going to freeze him on a job, why, he.'s going to quit

home, they'll all come home. You might put them all in jail,
but they'll all come home."
KB: In other words, it wasn't work that--
RH: So then they explained it to them later that they weren't actually
frozen there for the rest of thei.r lives or anything, they just wanted to hold them a.s long as they cot.illd and enc.ourage them to stay. Well, a lot of them did then after the Geneva Steel was shut down, and they went on to the railroads. The railroads employed hundreds and hundreds of them, until they finally--
it was, a novely to them when they first started out. A Jot of them tried to make money at it, and then they got to drinking and a lot of them wound up coming home worse off than they left, and
a lot of difficulties arose from it. Now I don't think they even
have a railroad---?--- anymore.
KB: You say you extended credi.t to the families while these men were
gone? RH: Oh, yes.
KB: Uh., were you ahle to collect on the credit when they came back? RH: Oh, certatnly.--sure. They we.re your own people and your own--

ones that you let have more than th.ey can--if you let them in
toe d~ep, they can't pay out so they run away from you. They don't want to pay it. But several years ago, I had probably had two or three hundred Indians on my open account, and I explained to th.em this way, "I don't ever cut you off, you cut yourself off. Whenever you fail to pay within a reasonable limit of time, or don~t ever pay_me, th.en you don't ever get anymore credit until that is paid. So you just cut yourself off, I don't do
f.t, you do f.t." And there's. lots of honest Indians, but these people up :i:n thi.s part of the country, they--they've had to leave the reservation on account of no work, and they've moved :tn a.t Blanding, and they've dotte:d Westwater, and married and raised tbeir families. here, and it's pretty hard to get rid of th.em now.. Lt's home to them. The.y never did have any stock. They de.pended on work, and everything. That's why quite a few of them are on welfare now. But you give him the least chance to malte a little money, and he'll quit welfare.
KB-: You believe that?
RR: Ah, that is at leas:t the. able-bodied ones w ill. There are some
of them that are on we.lfare. I don't know. I don't have nothing to do with. it, or I'd have them all on i.t because I'm in sympathy with them to that extent. But a lot of people here in town think

 HUNT:
PAGE 24
that they're all on welfare, which is wrong. They're not. And right now, you can hardly find anyone here to do a day's work for you here in Blanding because they're all in the bean fields working. And whenever there's jobs close around Blanding here, in---?---, ---?---,or---?---, or---?--- or anywhere where it's only a
day's ride from Blanding, why, they work good, and they
work out all sunnner long. Then in the wintertime, the only reason that they go back on welfare or anything like that is there's nothing. There's no work for them. And they've got to live.
There is a prohlem with the drinking, and I think that that drinking
problem should be--done through in a school of some kind. They-- they do have AA meetings here. They have a Navajo in charge, and he gets up and shows them some pictures, does a little talking.
He~s a Navajo and I know him.
KB: Do you think it's a very successful program?
RH: I don't think that it's very successful, and I don't think that
it's doing a bit of good.
KB.: What about the Church of the early America, the native American
church, with the peyote?
RH: I think your peyote people are two-to-one better off than the ones
that drink. You take all your peyote people and they believe
in making a living, and they believe in taking care of their money,

 HUNT:
PAGE 25
and they helieve in having something. You take all your peyote users and peyote people that's over on the south side of the reservation, not so much in here, but over around Gallup and
in there--you can te}l that--you can tell the drinking people
from the peyote people just easy 'cause you see them come in, and they're well dressed, and they're clean. You'll ask one of the traders, "Well, how2coma2ht1.'-seeitm..=;t@,)hav.eá_'.quite a lot of money?" 11Well, yeah, he's a peyote--he belongs to the peyote clan, and they spend their check for something that will do them some good." And he said, "You take the fellow who's a drinker that gets his check, and come nightfall, he's b-roke, and someone has to hail
him our of jail or something to get him back on the job again."
But the peyote users are not--and they don't--they don't use
peyote everyday like the w:ino drinks. They''ve got--they think they've gotáto drink all the time, while the peyote users, they only going to th.eir peyote meeting when they have their ceremonials and things like that. That's. the only time they use it. They don't like people that drink and they don't want--hardly want
to ass:ociate with them. The person that drinks who don't belong to th.e peyote clan, he don't like the peyote users because they
won't drink with him. KB.: They're not any fun.

 HUNT: P AGE 2 6
RH: Yeah.
KB: I'd like to go back a little bit to a point you made and explore
it a little farther. You were mentioning when the Indians started working for the railroads and the mines that all kinds of problems arose for them besides being able to handle their paychecks and wanting to come back to the reservation. Did you see any conflict between employers and the Navajos, or any problem the Navajos encountered working with White men?
RH: No, I never--the Indian people are awfully easy to work with. A
lot of people think that they are hard to understand, but they're not. They're easy people to work with and they will do anything that
you tell them to do. And their--and as a whole they're good workers, and they're plenty smart figuring out how to do it the easiest
and best way. I guess, in cases, the educated ones that have dropped a lot of their old traditions, I don't think have become as trustworthy as the older people because the older people had to he in order to--to keep the credit and keep their families intact and make a living for them. Where the young people, they
work a little while, and move on, and now they're scattered all over everywhere. Oh, I think that the drinking problem here with these Indians here--as a judge, I hate to see him brought in for drunk--for drinking and for fighting and what not, and the you

say, ''Well I'm going to teach him a lesson. I'll give him a
hundred dollar fine." It only works a hardship against a family. They only have such little to live on anyway, and they'll spend their last nicke to go get him á.out of jail. They'll take their welfare money to go get him out of jail, and I just think that
like I have done here, fine them twenty or thirty dollars I told them I would not accept any money that came out of their welfare. They's go have to work around town here, and bring me their check until they got their fines paid. And I think that's done them more good than--and I have three of four right now pending. Well,
they've got two or three tickets against 'em right now. You could put them on the county, you could put them in jail, they could serve their time, and they turn right around tomorrow and do the very
same thing again, and then he's back in again, and then the judge says, ''Well, I'11--I'm going to learn him a lesson, so I'11 double his fine, or triple it---?---." It only works a hardship on the family, causes the little kids to go without, and I just think
it's wrong, as a judge myself. I've been with the Navajo people
a long while. I think that understanding, and I think that there should be AA meetings held for them, hut I think that there should b.e sáomeone conducting th.e meetings that could get to the people that

 HUNT:
PAGE 28
they're working with, instead of just getting up and running a
film, and tell them what the damages are, and this and that and
the other. It's just like watching a picture show. You go in
and see it all, and come back out and think about it and go on.
It doesn't do the good as if some person was there to tell them,
to humiliate them, and explain to them that they were hurting, themselves and nobody else and try to help them instead of trying
to condemn them and punish them for something that's-""".it's a sickness. And they've been on it, and they get rum-dum,1. and they're used to drinking this wine and everything. I've got a couple of cases corning to me this evening. I'm sure that's all it is
because the book's been throwed at them so many times that they're-- they just--well, naturally they hate to go to their father, or
their mother, or their cousins or someone who will raise the
money somehow to get them out. And once he's free, he then no
more cares--he just figures they're duty bound to get him out.
And they'll get him out somehow, he knows. So they haven't corrected the cause atáall. And some of them that I h~ve talked to here, and some of them I deal with here all the time, why, they come and
thank me, and they say, "Well, we've quit drinking, and we don't"-- And now some of them, the welfare people, have cut them off the
welfare, and just--the money--not giving them any money at all,

 HUNT:
PAGE 29
just issuing vouchers that they owe each trading post or each store, and give enough--give them vouchers to buy food stamps.
Now that might be one way of cutting down on the amount of drinking is when you take this money away from them. But you still won't--have got to help take care of those little kids.
You can't make the little kids suffer for what their parents
are doing. And this Solsi bunch up here, the little kids run down here to me, "Well, where's my dad? Where's my mother? It's
eleven o'clock and they haven't come home and there's just the four of us little kids up there alone." Well, we don't know what to telláthem. The only thing you can--just, "Your folks probably
will be home pretty quick; Just go on home and stay, and I'll see:if:~I-:.e.an:f.:iridá:t:.h-em~á"::-.a.nd?.a:_lQt~ofá:t:im~s '.I do_cJill g.ro.u:ndáá1so see if .they're around. And sometimes they're just visiting, and will go home. So that's--that's the deal here in Blanding.
KB: Have you ever had any other kinds of problems in criminal court with Indians--a major crime such a stealing, or--?
RH: Well, they-
KB.: Do they ever get involved in this to any greater degree than
mayhe the white population?
RH.: There is some stealing and shoplifting going on all the time, but
as I say, as a whole, I don't think your Indian people is as bad

 HUNT:
PAGE 30
as your White people.
KB.: I underst@.n.d that--
RH: Not near as bad.
KB: --that the Indian will only take from someone he feels has more
than enough, and he will only take what he needs at the time, and
usually doesn't steal to sell for money--steal items to resell-- RH: I've had em steal things off me right here.
KB: You have?
RH: Yes, they steal beads from me all the time--all this, that, and
the other, but it's only small things they're getting here. It doesn't amount to enough to get alarmed, but I understand some of these stores have lost quite a lot of stuff. But they're certain bunches that'll go in just for shoplifting. They get
what's kind of a kick. Now the Whites did it, and the Indians are quick to grah anything that the Whites do. You take several years ago when I owned a trading post over at Chilchinbito when I first
went over there in 1944. I saw an Indian girl or women ride up to the store and get of her horse a good six, seven hundred yards from the store, for fear she might show some part of her leg
getting off of the horse, or getting back on. And they'd leave their horse off a half a mile from the store to get back on for fear mayb.e they would show part of their leg, you know, which

 HUNT:

would be---which would be really bad. And now right today, when the miniskirt came along, these little Indian girls are not to be outdone by any White girl in town. They go right along with it. So you see, that's the sudden change, but itts all in the young people. But the older people, the older ladies, they still want to stick to their modesty pretty well. And they say, well, they just drink and they might do anything when they're drunk, but as a rule, they have certain standards of living and they go by and they--they're pretty strict at it. But this younger generation, they--they're quick to catch onto what any of the White kids do. They're gonna do it. Now the white kids have got a bunch that
are swiping, stealing, and vandalizing, and things like that for kicks. A lot of them are doing it for pure simple orneriness, just for kicks, and the Indian kids will catch on to that and go right ahead and do the same thing. So it'-s .just a trend that's going on right now.
KB.: Oh, does this occur, then, more usually off the reservation than on the reservation, this type of adapting White behaviour?
RH: It don't think you see too much. I don't think you see too much of it on the reservation. It's mostly the border--the border reservation, the towns that are on the--like Cold Brook, Flagstaff, Gallup, Cortez, Blanding, and towns where the White

 HUNT:
PAGE 32
kids and the Indian kids go to school together, and they're competing in the same things together. And that's where you
see more of it. Now you take on the reservation when they come back out there, then they're at home. They--they feel secure at their home, and they--they're not worrying about having to beat the White kid to this, or this kid to that, or anything like that.
Im: Uh huh.
RH: And you can see the problem right here in Blanding, where these
young girls and boys and, of course, I think you have a few gang fights and one thing and another right here in Blanding, but it's never gotten out of hand, and ain't too bad. The Ute kids sometime will have a little gang war once in a while, but--
KB: I understand the Utes and .Navajo kids will take after each other before either one will take after the White kids.
RH: Yes, they will.
KB: Uh, getting back to Mexican Hat, did you ever have any of the
Indians--you say they came into you for counseling and advice. Did you ever have any come in and complain to you about treatment they had received in the mines from their employers?
RH: No, I don't think that I ever had any. Well, a lot of them were fired for various reasons, but I think that they had that coming to them, but I think that most all th.e employers that worked on

 HUNT: PAGE 33
the reservation were pretty good to t he Indians , pretty good to
the Navajos . And I think he was pretty , wel l ,--pretty understanding with some of the men with some of their employer s . Because the
same fellow would be at the same place for several years at a
time, and if he was too bad, he would have gotten rid of him.
And the traders--the older traders, I don't know about the younger--
'bout now, right now--but anyway, when I was on the reservation,
we did all the letter writing for them to their children that
were sent aw.ay to school. They'd want us to write a letter to
find out what they were doing, and they'd get homesick for the kid, you know. Then the kid would write their folks a letter, then they'd bring the letteráin and want us to read it to them, what
did he say or she say? And then you'd tell them, and then willá
you write a letter back? And they were always sending the-- KB: You were pretty husy, weren't you?
RH: Yes, my wife was writing letters all the time--oh, I don't know
how many thousands of letters she's written--four. And they expected it of you. You're the only one that they can turn to
that will do it for them, that understands them, that's got any interest at heart for them--is the trader. And then they'd buy things out of the store and we'd send it to them. And they'd send
blous:es and shoes. I wish I'd kept some of the letters that I--

 HUNT:
P AGE 3 4
that I'd had. They'd be pretty valuable now. And, "Please will you send me five dollars. I need this or need that, or¥¥¥" And they'd say, "Well, we don't have it, but can we borrow it from you?" And so they do, we lend it to them, and they send it to their kids. And then when they're getting ready to go to school, why they'd outfit them all out with clothing and everything and lots and lots of cases, why--it would just get put on the book, or on---?--- or something until lamb season, or wool season, when they get something for what they own, sell, to pay you back.
Were you familiar with the maximum wage that the Tribalá Council uh¥¥¥placed on these b.ig corporations? In other words, they said, "we don't want you to pay your employees over a certain amount
an hour." Had you heard of that?
KB::
RH: No, I never was~-I'm not familiar with that at all. I know that the last several years that I owned and operated the Chilchinbito trading post, I worked all Navajo help. I had one girl--I had one Navajo women that practically ran the store, and they're still running for the same fellow I sold it to. And they were
good---I trained them. And as far as their being reliable or honest, I think that they were probably ninety percent,as honest as you would find in any White hoy. Several White fellows worked for me, too, but I wasn't too comfortable about it. But the

 HUNT:
PAGE 35
Indians, if they took anything, it b.e some of your produce,
or your vegetables, or meat, or something l i ke t hat . Ordinarily , they knew what they could have and what they couldn't have anyway without asking. And uh--I found that working with the Indian people--well, I'd say that ninety percent of them, if they know you and understand, and you know them, then you don't have too many prob.lerns. This hasn't been till recent--in recent years where this racial problem has arisen that has caused any trouble at all. Now they have the DNA. That's supposed to take care of the Indians; they go to them for various problems. And I don't say that all White people are too honest with them because I know a lot of them that are in for making what little they can.
I know this charge has b.een made in generalization toward a lot of the traders. I mean, it's just taken for granted that the traders took advantage of the Indians. Now this is out in
the general public, out and away from the reservatio~ area.
And yet, when I came into this area and started talking to various people, it turned out that the trader was much more than just
a business man to these people.

almost a must that they got there to even to save their lives.
And I've done that.. A lot of times we never even got our gasoline money for taking them. There has been a lot of criticism against the Indian trader that he had fleeced them out of their eye
teeth, and this and that and the other, but that's all wrong. For every Indian trader that has made it in Navajo trading, there
have been twenty who go broke.
Is that true?

RH: That's fact. During the Depression, there were a lot of them
that never did make it. And a lot of them never had made too much out of it. There might have been a few that saved his money,
like Kennedy, and some of them¥¥I can think of a lot them that stayed there thirty-five, forty years in the same trading post

Did you ever go on any of the expeditions with John Wetherill

No, no, I never did. But I was in Mexican Hat when he--when he was on his return trip from taking them off down to Rainbow Bridge and across the river to come back through Two Gray Hill Crossing and crossed in there wh.en he had some awful high-powered tourist with him.

wranglers, and Joe Lee was an interpreter for him. And he went

RH: Yes. He went over and told them, and then went back, and then
they went in. KB.: 1fu huh---
RH: You see it was when they went in that all the glory was performed, but Jim Mike had already gone down and come back and told Mr.
W etherill. And Mr. W etherill, he didn't want to be in competition with either one of these other parties, so he allowd the credit
to go wherever they wanted to put it. But actually, and I think it's the truth really, knowing that Jim Mike speaks the truth, and I think that he was the actual founder of Rainbow Bridge.
KB.: Well, I'm glad to hear that.
RH: Cause I really do. I've listened to his story, hours upon hours,
and we brought him up here and had an interview with him just a year ago, and then I went and got this book of the Wetherills,

 HUNT: P AGE
that Mrs. Wetherill wrote so I checked it from this hook. And I'd read it to him, and tell him about this part of it. Yes, he knew, and he'd tell you what men and about some fellows from
Monticello.

KB.: RH:
Yeah, three men, and then he talked about some women, too. It was a little difficult to understand him. He was--
So, I really think that he should have the recognition as
being one of the first anyway, if not the first, that discovered Rainow B.ridge.
Well, mayb.e he is.
Because when they were out hunting horses that morning, why, that's when he went over in. And when he came hack, he told Mr.
Wetherill the bridge is right here. They had gotten off the trail, you know, and he said, "It's right down here." And it wasn't
until the next day that the other party joined them, and then all of them went in, and went in there then with this oáther man,
---?---. But, uh, Jim Mike said, "No, I've seen it before,---?---. I came b.ack and told them where it was and then they took the trail--took the trail and all went in. So, 1--1 don't doubt his story myself. I think he's telling the truth.

 HUNT: P AGE 4 2 KB.: Well, maybe in this way, by getting it recorded on tape--
in the interview I had with him, and will being going into
a lot of various--
RH: He couldn't--uh, he couldn't remember all the happenings, and
about how the two parties met, about where they were camped,
and everything. It was identical to what's in the book. But
if he hadn't been there and seen it, he wouldn't have known until now.
KB.: No, because he can't read, I don't imagine.
RH: No, he can't read or write. And he said that the day before
they rode in, when they were out getting the horses that next morning, he went over that way, following some tracks. That's when he found the bridge and seen it, and come back and told
Mr. Wetherill, "The bridge is just over this way. We're almost to it. It's just ab.out a mile," he said, "down to the--down to it." And there was just a little ridge there that kept you from seeing it, the Rainbow Bridge itself. So he said then, "We all
went back down there together, and---?--- was with them." And he said, "How come he got the credit when I was the first one that went back and told them where it was?"
KBá.: Well, I hope it's corredted--
RH: Well, I do too.
KK: --in later histories. And as I said, maybe this way we can start

RH: I'd sure like to see him--see credit go to where it's due.
KB: Well, I don't want to take up any more of your time, Mr. Hunt.
RH: Well, it's been interesting.
KB: Oh, it certainly has. You don't know how much valuable information
you've provided me with. I had no idea you had been in all these
places when I--when I asked for an interview. It's just been-- RH: I'm not sure.
