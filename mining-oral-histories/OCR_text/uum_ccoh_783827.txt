 T H I S I S AN INTER VIEW OF DR. ELDON DORMAN BY MADGE TOMSIC CONDUCTED FEBRUARY 4, 1994, FOR THE CARBON COUNTY ORAL HISTORY COMMITTEE. [TAPE 1 SIDE 1]
MT: Would you just give us your full name and give us a little history of where you were born and some of your family background.
ED: Madge, my full name is Eldon Dorman, I now live at Price Utah. I was born in Wray, Colorado which is a little town in Eastern Colorado close to the Nebraska border. When I was 5 years of age my family moved to a homestead located 35 miles north and east of Pueblo Colorado. We stayed
there for three years. This homestead idea was really a very poor one because the ground was not situated for farming, but for use of range cattle only. Three years later, after my father proved up on this homestead, we moved to Greely, Colorado. I went to grade school at Greely. I never went to school until I was 9 years of age because there were no schools in the homestead area. And I went to grade school there at Greely Colorado, then I went to high school at Campion Academy which was a Seventh Day Adventist institution at Loveland, Colorado
for four years. Then I went to Lincoln Nebraska Union College for three years of college and at that time I applied for admittance to medical school. I went to Lorna Linda, California and went through four years of medical school there. I had a years internship at Santa Barbara California and ended up in Utah in 1936. I worked for a

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
Dr. Georges at Spanish Fork for about 6 months at that time and then came to Carbon County January 3, 1937.
MT: Now, let me, that's great. Let me just take you back and then bring you forward again. Where did your parents come from originally?
ED: My parents were originally from Illinois and then they moved to Colorado prior to 1890, and settled in the town of Wray Colorado.
What country did you have family come over from?
MT: ED:
Oh, we've never been able to trace that. My grandfather Dorman was a Lieutenant for the North in the Civil War, we can't trace him back except probably he was born in Kentucky. But there are Dorman roots both in France and in Germany. On my mother's side, my grandmother Hammond, which would be my mother's mother, came to this country early on and lived in Pennsylvania for a while. She traces her lineage back to Bradley and those guys who
came over on the Mayflower so there you go.
The king of the country. That's great. Did you have any brothers and sisters?
Yes, I had four brothers, there were no girls in my family. My oldest brother's name was Myron, and the next brother was Laverne, then Earl and then I came along, then my younger brother Claude. We were born approximately five years apart, but no sisters in the
MT:
ED:

 DR. ELDON DORMAN family.
MT: Did they all become professional men?
ED: No, my oldest brother was a pilot in World War I. And,
uh, something happened to him, we don't know what it was, he disappeared. My second oldest brother, was Laverne, he was in the World War I on the Mexican Border in the Cavalry, and then settled in Santa Barbara California where he became a banker. And followed that profession for many years. Eventually retired and spent most of his life, the rest of his life in Arizona with coming to Utah in the summer months. Then the other brother, Earl, was the black sheep of the family, he was always in trouble, and had lots of problems. He ran away from home when he was fifteen years of age, we did not hear anything from him for about four years when he showed up at Greely Colorado. He is now dead. My younger brother Claude is five years younger than I am. Now lives in California. He was a Deputy Sheriff for some twenty years, now retired.
MT: Now I want to bring you forward again, and ask you, what was it that brought you to Utah, and then to Carbon County?
ED: Okay Madge, I was interning at the Santa Barbara General Hospital which was a great hospital, there were twelve interns there. The biggest goal that a person could work for when you were an intern at Santa Barbara was to
3

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
become the surgical resident. We were paid as interns, twenty dollars a month. The surgical residency paid one hundred and fifty dollars a month. So that was a great
step up you see, besides the opportunity of learning. The surgical residency was a two year residency, and I worked my fanny off to get that and I had it all sewed up when a classmate of mine who was interning at the Holy Cross Hospital in Salt Lake City called me on the phone and said look, "I have a patient here in the hospital by the name of Samuel W. Georges who has a heart condition and he is about to die. He is just on his last legs and he has a beautiful practice down in Spanish Fork. Now why don't you come up here and you can take over this practice, you got the practice already there for you, the whole works is set up for you." So I gave up the surgical residency and came to Utah. I worked for Dr. Georges for six months, at the end of six months he was well, he was supposed to have died. He was well and was breathing down my neck, and supervising me in every way. Now he wanted me to continue on working, but I saw we had a clash there. George was from Persia, which is now Iran, see, and a very dominating sort of person. He'd gone to school at Creighton University, was Catholic instead of Muslim, but a very dominating sort of individual, and I saw that we could not get along. So I didn't know what to do, he
4

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
wanted me to stay, but I don't know. So midnight of January 2, 1937, Terry McGowan, who was Superintendent of Blue Blaze Coal Company at Consumers called me on the phone and said, "Look we need a doctor up here and can you be here by noon tomorrow?" So I was up bright and
early the next morning, I came up Spanish Fork Canyon, I was from California you know, and I didn't know how to drive on these slick roads and here was new snow on ice. As I rounded the corner just below old Tucker, a coal truck that I had tried to pass, I was in a hurry to get here you see, I tried to pass this coal truck kind of crowded me off a little bit and I went off the road and into the creek up there, wrecked my car. Now these fellows that put me off the road were coming to Consumers to get a load of coal, so they picked me up, I had to leave my car in the ditch, they picked me up, brought me to Consumers and dumped me out just before dark on January 3, 1937. That's how I entered the coal camps, in
the back end of a coal truck.
cold and I was glad to get it. Now the minute I got to Consumers, that was a hard winter that year. The minute
Did you have to ride in the back all that way?
MT:
ED: Sure, there were three guys in the cab.
MT: Oh my goodness.
ED: But I was glad to get the ride you know, it was kind of
5

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
I got to Consumers, there was snow every place. I reported in to Terry McGowan. I had a bunch of calls waiting for me. They had been without a doctor for a week or ten days and so I saw several sick people and looked at some bulging ear drums, sore throats or a couple of things. But before midnight, I had delivered a baby boy.
first name, and I've kind of lost track of them which I
regret.
MT: What was their last name?
ED: Reaveley. Virginia Reaveley Jordan in Price is related to
them. Now the part that amazed me, down in Spanish Fork, that was a typical Mormon farming community. Many of my fees were collected down there with a box of potatoes or some apples or some other poultry maybe. Before I hardly got the umbilical cord cut and tied up, this man, Reaveley, put a twenty dollar bill in my hand. That was unknown to me, I thought, boy I've carne to the right place. You know, that was great. But from then on I was real busy, this was a, was a hard winter, we had lots of snow. I've got pictures I can show you of the snow that winter in Coal City and that area and right off the bat I needed a nurse. I had a little hospital there, a five bed hospital, plus my office at Consumers.
I'll bet you remember that baby boy.
MT:
ED: Yes, his name was Reaveley. Now I can't tell you his
6

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
MT: Okay, now I wanted to ask you about that, the hospital
and your office were provided by the company?
ED: Yes. They were provided by the medical association. Now the three camps up there, Consumers, Sweets and National
were ahead of their time, in this way they had formed a medical association among the three camps. There was a check off, each man with a family paid a dollar and fifty cents a month for medical care. A single man paid a dollar and that put funds into the medical association which in turn paid my salary. I was paid three hundred dollars a month was my salary. I was given the charge of the hospital, there was a little hospital and my office all adjoined, and I had really pretty good equipment. I had an x-ray machine, a nice laboratory, a microscope. Now the x-ray machine was adequate and boy it was old, the insulation on it wasn't, the wiring wasn't covered properly and if you happened to touch something at the wrong time you knew about it. It wouldn't kill you, but it would scare the hell out of you. And the microscope was adequate, the old brass style microscope, but it was good, it was adequate. And so I had a laboratory which I had to operate everything myself, I had to take the x-
rays, I had to develop them and the whole works.
MT: That's great, did you get a nurse?
ED: Yes. I couldn't hire one locally, so I made contacts with
7

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
my medical school back in California and they located a nurse for me, her name was Margaret Hoskins. Now we had
to pay her one hundred and twenty five dollars a month to get her to come up here to Utah in the coal mining camp. She was getting, she was working in a hospital in Los Angeles and she got eighty five dollars a month as a nurse there. But for this increased salary, she paid her own fare on the train, came up here, we met her in Helper, and she stayed with me all that year. Now later on I had a little bit of problems with nurses. I hired a nurse from Price, she was an R.N.. She was a sister to Dr. McLaughlin in Price and she was a very strict
Catholic nurse. I didn't have her very long because one evening I asked her to set up a tray. I wanted to do a male sterilization operation, and she looked at me and said, "You're going to sterilize this man," and I said "Well yes, he's requested it and he's waiting out there." She said "If that's what you're going to do, good-bye," and she walked out the door and left me with this guys pants down, you know. Then later on there was a Clerico gal, I believe her name was Dolores Clark. Her husband worked in the mine at Consumers, and she took a sort of a mail order course in nursing. She was good. She had a little training out of the other nurses. Now this gal had no training at all you know except what she got through
8

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
the mail order catalog, but she was good and sincere and she used to help me out a lot. All my deliveries were done in the home. If there was a complication, or maybe the pelvic measurements weren't right or there was something wrong with the health of the mother, I would insist that they go to the Price hospital. Otherwise I delivered them all right in the homes.
MT: And that worked out okay, generally? For the mother and the baby, and for you?
ED: These were primitive days, Madge, you know. And that's the way it was done. We had nothing else to do. You know, it was very hard on the doctor's back to lean over and try to deliver a baby in an ordinary bed because the bed was too damn low and you broke your back and you couldn't get in the right position. Sometimes you'd get down on your knees. Now there was a way to overcome that, maybe, that was to take some blocks and block the bed up and make it maybe a foot higher. Also another way to deliver them on the kitchen table, which I did. Then I bought a contraption, it was called a portable obstetrical operating bed. It folded up like a little suitcase and I could open that thing out the patient could lie on this, there was stirrups on this. That was a problem you had where you were trying to deliver it in a bed or on a table, you didn't have any stirrups to get their legs up
9

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
properly. There were stirrups on this, and it worked out pretty good. I got in trouble with that. It was aluminum, and it folded up like a suitcase, and I could carry it around. It was great, I was just real happy with it. I did get in trouble one time, a patient, she went into the
MT:
last stages of labor and became quite agitated and jumpy and jittery and couldn't settle down, and I couldn't keep her in bed so I gave her a sedative. Well this sedative made her wild instead of settling her down. And here I had her strapped down in this contraption with her knees up in the stirrups strapped down, and strapped across her belly and chest to hold her in position, and she got up and walked around the whole damn room carrying the whole contraption (laughing) ... but we got a baby girl. So, this happens you know. Once in a while you give a patient a sedative and it acts the wrong way, and it really set her off.
I've seen that happen, absolutely. How many babies do you
think you delivered up there?
ED: I tried to figure than out, I think about thirty-five
probably, about ten a year. I was there about three years, roughly about ten or twelve a year. I never kept an accurate count of it. Now I did, by the way Madge, I got paid thirty-five dollars for delivery.
MT: Oh, that was above your salary? 10

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
ED: Yes, deliveries were not covered, broken arms on kids
were not covered unless it was an industrial injury, appendectomies were not covered, general surgery was not covered. I got thirty-five dollars for a delivery, I got fifteen dollars for a broken arm on a kid, I got fifteen dollars for taking out tonsils, fifteen bucks for taking out tonsils. An appendectomy, which was of course done, usually at the Price Hospital, was one hundred and twenty-five dollars, and a gallbladder would be one hundred and fifty dollars. So that was about the price
range.
MT: And when you did those surgeries, you would bring them
down to Price?
ED: Except in one instance, we got snowed in up there one
winter. I don't know whether it was the first winter or the second. We got snowed in and we could not get to Price. I had this young man, a young coal miner, who had, I thought appendicitis, and his white count kept going up. See I do these white counts myself. I didn't have a laboratory assistant, I did it myself, and I kept watching him, and his white count kept going up. So, I operated on him, in my office so to speak, in my little hospital up there. Now I had a little bit of a problem because, this is something I wasn't supposed to do, didn't anticipate doing, because ordinarily we'd take
11

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
them to the hospital in Price. And, as I went through all my instruments, I had everything there but what we called a retractor. The retractor was generally a curved instrument, maybe an inch wide, that you could pull the viscera around and get down to the appendix. I didn't have one, but this guy's count kept going up. So I got a hold of Joe Naylor. Joe Naylor was the master mechanic at Consumers, and he had some copper strips up in his shop which was just the right width and just the right
thickness and was bendable so I could bend it. He put those together for me, and made me a couple of these retractors out of copper sheets that he had up there. We sterilized them and I used those for surgery. I was all by myself up there. The nurse gave him the anesthetic, and I had no assistant. I used these homemade retractors and it worked out. That's the only time I had to do that.
MT: But you did keep an anesthetic there.
ED: Anesthetics in those years were ether. The only thing you
had, and God ether was a terrible anesthetic, because it made you sick for weeks afterward. Generally the doctors and nurses inhaled enough anesthesia, ether, to make you crazy for a while. But, yes, the anesthetic was ether, and you poured it. You had a metal mask, which was covered with gauze, and you'd put it over their nose and mouth, and you poured the ether, and made a little tiny
12

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
hole in the lead cap on the ether can and you poured a squirt at a time or a drop at a time. You had to watch their pupils and everything because that was the only
MT:
ED:
indication of the depth of anesthesia. You had to keep the pupils mid-dilated.
That's what I was going to ask you, how did you gauge the amount?
That's the only gauge you had because, besides the relaxation of the patient, you know and stuff like that. You had to keep the pupils mid-dilated. If you got them wide-dilated you were in trouble. If they were too small, they were probably asleep, see. But only in one instance did I have to do an appendectomy, all by myself.
Flying by the seat of your pants, right. But your nurse was there to help?
She poured the anesthetic.
Do you want to take some time right now and tell us more things about your experience as a doctor in a mining camps, and then we'll talk about some other things. Madge, you gave me, a minute ago, this little deal, it's called "Children of the Mines." Now this made me think of a story that I've never told. There was a man in Sweets,
I believe his name was Joseph Williams. He was the father of Bob Williams who worked at Sweets. Joseph Williams was originally from Wales. Many coal miners were from Wales,
MT:
ED: MT:
ED:
13

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
English coal miners. I asked him one time how old he was when he first went in the mines, and he said six years of age. And I said "What in the world did you do in the mine at age six? You weren't able to load much coal." He
laughed and told me this story. I think this may have happened at Winter Quarters, or perhaps even in the old country. I don't know the location of it. Okay, the miners were, in those days and up until twenty or thirty years ago, the desire was to get big lumps of coal, the bigger the better. Now, it's all ground up. If there was a little strip of boney in that coal, now boney as you know Madge is a streak of rock, generally light color, it'd be the black coal and here would be the streak of white, light grey boney down to the middle. The miners were penalized if they didn't clean out the boney themselves. That meant the miner had to pound this large lump of coal up, get the boney out and then load it. Okay, his job was to, before he went into his mine, his father mixed up a bucket of lamp black. Lamp black, they'd get the soot from the stove mix it up with water, get a paint brush, and he would paint over the strips of boney so that they wouldn't be penalized. Wasn't that a
slick way to do it? I'd never heard of that before, and I've never told this story to anyone else. But that was smart. And you know, the miners had things stacked
14

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
against them. Generally the scales were against them, short weight. And then there was this, they could always find fault with this little strip of boney someplace, and they'd be docked so much, or not given credit for the
coal, but this was the smart way, it was a clever idea.
I'd never heard of it otherwise.
MT: Did he tell you any more about working in the mines?
ED: He told me some stories about the early days in the Clear
Creek area. He told me some stories about the Chinese working in the mine up there at Clear Creek. He said that the Chinese people lived right in the mine. They cooked and slept and everything in the mine. I believe it was Clear Creek or maybe Winter Quarters. You see, they were competing with the native people, the other miners, and they got rid of them. You've heard this story Madge, where they put them in the freight car, in the box car, loaded them all in there, locked the car and sent it down. And he told that story to me. He said that the work
that they, you see, all this work was done by hand, by pick. He said that their work in there was meticulous, the roof would be arched perfectly. But they hated the
Chinese, the Chinese worked for less wages, and they were in competition with the other miners. And so the other miners didn't like them and they put them in the boxcar and sent them down the road.
15

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
MT: ED:
MT:
ED:
So that's why they did that.
The Chinese were considered the "yellow peril" you know. The competition was great, particularly wages.
It was the Chinese, of course, who built the railroad across all the mountains.
That's true, and you see, some of those people eventually settled in Utah. I remember many Japanese miners, now we had a "Jap" boarding house at Sweets. We didn't have any Japanese people at Consumers or National, but at Sweets there was a "Jap" boarding house. But these were Japanese and not Chinese, and I think they cleaned the Chinese out a bit too roughly.
Have you heard of any other Chinese coming into the County?
No, no. I think the Chinese miner, to my knowledge, was sort of a rare deal.
They lived right in the coal mines? I hadn't heard that story.
Now that's what this man told me, that they stayed and lived, even did their cooking in the coal mine, prepared their meals. Now, the "Jap" boarding house at Sweets was always a fascinating place for me to go. It was a rather small building, and I remember there were three tiers of bunks, and they were along the walls. There was a Japanese man, most of these Japanese people didn't speak
MT:
ED:
MT:
ED:
16

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
English. There was a Japanese man who was crippled up, the story that I got was that he had been a miner,
injured his back or leg or something, but he walked with difficulty, he could use a cane or crutch. He was always the man that called me when one of the Japanese miners became ill, and he could interpret for me and talk to them. I inquired, you didn't learn much from him about their way of life, except that I saw the rice there that they apparently lived on. He would always give me a bottle of Saki when I came. But, the story that I got was that those bunks never got cold. The minute one man came
on shift, another one crawled into the bunk.
guy seemed to be in charge, was apparently the cook and did interpreting and made the contacts for them. I never saw a woman in there.
Now these men had come directly from Japan?
I don't know, but they didn't speak English. This one man now, he didn't speak English too good either, but he was the interpreter and kind of the boss and handled their affairs, maybe wrote letters for them or stuff like that. This was a dingy, low ceiling little white shack there in Sweets. I can remember the bunks, some of them were two tied up to the wall, some of them were three up the wall.
So did they have Japanese women cooking for them?
MT:
ED: No, these were all men. I never saw a woman there. This
MT: ED:
17

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
It always seemed that someone was in the bunk whenever I was there. See, there were two shifts at the mine, day shift and an evening or night shift, besides that, of course, would be the maintenance crew, which was the other eight hours. So people were coming and going all the time. When one man went into the mine, his buddy climbed into his bunk.
MT: Did the company provide a house for you?
ED: Yes. At Consumers, there were, what they called the
apartment houses. Now, there was one they called the "Big Apartment House." That's where I lived. I think there were six apartments in that house, besides my hospital and office. The hospital and office was on the ground floor of the apartment house and it was almost a basement. It was open on one side with basement on the other so that they had to go downstairs to get into the waiting room of the office. The big apartment house was
for the elite people, Terry McGowan, the mine Superintendent, Joe Naylor the shop foreman, Ray Naylor was the chief clerk. For the elite. Then, across the street were the other apartment house, which were cement block. There was a whole slew of these. They were two story high with garages built underneath. Now, what you see up there today is where the garages were. The garages were made of cement and above that are cement block.
18

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
There was a little porch out on the front and then a stairway went up to an upstairs apartment. My rent for my home was fifty-five dollars a month. I had to pay my own gas. I had to furnish my own car and stuff like that. So
MT:
ED:
MT:
ED:
MT: ED:
I got three hundred dollars a month less the fifty-five I paid for the apartment. Which was a nice apartment, a two-bedroom apartment, then I had to supply my own car. Of course, you were able to collect separately on some of the services, like babies.
Yes. Madge, in those days every kid eventually had his tonsils out. You can remember back to those days?
Yes. I can remember when they were doing them for twenty- five dollars in Helper at the Helper Clinic.
I kind of kept track. I believe I did about a hundred tonsillectomies in the three years I was there. So that was about thirty-five or so a year. I never had a fatality. Everything went smoothly and so I was really fortunate on that.
Your nurse would give the ether?
That's right, and I'd do the tonsillectomy. We'd do a family at a time. I vividly remember, and this family and
I talked about this. There was this Stavar family, Karl Stavar, chief of Police, Frank Stavar who was Deputy Sheriff for a while, and then Veda and then Sylvia. Okay, the Stavar family brings mama and papa. I believe they
19

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
were originally from Walsenburg or Trinidad, that country. They lived in National. They brought the whole
family in one day. There was an argument, nobody wanted to go first. So, the littler kids were picked to go first. I did, I think Veda or Sylvia first. I think, if I'm correct, Frank was the oldest. I could be wrong, but Frank didn't want to go. They were going to do him first. The parents had fixed it, they had decided what order they wanted and were going to do the kids. Frank talked them out of it, he said, "Send somebody else." When we got to Frank after doing the other three, he had taken off in his pajamas and had gone out into the hills and hid out all day. He never showed up back at home until it got too cold that night. He never got his tonsils out. I had him as a patient many years later and he had lots of bouts of tonsillitis. I used to tease him about it.
MT: Did he ever get them out?
ED: No, he never did. He's dead now.
MT:
ED:
I wanted to ask you about the illnesses and the diseases that you treated among the children in those days. What were the main ones?
You know, it used to be a catastrophe because things like measles would go through not one camp, but all camps. We had lots of miners who lived at Cleveland, Elmo, Castle Dale, Price and Helper. Some of these people would go
20

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
home on the weekend. I always dreaded for a family to go home to Elmo or Cleveland because they always brought either the damn measles or the mumps back to camp. They'd bring back the measles and every kid in camp would get
the measles. They'd pick it up in school. The mumps was another treacherous thing.
Did you quarantine them in those days?
MT:
ED: Yes. I was appointed by the State of Utah as the Health
Officer for those three camps. I had these great big quarantine signs. One of them said "Quarantine" with red letters about six inches high. I had a measles sign, a mumps sign and things like that. I'd put up the quarantine sign and then the sign below, whether it be measles or mumps, or small pox, we didn't have any small pox around this area, diphtheria. I was a quarantine officer. I have to tell you a little story. There was a young lady who lived in Sweets, real nice gal in high school, got the mumps, so I put up the quarantine sign. Now, her boyfriend lived over in Consumers. I warned this girl and her parents, "Don't let so and so come over here or he'll get the mumps." Well, one day I went into camp at Sweets, and as I went in the front door, I heard the back door slam. So, I ran around the corner and here was this boyfriend leaving the house. Well, he got the mumps.
I can give you the names, but I better not, both are 21

still alive. Of course, I tease him about this every time I see him.
Did he get the mumps?
Yes, he got the mumps.
Is he sterile? Was he sterile, because sometimes they do go sterile after the mumps?
No. I didn't have that problem. I can remember, not vaguely, but I remember one man who was a big, husky deep voiced person, who got the mumps. He got the mumps and became sterile. He changed to a falsetto, squeaky little voice. He didn't have the bass voice anymore. Then, there was another young man who got the mumps and it made him
MT: ED: MT:

MT: ED:
sterile. He never married because of it. You see, kid's diseases could become a real tragedy to adults too, especially the mumps situations.
I guess in families, if one got them, they were quarantined for months, right?
Generally the father you see, would be older. He could go ahead and work and stuff like that. That was left up to me, you know, how long I keep the family quarantined, until I figure they were no longer contagious.
What kind of immunization did they have in the 1930s? We had whooping cough, diphtheria. We didn't have anything for measles or mumps. They've got both now. We used to give DPT shots each fall. Of course, it was up to
22

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
the parents whether they brought the children in or not. It was real good cooperation there. The public health nurses, even in those days, used to come up. We'd hold immunization clinics. We'd get the word around camp, more or less by word of mouth, and bring all the kids in. We'd give them their shots. Now, these were pre-antibiotic days. We had no penicillin. They were just beginning to get sulfanilamide out. Sulfanilamide was first. Next was
MT: ED:
Sulfathiazole. Now, sulfanilamide caused severe reactions in most people. We didn't get penicillin actually until I left the camps, about 1942, and then all the penicillin went to the armed forces because it was needed there. So, you didn't really have anything to fight infections? No. One of the things that really saved a lot of lives is mentioned in this little article I wrote about Tillie and Marko, was the oxygen tent. I had this little portable oxygen tent, it was a well-made tent with the glass up front and a window on the side. It would fit around the patient. The biggest problem was hauling the oxygen tanks around, those big tanks. I'd have to get some husky miners to help me. That oxygen tent saved a lot of kids. Lots of kids got pneumonia as a complication of measles or a complication of just a cold or flu, you see. That oxygen tent really saved a lot of people's lives, and it was great that we had that.
23

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
MT: And that was actually all you could do for pneumonia? ED: That's right. We used to put mustard plasters on, you
know, and you were considered a lousy doctor if you didn't let the patient put a mustard plaster on. I didn't believe in mustard plasters, but I let the patients use them anyway because they didn't harm that's for sure. They were simple things, you know, things that you had to do. Nursing care was important.
MT: What would you do if, say, they in an injury got an infection?
ED: Okay, luckily I never had one of these myself, but an injury where there would be a fractured leg, a bone's exposed, compound fracture. They would get an osteomyelitis, and that was terrible. You never cleared it. Believe it or not, they used to put maggots in an osteomyelitis to try to clear up the dead flesh.
MT: Is that right?
ED: Haven't you ever heard of that? That is true.
MT: Well, now that you bring it up, I have heard of it.
ED: Yes, that is true.
MT: Did you ever do that?
ED: Well, as an intern I had, but luckily I didn't have an
injury in that time, but there were several cases at the Price Hospital where I had. You see, there's a whole new era opened up since we had the antibiotic. Now, we get
24

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
immune to penicillin, we get immune to this so we've got to go to another antibiotic, and every time you go to a new one the price doubles and triples. You can't afford to get sick. You can't afford the damn antibiotics to take to keep from dying.
MT: That's about where we are today. I know that you've told this story of Tillie in the newspaper. I know you wrote that, but why don't you tell us that story now and some of the other stories of your patients.
ED: You saw the things the stories that were published in the book called Eastern Utah's Industrialized Island?
MT: Yes, well I'm hoping that you will repeat them here so we'll have them on tape.
ED: I'm trying to write some more of these down. I'm running into a little bit of a problem. One story that I tell, that has never been published I recently wrote back in
December. The person involved in it, whom I delivered, is now an adult and has children of her own, did not want me to publish that story.
[TAPE 1 SIDE 2]
ED: The story we were talking about was one problem that I
ran into. Back in December of this year I started writing some more of these stories. I had told these in historical society meetings and stuff but I had never put them down in writing. So I spent the whole month writing
25

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
this one story. It was about a woman who had a problem in that she had been thrown into apparently premature labor because her husband went out and got drunk and they got into a terrible argument. When he came home that night, she went into labor two weeks early and I delivered the baby. Just after I delivered the baby, I had carried the baby; this is a two room house, just a little tiny kitchen and one room for their living. I went into the kitchen was cleaning the baby off, putting it's swaddling
clothes on and its belly band and all that stuff. All of a sudden there was a terrible shaking of the house, there was an exposed brick chimney and some of the bricks came out, the room was filled with dust. A man, step- grandfather of the baby was opening a bottle of whiskey. He was having trouble getting the cork out, and he was standing right by me, mumbling to himself. He was trying to get this bottle of Old Crow opened up. The house absolutely shook and shuddered. What had happened, this was in March, this was a warm day and there was a thaw and an immense boulder about three feet in diameter on a cliff up above, loosened up because of the warm weather, rolled down the hill, came through the house within a foot of the bed where the mother was lying, where I had been standing as I delivered the baby, made a hole just the size of the boulder and took the whole wall out on
26

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
the other side. Everything turned out ok. The mother was still asleep. Here was this hole right beside her bed right where I had been standing when I delivered the baby. The man who had the bottle of whiskey never did share it with us. He put in his pocket and said he was getting the hell out of here before the whole house falls down. I told this story and I wrote it out and I sent it
to the mother involved and the baby involved who now live in Salt Lake . The mother and the father okayed it but t he daughter has become very sanctimonious and she did not want her children to ever know that their grandfather had ever as much had a drink of whiskey so I can't publish this story.
MT: Well you can tell it to me.
ED: It was a fascinating story. All the time you see, the
mother had been trying to get the father to quit drinking the while she was pregnant. That was the deal. He'd been a pretty good boy. He'd sneak off once in a while but he fell off the wagon and carne horne drunk and they got into a hell of an argument and it threw her into premature labor. And this boulder corning through, it could have killed her.
MT: Did he stop drinking then?
ED: No. But what kind of burned me up was the grandfather
took off with the bottle of whiskey and didn't even give 27

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
us a drink when we needed it.
MT: And the mother and baby came through that all right.
ED: Right, and they all live in Salt Lake City.
MT: Now when something like that happened in the camp did the
company take responsibility for relocating these people? ED: I think they repaired the house. Madge, that boulder
stood there for a long time. It was there in 1983, because I went up there. You see the camp was abandoned long before then and that boulder was there, but it's now gone. I went up last fall and some road equipment going over the top into Beaver have removed that boulder. I wanted to get a picture of it. Now I understood that there was a photo some place of this wall that had been
torn out. But I can't locate the photo.
MT: You haven't been able to find that?
ED: You want me to tell about Tillie and Marko a little bit. MT: Yes, and tell some of the stories that were printed in
that new book.
ED: I had to make house calls. And you see the people in
Sweets actually took advantage of me a little bit, because it was more than a mile over to Sweets and it was much more convenient for me to make house-calls over there than it was for them. Many people didn't have cars for them to come over in the winter to my office. But on the other hand, many of these calls were legitimate, and
28

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
I had to see sick kids, kids with measles. I used to carry a little myringotomy knife. I kept this knife real sharp, and a little tiny curve.
Myringotomy knife?
Myringotomy knife, that means opening the ear drum. When you open the ear drum it was called myringotomy.
Can you spell that?
MT: ED:
but I've lost it. It was a little knife that had a little extension on it and on the end here was just a little tiny curved knife about a quarter of an inch in length, which was very sharp. I had to open ear drums because, Madge, remember now we had no antibiotics. If you didn't open the ear drum, then it would rupture and then it would tear it. If I can make a clean little cut and let the pus out, then the ear drum would heal. But I had to open these. Now I had a solution, it had cocaine in it. I put that in the baby's ear and let it set for a minute, then open the ear drum. I had to do that many, many times. But on these house calls at Sweets, I tried to make those about 9 o'clock in the morning. The roads were
terrible, especially in the camps. No four-wheel drive vehicles. I would generally get as far as what they called the "Jap" boarding house. It was kind of a main intersection in Sweets and I'd have to leave my car
MT:
ED: M-Y-R-I-N-G-0-T-0-M-Y. I had that knife for many years,
29

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
there. First of all, when I came into camp, I'd stop at the mine office, and Lloyd Quinn was the superintendent at Sweets, and people would contact him if I were to go make a house call that day. So maybe I would have half a dozen or maybe 6 or 8 or 10 house-calls to make. I would have to park my car and then I would have to walk all the rest of the spots in camp to see these sick kids or other people or women that were ill and couldn't get to my office. Well, this would take me all of an hour to two hours, maybe longer. But as I would finish up, Tillie Yelenich, who lived just up the street just a little ways
from where I would stop my car, would come out on her little porch and give me a motion. And that was good news for me because she always had a bowl of soup or potica. Or maybe a hot roll or something and I could rest a little bit and talk and visit with Tillie. So Tillie was good to me, she kept me alive. Frequently, if it was holiday season she would give me a loaf of potica to take home. I delivered a baby for Tillie, Marko Junior. When he was about six months old, he became very ill, went into a pneumonia. I brought over the oxygen tent, put him on the oxygen, and I had a great fear that he was going to die. He just looked terrible. I'd go over there maybe twice a day to see him. After my office hours, I'd go over there in the morning then I'd go over towards
30

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
evening because I was concerned about him. Now Tillie tells me that I suggested to them that they call a priest. She says that I made the phone call to call the priest because they didn't have a phone. Maybe I did I can't remember that. But anyway Father Dowling and Father Stoffel; Father Stoffel, you know is a monsignor now. They came up from Price and were there and baptized the baby. The baby had never been baptized.
MT: Right.
ED: They baptized the baby Just before I got there one
evening, maybe 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening. The baby just looked terrible. I could tell by the looks on their faces that they didn't think that the baby was going to live. Now Tillie tells me that they told her when they left, now if the baby lives, bring him to church. That's how sick the baby was. I went home that night. I couldn't sleep, I was so concerned about this baby. So about 3 o'clock in the morning, I got up and got dressed and went over there. There was a dim light glowing up there in the cabin, so I went up and tiptoed in. Everybody was asleep. They were so exhausted from being with little Marko, day and night, day after day. I walked over to the oxygen tent and I thought the baby's died and everybody had given up. I put my hand on his shoulder and he'd passed the crisis.
31

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
MT: There was no temperature, huh?
ED: Temperature down, he was breathing. Well you know, after
that Tillie and Marko were devoted to me and grateful. I mentioned this in a story that there were some unorthodox methods of mining in Sweets. I don't know how this happened, but some of the men, and Marko was one of them, would go in the mine on Saturdays and Sundays and work. Instead of going to town and whooping it up or raising hell or stuff like that. They went in the mine to load another ton of coal which brought fifty five cents. But I got this call one Saturday night. It was very late in the evening, and I was dressed up. It was Saturday, maybe I'd been to town or something. I had my suit on, nice white shirt and neck tie. But I got this hurry up call from Grant Charlesworth in Sweets, and he said, "You got to come over right away, we got a problem over here." So I grabbed my medical bag. He said, "You might have to go into the mine." And I grabbed my hard hat and when I got over there Grant was waiting at the portal for me. He had
this damned old electric locomotive about a one to two ton locomotive and he kept hurrying me hollering, "Hurry, hurry, hurry." He laid me down on this locomotive, on the front, he was behind me. The locomotive was just like a flat cable, maybe three and a half or four feet wide and six feet long. I laid down there and I put my hand on my
32

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
medical bag on one side and there was a handhold there,
then I grabbed the rail on the other side. He said, "Now Doc, what ever you do don't raise your head up because there are some low spots in this tunnel and your damn brains will be scattered all over hell if you raise your head up." We went on this damn ride in the mine. Now the tracks in the mine at Sweets were terrible. This locomotive would just rocked back and forth and just shook like hell and I had a hell of a time staying on top of the thing. Grant finally stopped the locomotive. He'd given me a head light, and we ran down the tunnel. I was falling all over the place because of the unevenness of the floor. We got into this working place, and there was three men buried. Now there were two or three men there working on digging them out and they had their heads exposed. That is all I could see. I pitched in with a scoop shovel. I got some rocks and stuff off of them, trying to get them uncovered a little bit so I could give them a shot of morphine. They were all hurt badly. But Marko, when I was putting the shot of morphine in his arm, he looked up at me and said, "Little Mr. Doc, I've
got to have a talk with you. Don't you know any better than to come into a coal mine with a suit and white shirt on?" Now, one of the men was Marko, another was a man we called Bull Dog Mikelous. Bull Dog, because he had a big
33

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
jutting jaw. The other man, I can't remember his name, but we got them dug out. But you see Madge, all the time the damn stuff was falling from the ceiling, it looked like we'd all be buried. But, Marko was hurt pretty badly. He had his achilles tendon severed. Pieces of rock would be just as sharp as a razor blade and this would hit him on his achilles tendon which cut off the achilles tendon, which would interfere with the movement of his foot. I took him to the hospital at Price, sewed the achilles tendon back on, and pretty soon Marko went back
to being Marko and went back to work. Marko was always grateful to me for that. If we would meet some place, if there was anybody else there, he would grab them, bring them over, and say "This is my friend Mr. Doctor Dorman. He saved my foot and maybe my life in the mine and then he saved little Marko's life too." He was sort of my devoted friend.
MT: That's a wonderful story.
ED: The mine closed at Sweets shortly after the war or during
the war, I can't remember which . Marko and T illie operated as a boarding house, they had the old Lincoln Hotel, which was the first on this side to Fossat's Studio. You know, there is a little alley way there.
MT: Oh, down here in town?
ED: Here in Helper. They operated it as sort of a boarding
34

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
house and rooming house primarily for Austrian miners. I visited with them a time or two. In one of the rooms was this immense brass bed. It's in Tillie's home right now. You ought to go up and see it. It was sort of a four poster bed. The posters are about four inches in diameter
and had a little cap on them. Supposedly the story was that at one time a madame who had run a whorehouse here in Helper, she had this bed and she used it to stash her cash and other valuables in it. T illie had the bed in her home now.
She still has that. We need to get a picture of that.
MT:
ED: Yes, we need to get a picture of that bed. But that was
the story behind the bed. Beautiful bed, out of this
world.
MT: I wanted to ask you some more about the medications that
you had. You had your oxygen tent and some sulpha. What
other kinds of medications were you able to give?
ED: Okay, I've told this story before, about the cough medicine. I used to buy a cough medicine called syrup of
wild cherry. It was a real good tasting cough medicine. I used to buy it from old McGonigul in Helper, or from Tom Kelly in Price at the Kelly Drug Company, in ten gallon lots, a gallon at a time. I would buy ten gallons at a time. This was a very popular cough medicine. I'd put it up in two ounce bottles and then I'd put a label
35

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
on it. Set up a wild cherry. People came after it day and night. I had all kinds of customers for this syrup of wild cherry. One day I was over helping Dr. Cummings over at Standardville and I mentioned the popularity of this
syrup of wild cherry, and he said, "Look you stupid guy, don't you realize that people are using this as syrup on their pancakes?" Then you know, a couple days later I had to make an early morning house call and sure enough there were two or three bottles of it on the table and they were pouring it on their pancakes. I got another one. It was syrup of white pine tar, and it tasted just like pine tar. It was terrible. I lost my popularity. Now there was another cough medicine, Madge you might remember it. Elixir of turpentine hydrocodeine, elixir TH and C. They don't make it any more. Now elixir of TH and C was real good cough medicine because it had two ounces of that and almost two grains of codeine in it. You could not at that time put in as much as a grain of codeine per ounce. But they put nine tenths of a grain of codeine per ounce to get under that. Of course, it was the codeine that helped the cough and then it was in an alcohol base so it was about two hundred proof alcohol. If you drank a two ounce bottle of this you had two big slugs of booze plus the addition of codeine, so it surely cured a lot of things besides a cough. I used to have the drunks getting over
36

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
their hangovers come and want a bottle of that and that would help them out and get them ready for next weekend.
MT: What other kinds of medications did you have?
ED: Okay I had five colors of aspirin. You could buy aspirin any color you wanted, in any shape of pill you wanted. You could buy round, square, oblong . Now I found that the
green aspirin seemed to work better than the white, red, or variegated colors. So I would simply change colors on them and give them the same medicines, aspirins. We had no real medication for gonorrhea. We didn't have a lot of V. D. , venereal disease in the camps. I'm certain that the incidents of venereal disease in the coal camps was not as great as in Salt Lake City. But now you can cure your gonorrhea with one shot of penicillin or similar antibiotics. In those days it used to take as long as a year.
MT: What did you give them?
ED: We would irrigate these people with a one to three
thousand solution of potassium permanganite. That was the only treatment and it was used universally. I would get these young Romeoes, they weren't very happy about it. Madge, the thing that always fascinated me about it was that I picked up a fair amount of venereal disease patients from Price and Helper, who would come up there to me because they didn't want to go to their local
37

 DR. ELDON DORMAN doctor, you see.
MT: So that was one disease that you did have to treat quite a bit?
ED: Yes.
MT: But not just that?
ED: Every third day or something like that. But I'd developed
quite a clientele from out of the coal camps because they could come up there since my reputation had gotten around a little bit to keep it quiet. Another thing that I laughed about and I never told this before. I had learned in medical school, and this was new, how to fit women with diaphragms. To keep them from getting pregnant. A lot of Catholic doctors wouldn't do this, but some of them would. I had learned how to fit these diaphragms so I'd have a lot of the younger women in camp come to me to avoid a pregnancy every year and get a diaphragm . W ell, I gave this one gal a diaphragm. I already explained it to her and I also had the nurse explain how to use it. Six months after I'd given her the diaphragm and the whole charge for this diaphragm, the examination, the diaphragm, everything was five bucks. Six months this gal was pregnant. She called me to her home in Sweets to tell me that she was pregnant and she was cussing me out in no uncertain words; I spent that whole damn five dollars and here six months later I'm pregnant and you're to blame.
38

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
Here, I'm in a spot. I'm in her home, and right by her bed where she sleeps, and right where she apparently got pregnant. Up above the bed was a shelf. I said, "Well did you use the diaphragm?" She said I had it on the shelf
all the time. But I got the blame. It is supposed to be
a magic deal. It's supposed to work off the shelf.
MT: That's a wonderful story. I had something in my head I
wanted to ask you.
ED: There's another little story, Madge. I have written a
story about Frank Morgan over at Sweets where he got his throat cut in the beer hall. Frank Morgan was the mine foreman at Sweets. He was a real nice person, had a real nice family. You know Betty Morgan? Betty was his daughter. Ruth lives here, Betty lives in California. He had two daughters and his wife Mrs. Morgan. Now, Frank loved to drink. Oh God, he loved to drink. He was originally from West Virginia, I believe. A real nice person, well educated, lovely family, but he had this bad habit of booze. He'd come out of the mine, go right to the beer parlor, off shift, and get drunk as a Lord, come home go to bed get up in the morning and go to work, and this went on for a while. His wife and daughters, especially Ruth, got concerned about it and said, "Is there something we can do for Dad to make him quit this boozing?" Well, hell, I didn't know. Then, one day, Mrs.
39

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
Morgan said, "Look, if we could just give him something that would make him throw up, he would quit boozing. If he gets sick and throws up, he won't drink for a little while. Isn't there something you can give him that will make him throw up?" Well, I thought of a drug that we had
in those days, I don't know if it's made anymore, it's called APA morphine and it was a fairly toxic drug. You'd give them an injection of that and they would throw up. So, we ganged up on Frank. He had been at the beer parlor, was home intoxicated, sound asleep. They called me so I went over. I said, "Now look, this is going to make him throw up and he'll throw up all over everything." So they fixed up the whole room. We borrowed tubs, we had their tubs, you know number two, three, gallon galvanized tubs. We had dish pans, we had newspapers. They borrowed tubs and dish pans from the neighbors and put them all around and I gave him the shot. He threw up and he threw up, and finally it just exhausted him and he passed out so I left. The next morning, I got over there maybe nine or ten o'clock, and I couldn't wait to get there, you know. Mrs. Morgan met me at the door and she was very upset. She said, "You didn't help a damn bit." I said, "What happened?" She
said, "He awakened this morning, he felt better than he had in years, he couldn't remember throwing up and he's
40

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
in the mine and feels like a million dollars." It didn't help us a bit. We laughed about that. We even told him about it.
MT: Was drinking, well we call it alcoholism today, did you think most of these men were alcoholics?
ED:
There were quite a few people that drank. I would see it to know because the family member would call me or the drunk would fall down and hurt himself. Yes, it was a problem. I had one man fall down in a snow drift on his way home and nearly die of exposure. I remember one fellow who got drunk in Price and was raising hell in a beer joint in Price. I had to see him the next day, which was Sunday morning. He showed up and he had, on his scalp, about a dozen cuts about that long (shows interviewer with hands). They all looked alike, just like a knife. I couldn't figure out how they could be so much alike, about three quarters of an inch long, a clean out, clear down to the bone on his scalp. I sewed him up and said, "What the hell happened?" He said, "Well, they worked me over with a blackjack." You know that was a
code of a blackjack, you could tell when a guy had been worked over with a blackjack because it made those neat little cuts right down to the scalp. I saw several of them later.
I just needed to get some logistics clear in my mind. Now 41
MT:

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
you lived in Consumers, and that's where the hospital was? But you also serviced Sweets and National? How far away were they?
ED: They were close together. Consumers was up ones canyon, kind of to the right. Part way up there was National. You went through National to get to Consumers. Then, Sweets was over in a canyon to the South, which was about a mile away from Consumers. It was quite a distance over to Sweets, over a mile.
MT:
ED:
MT:
ED:
MT:
ED:
How did these people reach you? They didn't have telephones, how were they able to contact you?
They would leave a message, like at Sweets, they would leave the message with the mine office, that would be Lloyd Quinn, and he had a phone and he would call me. So the message in camp got to send a kid or somebody.
Were the house calls included in the medical that the miners paid?
Yes. Everything was included except the extra surgery and the appendectomies, venereal diseases, broken arms and tonsillectomies.
I'm trying to think of some other things to ask you about your practice there. You were there only three years. Yes. I was there three years . Now what happened was this, to the best of my knowledge. Things were going good at Consumers. I can't give you a date on this, I think maybe
42

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
about 1938. One day they were hiring men and I was examining men to go to work. These guys used to fool me, you know. One guy was blind in one eye and he fooled me. Consumers, the Blue Blaze Coal Company, the name of the Company at that time, was owned by wealthy people from the Tintic Company. They had made their money in the gold and silver mines, they were very wealthy. I think their name was Radich. Now what happened was this, they were doing exploratory work. The mine at Consumers went clear
MT:
down under Beaver Creek, maybe three, four or even five miles underground. The company had sent people ahead to drill to see what the coal was like as they went further, and they came in, as I understand it, a split where the coal seam was split by a two or three foot seam of boney, which would make it very expensive to mine. Now, like I
say, you are dealing with very wealthy people. They bought the coal mine as an investment. Something like this would interfere with their routine profitability. So the attorneys, as I understand it, got with the management and said, "Now look, if you close the mine, you could take a million dollar or a four million dollar
tax deduction." So one day, I was hiring men, I was not hiring, I was examining men to go to work. The next day the mine was closed down. Shut down, that was it.
What year was this?
43

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
ED: I think, 1938. I can't give you an exact date on that. My
source has dried up. Armando Salzetti, he had the date written down, but some of the old timers maybe can tell us better. Anyway, one day we were working, the next day the mine was closed down. Now, this brought up some interesting things. Terry McGowan was the Superintendent. He was put in charge of selling off all the mining property, the mining equipment, the tracks in the mine,
the locomotives.
MT: Now, this was only Consumers?
ED: Only Consumers, right.
MT: The other two mines kept going?
ED: Right. They, in turn, hired me for a while. Terry McGowan
was put in charge of disposing of all this material; the houses in camps. Many of those houses were moved into Spring Glen and Carbonville. There was an inventory, of course. Terry McGowan was hired to do this and a fellow by the name of Raymond Johnson was hired also to help Terry out a little bit. Now, Terry used to laugh about that. Terry was a great character. You never could beat a person like Terry McGowan. He had this sense of Irish humor that was absolutely unbelievable. He used to laugh about this, he'd say, "Hey Doc, we discovered that the toilets here in town aren't on the inventory." You've seen the pictures of Consumers taken by Dorthea Lange?
44

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
Dorthea Lange was a do-gooder sent out to the coal camps by Roosevelt Administration to portray the terrible conditions under which the coal miners lived, and she
took all these beautiful pictures that we now have of Consumers. Consumers was the only camp that she took them, except for one in National, and she thought it was Consumers. She discovered, on her photographic safari, that many of these people did not have nice toilets, and I'm talking about an outdoor outhouse, a privy. Well, they didn't have nice ones, so as a result of her photographic trip out there, was that Consumers got all these brand new toilets built by the W.P.A or the C.C.C.'s here in Price. They were beautiful. They were built in a beautiful way, a nice seat inside, a cement floor, and they were put up in Consumers in a straight line. They were the only thing in camp in a straight line. They stood up on the side hill, you know, and the men always referred to them as Roosevelt monuments. Here they were, behind each house on both sides of camp. Terry discovered that these toilets were not on inventory, so he'd sell those for five dollars a piece. Most of those got moved to Spring Glen or Carbonville or some place. He would tell Ray to put the money in the other pocket, and
that was money for booze. Because they were not on inventory, and they cleaned out all the toilets in camp,
45

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
probably forty or fifty.
MT: So, did they close down Consumer camp at that time?
ED: That's right. Now, they let me stay there in my residence. You see, there were a few men staying on like
MT: ED:
MT:
Terry and some of these others. I stayed there for about a year. National and Sweets employed me and Consumers too, but Consumers was closed now. I think I stayed there about a year after they closed. There was a skeleton crew there, you know. People supervising, getting ready to haul machinery and equipment. They started to cut down the tipple. They pulled the rails out of the mine at Consumers. They took some of the steel off the tipple, and that steel went to Japan for twenty dollars a ton to build battle ships to fight us later on. Now, they did not get the tipple torn completely down. Terry McGowan himself, on his own, opened up the mine at the onset of the war because of the demand for coal. He ran a small crew there during the war.
So he opened it back up?
Terry McGowan opened it up on his own. That was during the war, and he operated pretty well during the war, you know, with maybe thirty or forty men working. Now, when Consumers worked real good, they used to have about one hundred and eighty men working.
What did they have at the other two up Sweets?
46

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
ED: Okay, Sweets was about one hundred men and National about
the same.
MT: That's close to five hundred people you were caring for. ED: Now that meant about sixteen hundred people. If you
multiply that by four for a family of four.
MT: There were a couple of things that I wanted to ask you about this period. First of all, your own family. Were
you married when you came here.
ED: Yes. I was married. I married when I was in my last year
of medical school. My wife was a nurse. Now, she helped
me out some too. Then we were later divorced.
MT: But you had your daughter?
ED: My daughter, Marcilla, was born here in Price in 1937 in
February, shortly after I went to Consumers.
MT: We have that picture of her living up there. Another question I wanted to ask you about this period, this was
during the depression? ED: Right.
MT: How were the people working and living at that time? What was your impression of how it was for them?
ED: We were not out of the depression yet. People were poor. Did I ever show you the statements that Milan Corak gave me of what he had collected monthly? He made only about sixty dollars a month after all the expenses were taken off. That was in January, you know, ordinarily a working
47

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
time. That was in 1934. That was before I went there. That was in the real depression years. Yes, the depression affects were still with us. People were poor. Men were willing to work and that's the part that got me.
I had this one guy that left his crutch outside my house and he fooled me. He had a broken leg which was not ready to go back to work yet. He'd fooled me with that. My examination was very superficial, if they were warm I passed them, especially if they had a record of working in the mine. They wanted to go to work and they'd fight to go to work, to get an extra shift. There was no double time in those years, but they'd do it to support their families, maybe to send their kids to school. The stamina and the ability that these people had to work and slave.
It was incredible wasn't it, when you think about it.
MT:
ED: You've seen Gary Prazen's statue "I owe my soul?" All
right, when I was at Consumers, the men would come out in these coal cars, the mantrap, maybe one hundred men at a time. The men would come out of the day shift, say around three or four o'clock in the afternoon and they'd dash down to the bathhouse and they'd dash home. I happened to somehow or another, things were a little quiet, I walked up to the portal of the mine. The entire mantrap had gone home, but here's one fellow sitting out on the powder box just like this (shows interviewer) . I cannot remember his
48

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
name. I called him by name, because I knew it at that time, and I said, "that's the problem, what's the
trouble?" He said, "Hey doc, I'm so God damned tired I can't walk home." You see, the mine was no place for a lazy person because you got paid by what you shoveled. You got paid approximately fifty-five cents per ton. Now, all these men would load thirty tons of coal a day. See, if you load sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt, but sixteen tons brought you about eight dollars. Most of these men would load thirty tons a day so that they would get fifteen dollars. I'm so God damned tired I can't walk it down the hill too.
MT: Did they have a company store?
ED: Yes, we had a company store. We had scrip too. For some
of the extra things where people would pay me, they'd pay me in scrip. Now, I could take that scrip to town and use it at the grocery store to buy groceries, but it was only worth eighty cents on the dollar. That is all they would allow me in the grocery store in town. I would have scrip, you know, people would pay me in scrip, maybe a
debt they owed or something.
MT: Would that be scrip they had been paid?
ED: No, they collect scrip. They could go to the mine office
and get scrip in advance on their salary. Sometimes they had no salary left because they'd use it up as they went
49

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
along. They could go to the mine office. The scrip was worth a dollar at their store but here, the prices were inflated. In those days, there was a little store in National and also at Sweets, but smaller, but really quite a nice store. I've got a picture of it someplace. Consumers management did not force the people to buy
there. It was more or less a convenience for them. Then, another thing would happen. Suppose some cowpunchers came over from Vernal, never worked in the coal mine before, go to get rich, you know, or keep the wolf from the door. As a last resort, a cowpuncher would come to work in the coal mine. I could always tell those cowpunchers because they'd come in to my office in high heeled boots. Many of them had never worked in the mine before. I can remember some from Vernal. Then they would have to go to the store because of the boots, they'd have to get the belt to carry their equipment, hard hat and all. They'd buy their stuff there, besides groceries. They would always have a bunch of punch boards that you could lose your money on. I won a thirty/thirty rifle one time on a punch board, accident you know. But, the company store served a real purpose there. They did not force them to buy there. Now Madge, a lot of people did not have cars so they were more or less obligated to buy at the store. Lots of people did not have cars. They would ride into town with
50

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
somebody, catch a ride with somebody.
MT: There wasn't a train running into Price?
ED: Yes, there was a train that came up for the coal, but not
to operate for passengers like at Hiawatha and Scofield. MT: Did they have amusement halls up there?
ED: Yes, at Consumers they had a building. It was a cement
block building or rock building called, "The Amusement Hall". Now in Consumers it was used to put on movies every Saturday afternoon and in the evening so all the people and kids could go to the movies if they wanted to. It was used for social gatherings and in Consumers they used it as a meeting hall, maybe they would have a dance there. Now, over at Sweets they built an absolutely brand new union hall. You've got a picture of that here. The best union hall in all of Carbon County. That was built there at the time I was up there at Sweets. When I left the area; now remember, Consumers had been closed down for about a year and so Sweets and National were the only ones left and National was half closed down.
MT: Now, I would say that is a tribute to you.
ED: Madge, these are the best people in the world.
MT: Oh my goodness, you're making me cry.
ED: It's making me cry to think about it. How wonderful they
were and what they went through for their families, you know. The man didn't work because he enjoyed it or was
51

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
having fun. He did it to get another dime for his family, maybe a kid to go to school. Now, this has always amazed me. Think of the number of immigrant miners whose
MT:
children became doctors, dentists, lawyers, things like that. The desire of the coal miner was to give their kids more than they had and they could do that by education. How did they ever do that? Was it because of the War when they worked so well? Were they able to send their children away to school then?
ED: This was a tough thing because these kids that went to school had to work too. They did not have scholarships in those days. Look at the Gorishek family. Frank Gorishek from Scofield, two doctors in the family. Three. No, there was Bill Gorishek and Frank Gorishek were doctors and then Caroline who married Joe Meyers and the son, Max Morgan, the doctor, you see. The Ruggeri's, one a doctor, one a lawyer, another one a dentist. Orphanakis, two Greek boys who became doctors. The Demman brothers, two boys became doctors there, Tony and the brother John, I think.
MT: And lots of lawyers.
ED: And lots of lawyers, and successful businessmen. No, you
have to take your hat off to these people. How they did it I will never know. But, like I say, remember we were in depression years and ...
52

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
MT: Did the mines work at all in the summer when you were up
there?
ED: Summer was very quiet.
[TAPE 2 SIDE 1]
MT: February 9, 1994. Madge Tomsic interviewing Dr. Eldon
Dorman. We will continue this morning with our interview. ED: Do you want me to tell you about Crazy Jim?
MT: Yes, let's hear about Crazy Jim.
ED: Do you remember Crazy Jim?
MT: I don't.
ED: Crazy Jim Kartarakis was his name. He lived here in
Helper. He was a Greek man. Some of his family, I think grandchildren, are still around so maybe we have to be a little bit careful. Crazy Jim had a small herd of sheep. They were the most woebegotten, scroungy looking bunch of ewes you ever saw; not very many of them, maybe one hundred. He used to herd those sheep up in the Gordon Creek area. I can remember, in the winter time, I wondered how those sheep ever got through the winter. He herded them in the snow and to me there was no apparent food for them. I can remember driving to town after a
snowstorm one time. Crazy Jim was on his horse, he had his band of sheep, the snow that, we called it new snow, was almost knee deep and he had his daughter, about an eight year old girl, breaking trail for his horse so the
53

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
horse could go easily. This little gal had her feet and legs wrapped in gunny sacks. Like I say, I wondered how these sheep ever made it through the winter because there
just didn't seem to be any food.
MT: How did the little girl live through the winter?
ED: That is right. I can tell you more about her later. When
spring came, he put the sheep up in Consumers Canyon, high up above the mining town where the springs were for the drinking water and culinary water for the town. Of course, they started polluting the springs. Well, Terry McGowan was the superintendent of the Blue Blaze Coal Company and he raised hell and moved him out, but Jim would come back again, so there were a lot of problems. Finally, he moved them out of there and he put them in what we called a mind canyon. Now that was right close to where the portal of the mine was that went in for the coal mine. Terry didn't want the sheep there because of the danger of the locomotives coming out of the mine and the people working there and everything. So, he scolded Jim about that, and Jim would take them out and the next day they'd be back. Jim would take them out and the next day they'd be back. Now, by this time, you see, there were lambs and they were just at the right shape, boy the lambs looked beautiful and this mine canyon and the grass and feed was lush and boy the sheep loved it in there.
54

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
But, Terry would kick him out. Terry finally told him,
MT: ED:
"Now look, I'm not going to be responsible for these sheep. They can't ever come in here again. Don't you ever bring these sheep back in here again." So, he herded them over a ridge down toward National. One morning, apparently, this is what I figured out, he was herding the sheep back over the ridge and then Jim disappeared. Here were the sheep in the mine canyon and Jim couldn't be located. When the mantrap came out of the mine that evening, middle afternoon, around three o'clock, here the sheep were, right by the portal of the mine. About one hundred men jumped out of the mine cars and here were these sheep. Terry nodded his head like this (nods to interviewer) , Joe Bonto said, "Men, grab your pocket knives and do what you're supposed to do." I heard later that fourteen lambs bit the dust. I know that the camp lived high on the lamb chops for a while because I got some too. Many years later I asked Joe Boni about it and he laughed and said, "Yes doc, I think there were about fourteen lambs all right. You know, I think there was a sheep pelt under every rock in camp and the dogs kept digging them up for the next six months."
So what happened to Crazy Jim?
Crazy Jim didn't bring his sheep back anymore, that's for sure.
55

 DR . ELDON DORMAN
MT: Oh, he had just disappeared for that afternoon?
ED:
Yes, right. He got out of there because if they couldn't find him they'd leave the sheep there, you see. Joe Bonto expression I thought was great, there was a Sheep pelt under every rock in camp and the dogs kept digging them up for the next six months .
Do you have any more stories like that?
Maybe I ought to tell you about...
Now, let me get the year straight. This would be when you were still working up there.
Yes. This was probably about 1937. I would guess the
spring of 1937. One Christmas time, it was Christmas day and I got a call that a man was being brought over from Sweets that had been stabbed. So, I went down to the office and opened up my office. Here, two or three Austrian fellows came in and one of them was a guy that we called in Sweets, Big John. You know, all these camps had a Big John. The biggest man in camp was called Big John, and that was his name. I looked up at Big John and he was about six foot six and I had to look up to him like this, and he looked pretty good, he looked a little bit pale. I said, "Who's hurt?" John says, "me." I said, "Well what happened, what's the problem?" They said, i t was Christmas day and three or four of the old Austrian batches had cooked a Christmas dinner and they were all
MT: ED: MT:
ED:
56

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
eating this Christmas dinner a little after noon, but they got in an argument about the old country, about who's town in the old country was the best town and this guy, Sam Kovich got mad and he stabbed Big John. I looked at Big John again and he looked all right. Now, he had on
the most wool shirt, it was right in the days when zippers were brand new and this was a brand new zippered wool shirt. I said, "Where did he get you?" and he said, "Here." So I reached up and I pulled the zipper down. When I did that, clotted blood came out of the inside of that wool shirt. It looked like two or three quarts of it. He had been stabbed in the chest and had his wool shirt on, you see, and then this blood stayed inside his wool shirt. He was not hurt too badly. Now, this fellow that stabbed him, Sam Kovich, is the same man that cut Frank Morgan's throat, and I've got that article in the Carbon County Eastern Utah's Industrialized Island. He also stabbed another man. He seemed to be knife happy. He had a reputation of having come here from Wyoming, having been in a mental institution in Wyoming. He was working at Sweets. He had a great deal of difficulty working with people who worked with him in the mine. They had trouble getting him squared around with somebody he could work with. A friend of mine from Emery County, by the name of Delou Olsen, worked with Sam at one time. This would have
57

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
been about 1936, just a little bit before I went over there, and he complained to the bosses and the officials because he said, "I can't work with Sam, he's crazy, he's going to kill us all in the mine." This went on and they didn't do anything about it and he kept complaining and
complaining again. It ended up that they called him on the carpet in the Union for complaining against a fellow workmen, blackballed him from the Union, and he could never get a job in the coal mine again. Now, this was Sam Kovich, and he was the guy that was so knife happy. After the episode with Frank Morgan, where big Sam had cut his throat and the episode with Big John, there was another fellow, and I believe his name was Yakopich. Then, here again, there was kind of an argument, a drunken brawl or something and a bunch of these Austrian fellows getting together, he was stabbed in the back. I had him in the hospital. He was stabbed in the kidney region and I kept him in the hospital for observation. We had no antibiotics and we had to watch them pretty close. After this Yakopich was stabbed, I complained to the authorities in town. Now, I don't know why this happened, but the mine authorities, superintendents, never would do anything about this, but I complained to the sheriff. I said, "There's a man up there in Sweets, he's stabbed three people and you ought to do something about it."
58

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
Well, they came up looking for him and couldn't find him, but Milan Corak made a special trip and he said, "Doctor Dorman, you better look out, this Sam Kovich has
threatened that he's going to kill you because you turned him in to the authorities." Well, I still had this man Yakopich in the hospital and one morning, just about daylight, my nurse called me, Yakopich had started to bleed. So, I had gone down and I had him sitting up on the edge of the bed looking at his wounds. All of a
sudden, in the hospital door, with a great deal of noise, came this man bouncing in a hundred miles an hour making a lot of noise and shouting something like, "Where's that God damn doctor?" Well, I thought it was Kovich looking for me. It wasn't, it was a man by the name of, I don't know his real name, but they called him Watermelon because his head was shaped just like a watermelon. He looked a lot like Sam Kovich. I had brought my pistol downstairs. I had my pistol in the x-ray darkroom and I grabbed this pistol up and I pointed it right at Sam Kovich, right between his eyes and I almost pulled the trigger until I realized I had the wrong man. I pointed it at Watermelon, not Sam Kovich. Later on, Sam Kovich was hauled into court in Price. Old Judge Hammond was the judge. The courthouse was upstairs at the time, in the old Silvagni building. Judge Hammond sent him to the
59

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
penitentiary for three years. As he left the room that day, he pointed his finger at me and said, "I shoot you,
I kill you when I get out." Now, it so happened I was a little leery see. I went back to school and I didn't know what would happen when I would come back here. He got out of the "penn" a little early and he went to Wyoming and was killed in a brawl up there, so I was taken off the hook. Here was one man who was apparently deranged and off his rocker, and he stabbed three people that I knew of.
MT: So, what did Watermelon want that day that he came storming in?
ED: Oh, he'd hurt his hand. He'd had injury and he'd hurt his hand so he was looking for me and I almost shot him.
MT: Who else did this Kovich shoot? Who did you say he shot? ED: He didn't shoot anybody. He always stabbed them with a
knife.
MT: He stabbed a sheriff?
ED: No. Frank Morgan, the mine foreman, was playing cards in
the pool hall at Sweets one Saturday night. He was pretty well intoxicated. He loved to play poker and he loved to drink. You know, the beer hall at Sweets really cooked on Saturday night. It was filled with people. They were yelling, shouting and screaming, and drinking. You name it and they did it. This man Kovich came up to Frank and
60

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
kept tapping him on the shoulder and wanted him to dance with him. Well, men were dancing with men because the only woman in the place was old "Mexican Mary," and everybody couldn't dance with her. So, Frank said no that he didn't want to dance and Sam kept after him. Finally,
Frank Morgan said, "Now get the hell out of here and leave me alone. I don't want to dance with you God damned bohunk," or something like that. Well, this guy disappeared for a few minutes and he carne back and he stood behind Frank Morgan's chair. He took out his knife and slit Frank Morgan's throat from ear to ear and then they called me. Well hell, when I got over there, I didn't know what had gone on. Everybody was drunk and carrying on and couldn't have cared less whether somebody was going to die or not. They pointed to Frank Morgan and Morgan was sitting there in the chair with his chin down like this (puts chin toward chest) . I raised his chin up and his throat was cut from ear to ear but luckily the knife was dull enough, it just went through the skin. It had exposed all the jugular veins and everything there, see, but it hadn't gone deep enough to do any damage. This was Saturday night and I had already sewed up two or three people back at the office. I thought, "Oh hell, if I have to get this guy in my car and take him over there, he's going to bleed all over everything and I'll have a
61

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
hell of a mess to clean up." I had the necessary stuff in my bag so I laid him down on the pool table and sewed up his throat. Everybody was giving me advice, "Now Doc, that stitch isn't quite right," "You know, you've got to do this," and "You'd make him look a little better if you'd do that." Then his son-in-law, Clede Andreini, was
there and he took Frank home. After I got him sewed up, I kind of got the story that when Sam was trying to slit Morgan's throat, two or three fellows tried to stop him. One of them was Osbey Martin. Osbey Martin grabbed his knife in his hand and got his hand cut. The other fellows had hit him over the head with full bottles of beer and they claimed they had broken something like eleven
bottles of beer over his head and never knocked him out. The foam was still on the ceiling. Now, the way they had this set up at the beer parlor, there was this bar and they would put the warm bottles of beer on the one end of the counter and then there was a big tank or galvanized tub filled with ice they'd put the cold beer in. When they'd take a cold one out, they'd get a warm one, you see, and put it back in the galvanized tub. These guys had grabbed the hot bottles of beer and hit Sam Kovich over the head and never knocked him out. Finally, the one guy said, "I think you better go see Sam." I knew where he lived, he lived in the bunkhouse at the upper end of
62

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
camp. I went up there. He had undressed. He had apparently bled a lot. He was squatted in a number three galvanized tub taking a bath, and he had an old dirty washcloth up on top of his head. So I spent the next two or three hours digging glass out of his head. I said to him, "Sam, how do you feel?" He said, "Well, I feel pretty good, but I do got a little bit of headache." So
then I got back to Consumers. It was just getting dawn. Next-door was the boarding house and they always lived it up on Saturday night. I can still remember getting out of my car and going into my apartment and I could hear those raucous voices over at the boarding house. I mean there wasn't a tune in the whole bunch and they were singing
"It's only a shanty in an old shanty town." Did you get called again that night?
MT:
ED: No, not that night.
MT: This sort of thing was quite common?
ED: Well, no. I didn't dare leave town on weekends. This was
a thing that kind of bothered me. I had to go to the hospital in Price, but I couldn't go any place where I couldn't be reached by phone day or night, during the week because the mine was working and there were men in danger and on weekends because there were fights and brawls, you see. There were times I never got out of town for two or three months at a time because of that
63

 DR. ELDON DORMAN situation.
MT: And then if you were able to leave town, did you have someone to replace you or take over for you?
ED: No. So, I couldn't leave town, really. One time in the spring, on a Sunday, I decided I'd go for a little drive. I had been confined to camp and the hospital in Price and on the road back and forth; I decided to go for a little drive. When I got back, there was a man there that was just madder than hell and he just chewed me out, "Where the hell have you been? My boy has swallowed a twenty-two shell. You didn't have any business leaving the coal camp because my kid swallowed a twenty-two shell and you should have been here to take care of him." Well, I didn't do anything anyway. I gave him a bunch of bread and potatoes to eat and he passed it all right. But, this man was very angry with me because I was not available. Well, it was a little hard. Now those were during the rush winter months when the mine was busy and everybody was working, lots of activity going on.
MT: How about during the summer? Were you able to get away then?
ED: Yes. The summers varied a little bit, but most summers the mine was very quiet. Sometimes it worked maybe one day a week, sometimes two days a week, maybe none at all. The only men who would be in the mine would be the pump
64

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
men, the men who were running the pumps and things like
MT: ED:
that; so the summer was different than the winter.
How about the Saturday nights in the summer?
Well, they weren't as bad that's for sure, because people most of the time weren't working and they didn't have money to buy booze.
MT: All right. Now you stayed for three years in the camps. What made you decide, am I moving too fast? You were going to tell us about Dave, and then we'll go from
there.
ED: Oh yes. Now this is pretty well written up in one of
Helen Papanikolas' articles about the strike of 1933 in that area. Now it seems that Sweets mine was pretty well organized among the men, probably not recognized by the management; not the United Mine Workers, but the National Mine Workers. As you remember, there was some little squabble about the National Mine Workers being communist oriented. Anyway, there was some kind of barricade; I don't understand this completely, Helen Papanikolas had it done pretty well; so, they had some kind of barricade put up and Dave Parmley, who was the superintendent at Consumers, came along and went through the barricade, or tried to get through the barricade. He had a pistol on him. Helen Papanikolas tells the story of how these big Austrian women took Dave Parmley down, took his gun away
65

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
from him, and then peed on him to show their indignity and contempt for him. Now, I found out later that Milan Corak's mother was the woman who took his gun. This gun, Milan Corak still has in his family. Milan Corak's mother took the gun away from Dave Parmley and Milan Corak still has the gun. Somehow or another, I never learned this when I was up there. Milan Corak told me this two or
MT: ED:
MT: ED:
three years ago.
Do you know who any of the other women were?
No. Now Helen Papanikolas mentions one woman. I think her name was Mailka, M-A-I-L-K-A, was involved in this.
I heard my mother-in-law talk about her.
Now you see, what this did for Dave Parmley, it ruined his reputation as a boss. He couldn't give an order to anybody, "You go do this," the guy would laugh at him. Here, he had been taken down, humiliated by these Austrian women who had actually peed on him. So, he lost his job at Consumers as mine superintendent and they
imported Terry McGowan to take over because that ruined Dave Parmley's reputation as a boss and leader. The indignity of these Austrian women doing that to him, he
was the laughing stock of everybody.
Wasn't Dave Parmley in a number of the mines before that? There was a Dave Parmley before him that was involved in the, I think his father, was at Winter Quarters and was,
MT: ED:
66

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
I believe, a State Mine Inspector. The Parmley family had been coal mining people, you know, Castle Gate, Winter Quarters for years.
MT: So was he literally driven out of the camp?
ED: Well, he just lost his job. This pistol was not a big pistol; I haven't seen it, but Milan described it to me and I know exactly what it was. Apparently Dave Parmley had it in his shirt pocket. It was a little colt, nickel plated, I think, with pearl handles on the butt, a
MT:
ED:
MT: ED:
MT: ED:
twenty-five caliber colt, a tiny little pistol. Mrs. Corak, and I believe her name was Eva, reached in his pocket, took it away from him, then helped the other gals take him down and pee on him.
I find this interesting. You're saying you had a gun, he carried a gun, why did you carry guns? What was your thinking in those days?
I carried a gun frequently after this Sam Kovich thing came about.
Was that when you bought a gun? No.Ihadagun.Afterthatcameup,yesIhadagunor a gun was in the car. I was apprehensive about this man. Guns were a frequent thing. Do you want me to tell you about Osbey Martin?
Yes.
Osbey Martin was quite a guy, he's dead now. He was a
67

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
bachelor, a big man, very burly and husky looking. He came into Sweets. The story was that he had served time
in the penitentiary in Colorado for having killed a man in Colorado. Osbey's biggest point of bragging as far as he was concerned, was that he was an expert marksman, that he had worked, at one time for the Winchester Repeating Arms Company demonstrating what a good shot he was, and he always used Winchester guns. I watched Osbey do this. He had a Winchester, model 94 carbine, thirty/thirty and he would take ordinary marbles and throw them in the air and he'd hit three out of four of them, you know, little bitty things. So he was a real expert marksman. Whenever there was a little argument or anything came up, Osbey would say, "Now you guys behave yourselves or I' 11 go get my tirty /tirty ." Instead of saying thirty/thirty, he'd say tirty/tirty. Well, Osbey drove a horse in the mine. Now, in those days Sweets had electric motors as collection motors, but the individual rooms or working places in the mine, the coal was picked up by men who drove these horses. They had quite a number of horses at Sweets and Osbey was one of the drivers. Now
it seems that Osbey had a little bit of a racket going on. You see, if you were in a spot mining coal and you couldn' t get a coal car, you couldn' t mine any coal . Well, if this man, whoever he was, working in this spot,
68

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
didn't let Osbey put his check on the coal car every once in a while, so Osbey could get paid for coal, which was
theoretically illegal, Osbey wouldn't take him any coal cars. So Osbey had these men in a spot ... if they didn't pay him every so often, he wouldn't take them any coal cars and they couldn't make any money mining coal. Well, there was a fellow up there by the name of Erwin Brinley, and he raised a hell of a fuss about this. There were a lot of men upset because Osbey got greedy. They didn't mind, once in a while, paying him a little bit to get a car but when this got too excessive and he got too greedy, they didn't like it.
MT: Was he also paid by the company?
ED: Sure, he was paid on a wage.
MT: I see, and then he was getting the money they were paying
him.
ED: Every man in the mine had a check. It was a round deal
that had his number on it with a little hole at the top where it could be hung on the coal car. To get these coal cars, the men would let Osbey put his check on them and then he would get credit for that load of coal, which was money in his pocket. Now the management shouldn't have permitted this, but it went on. Anyway, there was a hell of a ruckus raised about this and they called a special Union meeting. Now, I have a picture, you have it here,
69

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
of the Union Hall in Sweets. To get to the Union Hall, it was a brand new beautiful building, you had to go across a little foot bridge. It was just about three or four feet wide, it had a railing on it and it was about eight or ten feet high. Now that little foot bridge went over
the little creek or stream that ran down through Sweets. Now that stream, talk about primordial mud, that was it. It was filled with orange peels, the contents of "pee
pots", dish pans, you can't imagine what that creek had in it. It was such a contaminated deal. But anyway, they'd had this meeting in the Union Hall. It didn't get settled in there and they got into an argument as some of the men coming back from the Union Hall, right on this bridge. There was a heck of an argument going on and Osbey was standing about in the middle of the bridge and this little guy, about five foot four, weighing about one hundred and thirty pounds, by the name of Erwin Brinley, hauled off and hit Osbey on the point of the chin. Osbey staggered against the railing, fell off the bridge, into the slime and dirty dishwater below. Hell, they didn't call the sheriff, they called me. I got a phone call over in Consumers, "Hurry up, come over to Sweets, Osbey's on a rampage. The whole town is going to be shot up." So I hopped in my car. It was getting toward evening that day. When I hit the border of Sweets, here's a man standing
70

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
with a shotgun. I go a little farther and here's a guy with a rifle. They'd go like this to motion me where to go on up. I come around the corner and here's a couple more guys with an automatic pistol and a shotgun and a
rifle up above saying, "Go on up to Osbey's." I knew where Osbey lived so I went up and he lived like Sam Kovich, in one of the lousy cabins that they'd had for the men. I knocked on Osbey's door and didn't get a reply
so I knocked again. Osbey said, "Who is it?" I said, "It's the Doc." He opened the door, and when he opened the door, he put his thirty/thirty down and I went in. He had an injured rib and he was scratched up and he was
bleeding a little bit from his arms and stuff. So I said, "Osbey, you better come over and we'd better take some x- rays and check you over good." All the time he was saying, "I'm going to get those guys, I'm going to get those guys, I'm going to get them." So I got him in the car, but he'd brought his gun with him. He sat in the front seat and had his gun between his legs. I took him over to the office at Consumers, looked at him and patched him up a little bit. When we went to leave, I slipped him a couple of sleeping pills for pain, but he took his gun with him. I dumped him off at Sweets but I kept his gun in the car. After he sobered up ...but talk about an armed camp. When I drove him back to camp, I saw
71

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
at least six or eight people with guns, pistols, automatic weapons. They were all ready for defense, you bet. Now Osbey, he was really a character. I don't know whether I'll tell you about this or not. Well, maybe I will. Sweets was a kind of a haven for old worn out prostitutes from Rock Springs. These gals in Rock Springs would maybe get in trouble or get sick or something and
they would come down to Sweets, and there were some Austrian people there where they stayed for R and R you know. Well, some of them wanted to make a dollar or two while they were in Sweets, so Osbey got tied up with one of these gals one time. I knew this was going on. Osbey showed up one time in my office, with this prostitute in tow and I got the story. Now this is probably the reason she was on Rand R from Rock Springs; she had a situation known as vaginismus. When Osbey tried to have intercourse with her, her vagina clamped down on him and he couldn't get away. You've heard of such a thing, have you?
MT: Yes.
ED: Anyway, Obsey said, "God Doc, it was kind of fun for a
while." That wore off so he brought her over to see if there was anything I could do and I said, "No, there's nothing I can do, give her a little more rest." I've never told this story before, but to me that was kind of a funny situation when old Osbey said, "God Doc, it was
72

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
kind of fun for a while, but when I couldn't get away I began to get apprehensive." It took them about an hour to get separated, he said.
The gamete of medical problems that you had to deal with
MT:
ED:
MT:
ED:
MT:
ED:
in that camp, it's really incredible.
It was life in the raw, you know, but it was fascinating, it was interesting and it was wonderful.
Okay now we are going to talk about your leaving and, do you want to take a break right now?
Yes, I would like to. Now, I don't know whether I should have told that story or not.
All of this is part of what's gone on in this county and we need to know it don't you think?
I told you the other day that I used to get a certain amount of business of venereal diseases from Helper and Price because the young fellows who got this would come up to me rather than going to a doctor that they knew in town. I used to get an occasional prostitute that would come up from Price or Helper to get their blood tests. Now, in those days, each prostitute used to have to have, above their bed, one of these tests from the Health Department. Those came back in slips, they were an orange color. I've got one or two of these things. They were a little sheet of paper about this wide, and about so long, and the Utah State Department of Health for a Wassermann
73

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
test. They had to have a new one of those each month, as I remember. They would stick this on the wall above their bed in their place of business. I used to get an occasional one that would come up from Price; she had probably failed in Price, she'd gotten a positive test and she didn't want to go back to the same doctor again because he would say, "No, we got a positive test," hoping that this new test would come back negative. Now
these were tests only for syphilis, they were only Wassermann tests and it didn't indicate whether they had gonorrhea or not. These were on a very distinctive orange colored sheet of paper and they were about six inches squared that they would stick up on their wall certifying that they were free from syphilis, but it didn't say anything about gonorrhea, which was a real problem too. I want to tell you about a young fellow that come into the office one day. He had, on the end of his penis, the most beautiful chancre you ever saw. It was just about the size of the end of my thumb. I immediately recognized this and, you see, I'd gone to medical school in California where we saw a lot of this. So, I told him what it was and he said, "No, I got this ... I went horseback riding and I rubbed against the saddle and that damned old saddle was just rougher than hell, and I went for a long horseback ride and I got this scab (as he
74

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
called it), from the saddle from this horseback ride." So I kind of opened my mouth and I said, "Well that's a hell of a place to take a woman, on horseback, to get this thing." Of course, that upset him. This particular man,
I remember him. You see, we had no penicillin for the treatment of syphilis or gonorrhea, and I treated him with a drug called 6-0-6. It was about all we had. It was an intravenous medication that you had to give them, and then there was a newer one called mapharsen, M-A-P-H-A-R- S-E-N, mapharsen, that I treated him with.
that made many people very, very sick. They were the only treatment we had and they were not really too successful. Now this man, I treated him probably for two years or more. His Wassermann finally became 2+ instead of 4+. He married, had a family, but later on he became virtually blind as a result of the syphilis. He showed up, later, in my office because he couldn't pass the eye test to go to work in one of the coal mines because of his poor vision as a result of the syphilis. I couldn't pass him either. So, he went back to the mine and said, "Yes, he had seen Dr. Dorman," which he had, but I had told him I can't pass him. He got a job in the mine and he worked for many years. They didn't ask him for any certificate
What kind of medications were these?
MT:
ED: Real strong arsenicals. They were real powerful drugs
75

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
from me or anything, he just said, "Yes, I saw Dr. Dorman," which he did, he just didn't tell them the bad news that I had given him. He worked successfully in the mine, virtually blind and made a living for his family. I always kind of laughed about this in my mind because he blamed the situation on an old beat up saddle that he had to ride on when he rode horseback, and I teased him about telling him it was a hell of a place to take a woman. Well, I'm a little bit curious, too, about his family . He had children, didn't his wife catch it?
No. He was treated enough that he was not contagious. He had children and everything worked out nicely.
But he did allow you to treat him after? He was convinced
MT:
ED:
MT:
ED: MT: ED:
MT: ED:
it wasn't the horse?
Yes, that's right.
Are you ready to move on and talk about why you left? Well, I think we went over that a little bit the other day. I told you that Consumers closed down.
Exactly.
The mine closed down. That made it difficult for the other two mines to support a doctor to live up there. Consumers was the larger of the three camps, so it supplied the lion's share of the money for a doctor and a hospital. When I left, Dr. Frank Colombo took over for me up there, but he did not stay up there and live up
76

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
there. He came up only two days a week. Now this was the best they could do, you see. He had the Columbia and Sunnyside area at that time, where he lived. Later on it went into Dragerton, you know, and he had the hospital up there, but Columbo would come up only two days a week. I left and I went back to the University of Pennsylvania and went to school.
ED:
[TAPE 2 SIDE 2]
I went to the University of Pennsylvania one year I took,
at that time, eye, ears, nose and throat. Those several specialties were kind of combined into one early on. Then, I had a year's residency in Washington, D.C.. Then I came back and, as I told you, I went to California first and I had to flip the coin twice to come back to Utah and practice here. I did eyes, ears, nose and throat, the combined specialties. Then, in about 1952, or 1952 it was, I went back and I took another full year at the University of Pennsylvania just in eye, and then I limited my work to eye. Now, when I came back to Utah, I didn't know for sure that I was going to practice here in Price. I liked Utah, but I ran into quite a little opposition in Price because in those days, taking out tonsils was a big source of income for general practitioners. Everybody in this community, this whole area, was a general practitioner, there was not a
77

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
specialist in the whole area. Well, you see, since I had training in ear, nose and throat, I cut into these family doctors' practice because people would come to me to get their tonsils out or their kids tonsils out. After a while, this competition, or feeling of resentment kind of wore down because I could frequently get them out of trouble. I have to say this, many of the general practitioners were not very good at taking out tonsils and there was lots of bleeding and complications afterward. In my training I had, I could take care of it. So after a while I was sort of welcome, being on hand if you please, to take care of their mistakes. It worked out
real well. As I've told you before, I think Carbon County is the best place in the world to live. The people here are different people, they are more cosmopolitan, you know, they are a mixture of all the immigrants that have come to see us. I love Carbon County. So I've practiced on Main Street in Price for fifty years.
MT: Anything you want to say about your experience there? Is there anything else?
ED: Well, I had a little problem, it was kind of funny in a way. One night, it was a Saturday night I believe, about midnight I got a call from the Madame at the New Grande Hotel in Price. She said, "Dr. Dorman, I hate to bother you, but one of my girls here has a very severe sinus
78

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
infection and she's just suffering so much she can't stand it. She's got to get some relief so would you come down and look at her?" Well, it's the middle of the night, so I parked my car right in the front of the New Grande Hotel in Price, went upstairs and was greeted very nicely, saw my patient and went out and got into my car and drove home. Everybody in town had seen my car parked
in front of the New Grande Hotel, so my reputation was... Dr. Whiting used to have a little joke, you know, he'd have to see these people too, and one remark he would make, "You know how to make a hormone?" His answer was, "Don't pay her." I got in trouble when I parked my car in front of the hotel. You know, it used to be kind of fun to drive down by the Post Office and park and see these guys trying to sneak into the New Grande unobtrusively, where nobody could see them. Don't park your car in front of the New Grande.
MT: How did they do this? It was right there on Main Street, wasn't it?
ED: No, it was where the parking lot is for the Carbon-Emery Bank now. It was due east of the Post Office, where that vacant lot is, behind the Post Office, East of the Post Office, was where the New Grande was. Across the street was the old frame building that I believe is still standing there, it was called the Star Hotel. That was a
79

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
house of ill repute. These places were all over town. I think Helper probably had more houses of ill repute than
Price.
MT: Do you remember what year it was that they really closed
down the houses of prostitution?
ED: I think it had to be pretty close to 1950 because I
remember, in about 1945 or 1946, I got involved with John Moyle and "Buck," George Young, in a store called 'The Buck Sporting Goods.' That was on East Main Street. We built the building there, it adjoined Dominic Besso's Shoe Shop on the east. It's where that carpet shop is now. We sold a lot of records, phonograph records. We had a sporting goods store and we sold guns and ammunition, sporting goods and camping outfits; but we spread out and sold radios, we didn't have T.V.'s in those days, but we used to sell hundreds of records, phonograph records, you know, the little flat platters. One of our best customers was the Madame down at the New Grande Hotel, her name was Boots, B-0-0-T-S, and she used to buy more long-haired music records from us than anybody else. That was in the late 1940's, so it was after that. I think it was about the time that Bracklee went out and A.D. Keller came in
as Mayor.
MT: I think they persisted, they were here in Helper longer
because I remember running into them in the grocery
80

 DR. ELDON DORMAN store.
ED: The building right up the street, you know, was one of the last houses of ill repute.
MT: I think the refrigerator we have here in the Museum, in the kitchen, that and the electric stove, came from one of those houses.
ED: There were one or two that persisted in Helper, what was called the Carbon Hotel, I think the next two-story brick building down the street.
MT: They would always come into the grocery store.
ED: In Price, I used to see a lot of these girls for eye examinations. Frequently their pimp; generally there was a pimp involved, a man involved who kind of shepherded these girls around and took them out and kept his eye on them while they were shopping and buying clothes and
stuff like that. He used to bring these girls into my office, he'd bring three or four of them. That was from, he was from the Central Hotel in Price, which is upstairs now, above the Hi-Spot, Farlaino's Restaurant. The upstairs there was a house of ill repute. He used to bring these three or four gals in and he'd get their eyes examined, but he was always keeping his eye on them, you know. He used to bring them to Belva's dress shop, which was close to me there. These prostitutes dressed pretty well, so they were a good source of income for Belva and
81

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
her dress shop .
MT : I wanted to ask you when you got i nvolved in archaeology and in the Museum. Do you want to go into that now?
ED: Yes. There was a geology teacher at the College; I'll tell you his name, his name was Vernon Merr i ll . Do you remember Vernon Merrill?
MT: That name sounds familiar. Did he teach at the High School?
ED: He taught at High School. You know, the High School and College were combined for a while. He taught there. Well, one of his subjects was geology. For some reason his geology classes deteriorated. I used to say it was because Vernon Merrill got so fossilized that he didn't teach an interesting class. So in no time at all, his geology classes had deteriorated down to where he didn't have any students . I think, in 1959, the College imported Don Burge to teach geology. Now, Don Burge was a young man, new to the community. I belonged, at that time to the Carbon Jeep Patrol. This was about a dozen fellows in Price who all had jeeps, but most of them were rock hounds too. One of them, I think probably Art Rasmussen or Hollie Bryner came to me and said, "Now look, if we can get twelve students, Don Burge, who is the new teacher at the College, will teach us a geology class." Well, we got about twelve people together . The f i rst
82

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
course that Don taught us was General Geology, then he went into more complicated subjects. Finally, he taught a class on the Geology of Utah. Don was young and enthusiastic. After we'd go to class, we went to class for two to three hours in the evening, we'd go downtown
some place and have a cup of coffee and sit around and gab again. At these coffee seances, Don would say, "You know, we're crazy. You guys are crazy. We ought to start a geology museum here in Price. Southeastern Utah is a paradise for geology and all these artifacts and geological findings, dinosaur bones and all this stuff is prevalent here. The reason that Carbon County is so wonderful for the geology is because of all these canyons and everything is exposed, you can see all of the strata, you can see the different geological formations, they're open like a book." Well, he kept talking about it. Like I say, there were about a dozen of us, some of those people were: Holly Bryner, Art Rasmussen, Mack Budge, Kent Olsen, myself, Bill Reeves and two or three others. Finally we decided that we would start a geology museum, so we began collecting stuff. A lot of these guys, being rock hounds, had quite a collection, you know, geodes and trilobites and all that sort of thing. We had trouble in getting a room to display our stuff. Finally Price City decided to let us have a little room upstairs. It would
83

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
have been in the South-West corner, upstairs, in the City Hall in Price. Well, we didn't have any cases, so as I
told you this morning, we got word that we could get the cases from the old store in Castle Gate. We took a truck, a big flatbed truck, Art Rasmussen at Price Commission loaned us a truck and we took five or six guys up there. We located and got these cases out of the old store, boy they were covered with dirt and everything. We took them upstairs. They were filthy. They had about fourteen or fifteen coats of varnish and linseed oil and turpentine all over them. We tried to clean them up, scrape them, put paint remover on them, then decided we couldn't do it, so we painted over all this. We spent several months getting this exhibit together. We'd been working there maybe several months and one fellow finally said, "Look, what about this archaeological stuff that is around here? People have a lot of collections of artifacts, manos, arrowheads, all this stuff, baskets, pots. Shouldn't we maybe try for an archaeological exhibit to combine with our geology?" Well, that was a good idea. We let the word get out, we got an article in the paper. Boy, we got a
cold shoulder, nobody wanted to part with any of this stuff. That was their prized possession and that was it. Dr. Whiting and I contacted Fred Keller, Judge Keller had lived, as you know, in Monticello, San Juan County, and
84

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
had a beautiful collection of Anasazi pots. Here again, Fred said, "No, I don't think so. I've been collecting
those for about thirty years. Well no, let me think about it." I go to him again. One day, in the midst of my office, I got a phone call. It was Fred, he said, "Doc, do you still want those damned pots I've got?" I said, "Yes Fred, I sure do," and he said, "Well you can have them." I said, "Fred, what changed your mind?" He said, "Well, I had the pots downstairs, in the basement, and the cleaning woman knocked over one and broke it. You guys can take better care of these pots than I can. The minute we got Fred Keller's stuff and got the publicity on it, everybody else wanted to bring their stuff in. Well, one of our main contributors was Dave Hordeil, who had a big ranch out at Nine Mile Canyon. Dave had a lot of stuff, so we got Dave's stuff. We got Keith Hansen's stuff, plus Keller's, that started us out. We had a problem when it came to...we wanted to get a dinosaur. We had a problem on whether we really wanted to go on with this Museum. Should we really pursue this? So one day we set up a date with Dr. William Lee Stokes, who was a local person born in the Cleveland area, his folks were from this part of the country, who had been active in the Leveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry. We made a date and six or eight of us went over and met him at Castle Dale and
85

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
talked to him about it. He encouraged us, go ahead, now he said, "I can get you one of the most perfect dinosaur skulls that has ever been found. It is not an original, it is a cast, put together by Princeton University, of the head of a dinosaur found at the Cleveland Lloyd Quarry. It's one of the best ones that's ever been found. The original is in the Smithsonian or Peabody Museum, or
MT: ED:
some place back east, but I can get you this cast. This is a real bargain, I can get you a cast for fifty dollars." I gave him the fifty dollars and pretty soon we got this cast. Now, we had opened up the Museum in the meantime. We got this cast and that was the first exhibit as far as dinosaurs were concerned. That cast was later put on the head of our Allosaurus dinosaur, which we got from Dr. Stokes. We had to pay Dr. Stokes for those bones. He was kind of operating the quarry at that time, under the supervision of the University of Utah and he was head of the Geology Department at the University of Utah. That was the start of the dinosaur situation.
How were you funding this up to now?
Okay, we funded it out of our own pockets to begin with. We used to pull shenanigans, I guess, we'd put Jim Diamanti on the Board because he promised us one hundred dollars, so we put him on the Board. Jim Diamanti donated us the one hundred dollars, then the Chamber of Commerce,
86

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
the Price Chamber of Commerce, gave us one thousand dollars, which was really the financial beginning of the Museum. We had a lot of financial problems. We tried for years to get the gymnasium in the Price City Hall. They wouldn't talk to us. The Mayor at the time was Bill Welsh. Now, Bill was a good friend of mine and I kept
riding about getting the gymnasium and his story would be, "Well Doc, you guys got this little Museum here but maybe tomorrow it may be gone." Well, these were about twelve fellows that had gone to school to Don Burge, they were the primary Jeep Patrol Members, most of them rock hounds. Eventually we saw that we had to do something, we had to maybe try to get some funds. We didn't know what to do. We thought of forming a corporation of our own and trying to operate on our own. We finally decided to give it to the College because they had the academic and scientific background to back this thing up. Now, about that time, Dr. John Tucker carne to the College, he was the President of the College and Dr. Tucker pitched in and helped us. Before Tucker got here we were trying to work with the College. The guy up there was Burton Shaw and he made lots of promises but he never helped us. John Tucker pitched in, helped us out in every way he could. Now, you remember, for a short period of time Carbon College carne under the supervision of the University of
87

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
Utah for about a year. So, one thing that Tucker did, he got Ray Olpin down here, who was President of the University of Utah and he saw our little museum and
helped us out. I had a hell of a time putting this archaeological stuff together. The word 'Fremont Culture' didn't mean anything to me. I knew about the Pueblo people, the cliff dwellers and stuff like that, but Fremont was a different thing, it was an Indian culture
that involved primarily Utah. I had been over to the Natural History Museum in Denver, Colorado and had bought some of their booklets and in the back of one of these booklets was an advertisement for a book called "Reappraisal of the Fremont Culture," it was by a Dr. Wormington who was at their Museum in Denver, Colorado.
I bought that book and I went through that book page by page and put together our Fremont Culture stuff here. I labeled it all from that book. This is not an easy thing for me to do. Being a doctor, I thought that culture... what the hell is culture? Is it something that you grow bacteria on or is it something that you make buttermilk out of or something like that? This "Reappraisal of the Fremont" book was a very dull book but very scientifically correct. The night before we were going to open the Museum, I think in May of 1961, I've got a paper on it that I can give you, Don Burge pretty well had his
88

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
geological specimens all labeled. This labelling, the way we did it, we bought a second hand typewriter that printed real big, about one quarter of an inch high. We would type up, on a kind of a thick, tarnish colored paste board-like stuff, the titles that we wanted and
then we'd cut those out and we'd make a little border around it and we'd put a little piece of wood or something on the back and we'd put it in the case. Well, it got up about midnight and Don wasn't through with the typewriter yet. Well, I didn't know how to type any way, but Holly Bryner was there and he said, "Well Doc, I can type." So after Don had gotten all his stuff labeled and had gone home at about midnight, Holly Bryner and I stayed up until eight o'clock the next morning typing up the labels for the archaeological stuff so that the Museum could be opened up at ten o'clock in the morning. Holly could type and I would tell him what to type. Okay, we opened the Museum.
MT: Now, the Museum was in the City Hall, right?
ED: In the City Hall, upstairs in a room, not much bigger than this room here (meaning the Western Mining and Railroad Museum Office), upstairs in the South-West corner of the City Hall. We felt we needed some more help. Dr. Whiting was a great value to me, you know, he helped me out on this stuff. So he and I, I had a plane
89

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
at that time; we'd had the Museum open for several months, we opened it in May and this was probably about August, maybe early September. We flew into Salt Lake, we went up to the University. We had heard that there was an
archaeological department up there but we didn't even know where to find it. At that time, the archaeology department was located in one of the old wooden barracks buildings on campus there. So we went there. They had a little Museum you know, we looked at the stuff and compared what they had and we said we had better than they do. We looked around and nobody there. Finally we got a hold of a man by the name of David Pendergast, who said, "Yes, I'm in charge of the Museum." So Quinn and I
said, "Look, we've opened a little Archaeological Museum down in Price. Can you come down and help us out?" He looked at us like, "Boy, I've, got a couple of nuts on my hands, if I can get rid of these S.O.B.s pretty quick, I better do it." You know I could just read the expression. He said, "Oh yes, I'll help you out. Yes indeed, oh yes, you bet." Three months went by and we hadn't heard from him so I wrote him a letter again. He never answered it. Three months later, I wrote him another letter, no answer. One day, I had a drug salesman come into my office by the name of George Tripp. Now, George Tripp was an amateur archaeologist and he said, "Doc, I think you

got a hold of the wrong man up at the University. I think the man you should get a hold of is Dr. Jesse D. Jennings. He's the man you should get. Now Jennings is a mean S.O.B. and people either love him or hate him, but
I think he is the man you should get a hold of." So I quizzed him for Jennings address, mailing address. So I wrote another letter to Pendergast but I sent a copy of it to Jennings. The next day I had a phone call and the next day Dr. Jennings was here.
MT: Dr. Jennings was in which department? He wasn't an archaeologist was he?
ED: He was the head of the Department of Archaeology and this other guy, Pendergast, worked under him. Jennings is Utah's most famous archaeologist, Jesse D. Jennings. Like I say, I sent this letter, the next day I got a phone call and the next day he said, "I'll be down. I'll call you. I'm going to eat down at Jeanselme's Restaurant." So, about noon that day, I got a call from Dr. Jennings, he said, "This is Dr. J.D. Jennings, I'm down at Jeanselme's, do you want to come down and tell me about this so-called Museum of yours?" So I went down there. Jennings was there with two other men, both archaeologists. Both of these fellows had just returned from some big geological episode in China. I sat down at the table and shook hands with these guys. They didn't
91

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
pay much attention to me, they talked about archaeology
in China and all this stuff. The salad was brought in and Dr. Jennings said to me, "Well now, you've got a Museum here in Price. How many people have you had see your so- called museum?" I said, "Fourteen thousand." He damned near choked to death on the big hunk of lettuce in his salad. So, I took him up to the Museum and he was absolutely amazed. I found that I had mislabeled some things. I had called a carrying basket a storage basket and I had some fakes in there and stuff like that. From then on, Jennings was our friend. He helped us and gave us the status that we needed to go ahead and operate. I was able to go up to Dr. Jennings and they had a storage building where they had all these Indian artifacts from all the digs that they had done twenty years or more, or thirty years or even fifty years. They had them all in storage. They were on shelves screened in by chicken wire and then there would be a key and you could open up the door and they had them all catalogued. I could go up there and he and I would go in there. I would have a list of what I wanted and I could get it. Now that's not true anymore. We didn't get an awful lot of stuff from him. I got a gourd from him, which we still have at the museum, which was used as a storage gourd and it had a hole in it and things like that. Jennings helped us out. This was
92

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
before the University of Utah had their Museum, this was about mid-sixties, this was about 1961 or 1962.
MT: They were quite a bit later, weren't they?
ED: All right, 1968 they opened it. So what happened when we got acquainted with Jennings, Jennings put Dr. Tucker and I on a committee for the formation of the Utah Museum of Natural History in Salt Lake City. Dr. Tucker and I went in there once a month for many months to committee
meetings and such. He finally found out that we didn't know anything. We did help with the formation of the museum. In about 1964, I went into the front lobby of the City Hall in Price and here was Lynn Fausett doing some restoration work on the murals that he had painted there in 1940. He said, "Dr. Dorman, I've got those big murals of Barrier Canyon." He went on to say that he had painted these murals in about 1941, I think. There were two murals. One we have at the Museum, twelve feet high and twenty-three feet wide. There was another mural which was twelve feet high, and, I believe, eighty feet long. Now, Lynn Fausett had painted those for some Indian Organization which had been funded by the Federal Government. It was right at the beginning of the war. They were taken to New York City, displayed in some big Museum back there. I've got the name of it at home, Museum of the Fine Arts. The war came along. This Indian
93

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
organization went out of existence, these canvases were rolled up and put in the basement of a museum in Denver. They were pretty well forgotten about until the early 1960's when the Amon Carter Museum, I believe, in Dallas, Texas; the Amon Carter Museum was a museum founded by
this Amon Carter who was a very, very wealthy Texan. They found out that they were in storage. They had Lynn Fausett unroll them and restore them a little bit and they were then put on display in the Amon Carter Museum in Dallas, Texas. There was a great write-up about it all over the country and they got a lot of publicity, and a publication even, about it. Lynn said to me, "Now, these big murals are going to go on tour pretty soon. They are going to be displayed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, back East some place. But, when they come back, let's get them for your museum here in Price because this is where they belong. The location is close by, let's try to get them." So Lynn and I started working on this . He had correspondence with the curator at the Amon Carter Museum. He knew Senator Moss in Salt Lake City. Senator Moss came down here and I talked to him and Lynn talked to him to try to get these murals. In the meantime, they had finished their tour and they were back in storage in Denver. Well Lynn and I kept trying and there were just reams of correspondence, you know, with Moss and whatnot.
94

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
Nobody could make up their mind who these things belonged to because this certain Indian Organization, I can't
remember the name of it, had gone out of existence. But they were in storage at the Museum over in Denver. So finally, I phoned Dr. Wormington, who was this gal who had written the book Reappraisal of the Fremont Culture, and who was the curator in charge of the Denver Museum of Natural History. I said, "Who is the boss over at the Museum of Fine Arts in Denver?" I told her about these murals and she gave me the name of a man, his name was Brock, B-R-0-C-K, Brock. She gave me his name and phone number, so I called him. I gave him this sales pitch about how Lynn Fausett was from Price, he had painted the murals, the locale was close by, Barrier Canyon was close by and so on. He listened to me for a little while and he said, "Dr. Dorman," he talked with a very teutonic accent, "We have these murals here in storage, we consider that they belong to us because we have them in our possession and for your information, we are building a new five million dollar museum to properly display these murals." Well hell, I gave up. Then, I was invited by Dr. Jennings to the opening of the new Museum of Natural History in Salt Lake City and I hadn't been there
for quite a while. I went in there, and here was this big mural on display. The Barrier Canyon Mural, the one that
95

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
was twelve feet high and eighty feet long was on display. They only displayed sixty feet of it because they didn't have room for the entire mural. God, here I was amazed,
I'd almost forgotten about this mural. I'd given up all hope. So, I said to Jennings, "How the hell did you ever get those murals?" He said, "Well, here's what happened. They're building this new museum over in Denver and they wanted to feature a lot of South-American, Middle- American artifacts, and we had a whole slew of artifacts here from South-America that we had a book value on, of about sixty-thousand dollars, and we traded those Central American artifacts to them for the murals." Well, that's how they got them. The smaller mural, they never displayed, so I put in a plea to Dr. Jennings and wrote a letter to make it official, and requested this mural. So, he gave us the mural which we now have, and they retained the big mural. They've still got it on display. Then, we had this mural. Don Haig was the Curator at the Museum of Natural History at that time. Jennings had kind of gone into the back. So Don Haig designed for us, a framework to put around this twelve by twenty-three foot mural of the Holy Ghost and we'd built that framework and the picture was hung. It's on canvas, it's a very delicate painting. Hanging it on the canvas, it didn't have proper protection. Kids would wad up newspaper when
96

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
you weren't watching, you know, this happens here, and
throw it at it and cause the paint to check a little bit. So when we got our new museum, we took this picture down, we cut it into three segments, each eight foot wide. That's the way it had been put together, it had been sold and painted over. You couldn't tell it, but we had to cut
those stitches. We took it over to the conservatory at B.Y.U., who cleaned it, put protective clear material over it to protect it and then we got it rehung. It cost us several thousand dollars to get that done. That's the way things work out.
MT: Now, when did the College take over? How was the funding done?
ED: Okay. It took over shortly ... about the time we opened the museum. No, it was later than that. When we gave it to the College, they were able to get some funds through the Legislature. We didn't get very much, you know, a couple thousand dollars a year to begin with. I can't give you the figures right now, but probably one hundred thousand dollars a years they'd be getting now, through the
L egislature.
MT: When did they move it downstairs?
ED: I can't tell you exactly, probably in the 1970's. After
we voted Bill Welsh out as Mayor, and we got a new regime in as the Mayor and City Council, they began to see the
97

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
advantage of the museum and so they let us move downstairs. Now, that was a hell of a job, you know. Then we had to do lots of things there. The entire ceiling in the gymnasium was big, iron struts. We came up with the
idea that we would spray paint all of the superstructure of iron and steel up above. We got a guy in there with a spray gun, and, I don't know, it took fifty gallons or more paint and he spray painted it. It didn't look bad because it was blue, it was dark colored, it almost had a sky resemblance. It did away with the ugliness of that. Later on, as you know, we got other help. I go into that museum now and I look at it and I still don't believe it.
no money. We used to pitch in a few dollars to buy this or that, you know. We chipped in, out of our own pockets, the money to buy paint. I didn't know, early on, before we opened the museum, how to fix up those showcases. These old showcases that we had from Castle Gate, to make presentable for Indian artifacts. So, I went down to Price Commission and I bought some old burlap. They had sheets of this burlap there, they were about four feet wide, the real course burlap. I put that in the cases, but it was brown. It was a very dull color. If you put an Indian artifact on it, a beautiful arrowhead or a pot or
Isn't it incredible?
MT:
ED: We started out with nothing, absolutely nothing, we had
98

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
something, it had no life to it. So, I went and I got a water soluble paint. I got pinks and blues and tans, light colored tans, and I painted this burlap just slightly, enough to color it a little bit to display these artifacts on. That helped out. We'd have one shelf of blue, another one tan, another one pink or something,
to give it a background.
MT: The displays were spectacular in that first museum, as
ED:
they are today. Today, you have room and space.
I can't tell you what year Dr. Whiting died, probably the late 1970's. At his funeral, we said, "In lieu of flowers, donations for the museum.11 We needed a big, beautiful, proper case to display the Fremont Culture, in one big case. We got seventeen hundred dollars, that would have been spent for flowers. Okay, so that was the start of getting funds to build this big 'Fremont' case that we now have down there. These were made in Salt Lake City, under the supervision of Merrill Hamilton, who drew up the plans for them. Not only that case, but many of our cases. Merrill was a sharp person, you know, he could do this. It finally cost fifty-four hundred dollars for the case.
[TAPE 3 SIDE 1]
Repeating, we got this contributions of seventeen hundred
dollars from, "In lieu of flowers, 11 for Dr. W hiting's 99
ED:

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
funeral. Eventually, we finally got this Fremont Case built. The case alone cost us fifty-four hundred dollars. Merrill Hamilton designed the inside of the case, the scenery, the painting in there and he ... I put the Fremont case together. I think we got it together in about 1981, somewhere along in there . That's my last major contribution that I made to the Museum because, then we got people like Pam Miller, who's a trained archaeologist, not a dummy like me, who was trained and had an educational background. Pam has now taken over and
MT: ED:
MT: ED: MT: ED:
I don't have to worry about anything anymore because Pam can do it, you see.
Exactly.
She can do it better than I could because she has the training and the background to do it. Let's fold up.
I just want to ask you one more thing.
One more thing, all right.
The book that you wrote, when did you write the book?
I put together this archaeology book. I got it together in about 1979. Now, I started out in this way, as we had
just opened the museum, we used to have lectures where people in the community could come in and learn about the museum and learn about the Fremont Culture and all that stuff. So they could direct tourists to the museum, see. So I had these series of lectures, I'd give a lecture
100

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
through one night a week and it would go on for several weeks and then the lectures would increase a little bit, so I kept building up this material and building it up all the time. Finally I began working on putting this thing in the form of a book. I started out with a little booklet about that thick and it gradually increased in
its scope until I put together the Archaeology of Eastern Utah, with special reference to the Fremont Culture. Now, this is a hell of a job, my secretary did an awful lot of the typing. To begin with, there was a fellow at the College, I can't remember his name at the moment, who said, "Typing is no problem, I can get a secretary in and we'll type it up." We had to type it up, then we'd have it photo offset and bound into a book, see. But, the typing had to be perfect because that was what was photographed to go into the book, so he hired a secretary up at the college. I didn't get anything back, I go up, and here is this secretary who was typing away and she had a wastebasket here full of discarded stuff and another wastebasket over here, and paper all over the floor and no finished material. Finally, I got about ten pages out of her and when you held them up to the light, they were all white out, lots of mistakes, you see. This is pre-computer typing, preword processing typing. So, you had to be a good typist, if you made mistakes, you
101

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
were in trouble.
MT: That's right.
ED: So, I pinned this guy down one time, at a Museum Board
Meeting. "How much is it going to cost me to get this typing?" Typing in those days, there were professional typists who would do theses for students in school, Master's Thesis, Ph.D. Thesis. The charge was a dollar or a dollar and a quarter per page. It had figured out that this was costing me six dollars and eighty cents a page to get this typist to do it. This guy's name was Fairbanks. I said to hell with that stuff. So, I took the stuff away from this gal and made Fairbanks mad, because he wanted to be the boss, you know, and throw his weight around. I hired other people in town to do the typing. My secretary did an awful lot of it, Joyce Marsing. That took us months to get a perfect copy, you know. It had to be perfect.
MT: Exactly.
ED: Then we, I think in 1979, I put out the first edition of
the book. Peczuh Press printed it for me. I finally had, I believe, a total of fifteen hundred copies of this
printed up. You've got a copy here, I think.
MT: I have my own personal copy.
ED: Yes. Now, those were sold all over the state. Sam Wellers
Book Store in Salt Lake sold them, the State Historical 102

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
Society sold them. I peddled them around to Trading Posts in Colorado and Southern Utah, and I sold fifteen hundred copies of them. Now, I've got two or three copies left and that's all. Now, perhaps I should update and reprint it. If I did, I'd have to update it, you know, do a lot of this stuff so I've given up on it.
MT: So you can't buy any more copies at the museum?
ED: No, you can't buy them anywhere.
MT: Well, I'll keep my treasure. Now, before we finish, I
want you to tell us about your family, your children and your wife. Just sort of round yourself out, because you haven't been doing all of this without having a family and raising a family and doing all of these other things.
ED: Well, when I came back here from Philadelphia in 1941 to practice here in Price, my wife and I at that time, had a kind of a disagreement. We got a divorce. I eventually married Maurine Peacock, who was born and raised in Price. She was an R.N. educated at the Holy Cross Hospital in Salt Lake and working at the hospital. I had one daughter at Consumers, Marcia, who now lives in Denver. Maurine and I had three children, two boys and a girl. The oldest boy is Jaime, who is now in San Diego. Dorry, who is now in Alaska and my daughter Kathy, who is married and has three children and lives in Layton.
MT: And what are your boys doing?
103

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
ED: Okay, my oldest boy Jaime is involved in the computer
MT: ED: MT:
ED:
business. He works for a company, big company, called DH Company, who makes printers for special uses like printing of envelopes, other special use printers. Dorry, at the moment, is teaching school in Alaska as a substitute teacher. He likes this because he doesn't have to work every day and he can get out and see the country. But, the children have done well and we are pleased and happy with them.
Anything else you would like to add?
No. I'm getting hungry and I know you are too.
Thank you so much Dr. Dorman. This has been a great treat for me.
But, I'm glad we went into this museum business because we had a lot of problems there. You see now, I've got involved with this Jeep Safari business, which I take groups out to see the rock art in this area. But, having Pam M iller in the Museum, a trained archaeologist, things can be done better.
Don Burge is still the ...
Don Burge is classified as the director and Pam Miller is
the curator.
Oh, she is the curator.
Yes. The reason, I think, the curator of archaeology, but they put her over everything and that lets Don boss
MT: ED:
MT: ED:
104

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
things more or less, you see. Originally, I think the titles were, Don Surge was director and curator of geology and Pam Miller was curator of archaeology. I think Pam is doing more than any archaeology work right now. I think you know that they're getting in an exhibit of some kind from, I believe, from Ohio or Back East, which will be displayed in the gallery. We've had Gary
Smith's photos of rock art on display. We've taken those down, we've got a new display coming in. Then, last year we had all of Gary Prazen's stuff.
MT: Yes, and all of the pictures from the Museum.
ED: Right, right.
MT: Now, those pictures hand here in our Museum.
ED: Now you see, with Pam doing this work, she works at it a
little bit every day, they can go out and get these other exhibits and they know how to do it. There is so much bureaucracy, as you found out, in these Museums. You know, you've got to get the right people at the right time with the right figures, you know, and all that stuff.
MT: So now they're able to pay people to come in and do a lot of this. Do they still have the volunteers?
ED: Yes, yes they do. A lot of volunteers do my work. I don't do anything anymore except go on these Jeep safaris. Yes, we have a lot of volunteer people and...
105

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
MT:
ED:
Thank God for the volunteers or we wouldn't have anything in this county.
That's true, and these things wouldn't get started if it wasn't for the volunteers. Now, I think you know that the College, and essentially the Museum, recently purchased the old gymnasium that was for the Job Corps, out south of Price.
Oh really?
You probably had to do the same, but that's the way to go, make it a gift then make sure it's yours.
Well, then you've got those Pilling figurines. Are the originals still in the Museum?
Yes. Now, what happened...
Everyone in the country wanted those.
What happened, on those, as you know, Clarence Pilling's
family moved here in about 1950. We had problems with Clarence at first, he'd let us display them and then he'd get mad at us for something and he'd come in and take the damn things out, put them in a case and put them under his bed. Then, he'd displayed them for a while down in the Carbon-Emery Bank, then he took them out of there, take them home and put them under the bed. Finally, the BLM, more or less, confiscated those. They said they had been found on BLM ground. To protect them from future stuff, they actually, more or less took them away from
MT: ED:
MT:
ED: MT: ED:

 DR. ELDON DORMAN
Clarence Pilling and gave them to us at the museum.
MT: Is that how that finally turned out?
ED: Yes. Now you see, you're quoting me here, but I'm not
sure of all of this, but that's essentially how it happened. Yes. Turn it off, and I'll tell you something else.
MT: Are we through here?
ED: Yes.
MT: Except for the story we're not going to record. Thank you
so much.
ED: Turn this one off.
