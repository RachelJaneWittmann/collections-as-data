Then you got on a ship at what port?
I got on a train and then I go to Monopoli, now a city called Monopoli. From Monopoli I take a train, I go to another city and then I take a boat.
Oh, I see and then you came to New York and then took the train to Carbon County in this area?
Yes.
Now, when you first came to Carbon County what did it impress you as? Were the people friendly would you say?
Yes, I lived up in Sunnyside and everybody was friendly, yes.
Did you have trouble with your language barriers?
Not bad, no. But I only spoke Italian at that time, you know.
Oh, I see, uh huh. Like your present occupation-- What's that? [Break]
I would like to ask you something about the occupations. Like, the main occupation around here is definitely mining, were you a miner or did you go into the mines?
No, I work on the section for a while.
The railroad section?
Yes, the railroad section, yes.
Now, was this still up at Sunnyside that you were

 N I C GUZZO # 1 working there?
NG: Yes.
MB: I see. What track were you laying there, what track,
NG:
MB:
NG:
MB: NG: MB:
NG:
MB:
NG: MB:
you know, what type of--
Oh, just come from Price, the railroad track you know.
Uh huh, was it from Price to Sunnyside that they were laying the track?
No, but for a while it was Sunnyside then for six miles you know, nobody'd bother you. It was across that area you know.
Now, after the section, what occupation did you take? Then I go into the mine.
Then you went into the mine. What were some of the-- well, like did you meet a lot of friends, what were
some of the people you were acquainted with at that time? Who did you meet while working on the section and in the mine?
Ah, I meet a Spanish guy, Mexican, but of course I call him Spanish, a lot of Italians, you know, and they was friendly.
Well, I guess you had to work together and it was quite a risk working together.
Yes.
So you just kind of stayed together and all. Let me

 N I C
GUZZO # 1
see, did you ever--you know when you came into this country did you ever plan on returning to the old country again, say work for some money and then go back?
Yes, for a few years, yes. For the first three, four years, yes.
Did you ever go back to the old country then?
Well, I go in 1966-68 you know, four years ago.
That's just recently.
Yes, four years ago. But I don't want to go back that way you see.
Well, what did you think of the old country after you went back, were you glad to get back here to America? Uh huh, you betcha, I was ready to go back again to America.
Like, you know, when you came to this country, did you expect to find anything that you did find? Like was it hard applying for a job? Did you have a hard
time applying for a job?
No, not at that time. There was a lot of work. 1920- 21 there was a lot of work, and then 1929-30 it started to go down a little bit.
Yes, it just started to kind of go down?
Yes.
Now, what about machinery, did they have a lot of

NG:
MB: NG: MB:

 N I C GUZZO # 1
machinery in the camp?
NG: No, not at that time in 1920, no.
MB: But then about 1930 machinery started coming in then? NG: Yes.
MB: Then that's why the labor kind of slowed down?
NG: Yes.
MB: What adjustments did you have to make to everyday
life? Like what about the food, did it change much
when you came over here, did you experience--? NG: No.
MB: You just still eat your pasta?
NG: Yes. Somebody says it different. For me it's just the
same you know, I don't make no difference.
MB: What did you generally eat over in South Italy, was
it just mainly, did you have your pasta over there? NG: We had pasta by the pound, once every six months, all day in 1920. So I'd always eat at that time cabbage,
no meat either.
MB: No meat over in Italy?
NG: No, we eat meat once or twice a year.
MB: That's quite a treat then.
NG: Yes, Christmas Eve, New Year, and Easter Sunday,
that's all.
MB: And Easter Sunday?
NG: Three times a year, that's all. So no meat.
7

 N I C GUZZO # 1
MB: Oh, uh huh. Then when you came over to America was
meat quite abundant, would you say?
NG: Yes, I would say so.
MB: You ate quite a bit of it then? Then like you had
NG: MB:
NG: MB:
your farmers who went and brought the land around here maybe and farmed and raised a couple of cows and all.
Yes.
Then, like we have a pasta frazoli, the spaghetti and beans, you know my grandmother is always fixing that up.
Yes I know, I like the pasta fajoli, yes.
And we eat that along with fish and we mainly have it around Lent or you know, different holidays like that. I guess she started eating that when she came over; her family started eating that when they came over to America. They never had it over in Italy. You know, they had a lot of fish, but maybe, you know. Yes, we had fish the ---?--- was in the farm, it was far from the city you know, like a ---?--- you know. Now, I leave on the farm, there was a little farm here, and they came to bring the fish everyday you know. They came and bring it in and they had a little meat I guess, you know, because I had no money to buy meat, you know. Fish and meat, you had no money to
NG:

 N I C GUZZO # 1
buy it. You know, you've got to eat spuds, minestra, you know. That's all, no coffee in the morning, no.
MB: No coffee.
NG: Oh no.
MB: Well, what did you drink in place of it, say, did you
have your wine over in Italy?
NG: Oh, we had a little wine, yes.
MB: Just a little?
NG: Yes.
MB: When you came over to America, I guess wine was quite
abundant, wasn't it?
NG: At that time we had wine yes, 1920 you can make wine. MB: Did you ever make it yourself when you came over to
America, make your own wine?
NG: No, when I come to America and I got married I was
making it, yes.
MB: Now, what year did you get married in?
NG: 1925.
MB: And she was from Italy too, was she Italian?
NG: No, she was born here.
MB: Oh, she was born in Carbon County. Do you recall any
personal experience that might interest us concerning the early years in Carbon County, like specific events like mine catastrophes, like up in Sunnyside? Was there any mine catastrophes or bank robberies or
9

 N I C GUZZO # 1 anything?
NG: Oh no, none of that.
MB: Nothing of that? Like, they didn't have the
catastrophes up in the mines, like up in Standardville, my grandfather got killed in that real bad mine catastrophe they had up there. We have the old newspapers saying--
NG: Oh yes, they all dead from the explosion in the mine. MB: Now, what was that up in Sunnyside, did they have
anything there?
NG: They had a fire in the Number Two Mine, but it don't
kill nobody you see, everybody come out.
MB: What about dances and partying, how was that?
NG: What's that?
MB: Dances and parties.
NG: Oh, sometime they have a big dance too, but not like
it is now you know, not every week or every night,-- -?---. In those days we didn't have no car, you know. So inside we had two cars but that happen my way you
know.
MB: Who was the doctor?
NG: Dr. Dowd.
MB: Dr. Dowd? Oh.
NG: He's dead now, you know. He here one out of my way,
and now they've got a Dodge, ---?--- Dodge you know. 10

GUZZO # 1
Nobody else have a car, you were to bring groceries with your horse you know, wagon, you know.
Now, did you carry on any of your old country ways when you first carne to America? Like you mentioned your holidays--well, your wine making and all. Now, what about the marriage customs, the music and dances, did they play the old music from Italy, you know, the Italian people up at the coal mining camps? Yes.
What were some of your favorite songs, did you have
any?
Oh the waltz you know, polka, whatever you want to call it, you know.
What about the musical instruments, did they have accordions up at the coal camps?
Yes, in Sunnyside they had accordions, yes.
What about any songs or favorite songs, any name of a specific names of songs?
Well, I can tell you about some of the Italian songs, but I love them here in America you know, there is Doris Day you know, singing "Whatever W ill Be W ill Be."
You like--oh, I see. Could you tell us about any other people that were around here at that time, like your friends, any other Italian friend that you

GUZZO # 1
really knew a lot about and that would be living now and that could help us with our project you know, that could tell us something? Like my old uncle I know would be one. I wish I could have interviewed Sam, but I don't know. Like, some of the things that you might think that he would tell me, like what he went through in life and what he thought. Would you know of anything of what his life was like or some of
the other people's life was like and if they had a hard time adjusting?
Now, you know, like in Vienna.
Like, did Sam have a hard time adjusting to this area would you say?
Well, in 1930--
[END OF SIDE ONE]
--however, I shall clarify a few things that he went
on to say. He left off by saying, "in 1930," and by this he was referring to the time of the Depression and what the Italian people living in this era endured. He was mainly a laboring man, he bought no land when he came over here or he cared nothing for farming because he said that he was a little boy over in Italy when his father did the basic farming of the land and he never really learned the skill or he never cared to. So he mainly lived off a warehouse

 N I C
GUZZO # 1
store up in Dragerton, and the name was also given and I'll check with him again to see what the name was. Now, during the Depression times were hard, he raised three children, and his wife had left him and all. During the Depression the children were without a lot of things that we have now. Like generally their clothes were full of patches, they had one pair of shoes to their name and they had very rational food as far as that went. Like to buy from the company store you could only buy so much, and I asked him if you were able to get food from your friends that did have a farm and he said no, because of a lack of transportation and all. Another thing that he mentioned was that the storehouse he did use the script to go and buy things, and that during the Depression he only worked once a month and maybe got paid as low as five dollars. It really wasn't worth the effort. Like he lived in a small shack up in Dragerton in one of those mining shacks, and the conditions were very poor. Although they had electricity and running water at times and all, he still claims that it was far better than what it was over in Old Italy and that he was quite lucky to be here in America. [break] Another thing is that when he wanted to come to Price there was a top of a
13

 N I C
GUZZO # 1
stagecoach--well, this was about in the middle of the
'20s--that he would board for $2.50 and he would only come down to Price once or twice a year for festive occasions maybe or shopping, if you had the money, but during the Depression you were not able to do this, in fact you were isolated in the area. Then he also mentioned that he moved to the mine of Columbia. Now, it was not as large as the Sunnyside Mine was, and so maybe the coal was not as productive there or there was not that much work in Columbia. But the fact is that Columbia was far behind in progress compared to Sunnyside as far as instruments to work with. Like, Nick Guzzo is generally a very carefree man, it seemed like a lot of the things in life that did happen, like the prohibition and organizations taking place to reform the young, you know the Italian establishment, way of living and all, and to broaden themselves, you know, like the Italian organization. He said that he was never involved in any legal matters other than the time that he divorced his wife and that he has not seen his wife for forty years. He had various other personal things that I'm sure he did not care to mention. Beyond that he seemed--he's quite happy with the American way of living. He was thrilled that he was over here in
14

 N I C
GUZZO # 1
America and that when he went back to Italy just
recently in '68, he cared not for the country, and that he was glad to be back here. He retired in '54 I think it was, from the mine of Columbia, and then he moved here to Price. He knows several people like Mrs. Priano, which he mentioned came here six years before him, and also he knew my grandfather, Sam Bruno, and--well, my step-grandfather, Sam Bruno, and my grandfather, Michael Bruno. He mentioned various things about their personality and their way of living here and how my grandfather, Michael, was always one to buy land and live off the land and all and how he never cared to live off the land. He also mentioned that my grandfather played the guitar. He did not play it for money or anything, just for festive occasions, they would pull out the guitar and play it and that. He suggested that I do talk to Mrs. Priano; she would be a very good source. [Break] He also mentioned another good source of information would be from Tom Nicolavo who worked in the coke ovens when he was eleven years old. Up at Sunnyside he worked in them, and he also mentioned about the warehouse and about the main basic source of food, that you could go in there and buy almost anything, like they had the clothes and all this. The money
15

 N I C
GUZZO # 1
basically stayed with the company, it never circulated, say to the government or anything, it was always there to the company. When you had script you bought from the store. Sometimes you got a bonus, a dollar bonus if you were lucky. He mentioned about
the coal mining, like you went in and you hauled a ton a day and you were paid--you weren't paid or you didn't mark it down until you came out, until they weighed them out, and then you were tagged and all of this. [break] It seems if anything was to make a great impression upon Nick at that time it was the Depression, and I think he was very touched by it, at the fact of living in poverty somewhat like over in Italy, but he still claims that it was not as bad. You ask him things if he liked the old country music and all and he'll reply, "Not really." You know, he liked it well enough, but not that he cared it to be his favorite compared to some of the modern-day singers in all of America at that time, such as Doris Day like he mentioned. I say this because it would be nice if this tape will be continued some day and ask more dealing with the Depression and what he had said about the times of the 1930s and the early 1930s.
