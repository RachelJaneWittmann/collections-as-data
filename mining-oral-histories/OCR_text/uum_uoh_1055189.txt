 T H I S I S MITCH HADDARD INTER VIEWING MR. LEON F R A Z I E R , A PROVO ATTORNEY, IN HIS OFFICE ON JULY 22, 1970 AT 10:45 IN THE MORNING. T H I S INTER VIEW A P ART OF THE UT AH URANIUM OR A L H I S T O R Y P R O J E C T I N C O - O P E R A T I O N W I T H C A L . S T A T E A T FULLERTON. (INTERVIEW # 1 )
MH: Okay, Mr. Frazier, as we stated in the pre-interview, the first thing I'd like to ask is a little bit about yourself.
LF: Well, I'm a native of Utah. I was born in Provo and have practiced here all but four years. I was in California from '51 to '54 on Howard Hughes' legal staff. From '63 to '64, I was in Denver, Colorado as head of a bank holding company. I graduated from Provo High School, and attended the Brigham Young University in 1942 and '43. I went into the military service in '43 in the spring of '43 and was in the coast artillery, initially, and went into pilot training and was a pilot during World War Two. I joined the reserve after I got out in 1945, and I started attending the University of Utah in January of 1946. I graduated from the University of Utah iná 1949 with a bachelor's degree and an L.L.B. And then because I had my bachelor's degree after they instituted the juris-doctorate program at the University of Utah, I got my juris-doctorate from the
University of Utah. I started practicing law in Provo in October of 1949, and practiced here until May of 1951 when I went to California and was on Howard

 LEON FRAZIER #1
Hughes' legal staff until May of 1954, when I again returned to Utah and practiced in Utah, in Provo, until 1963, the spring of '63. Then I went to Denver and stayed there for about a year and came back and have practiced here since that time. I passed the bar
in California and I'm a member of the California Bar Association as well as the Utah Bar Association. And I've had a lot of contact with the mining industry since 1954 in different areas. I don't specialize in mining law, but I do sort of specialize in real property law and litigations, and so as a result I've organized a lot of mining companies and particularly uranium companies, and have been personally associated with it as an investor and as an attorney.
MH: What would you feel then are the chief problem areas legally of uranium mining?
LF: Well, the uranium mining business sort of followed a cycle, I think. When I first came back to Utah in 1954, the uranium boom was just getting started. Steen's discovery had been announced down in southern
Utah, and there was a great flurry of location of claims during that time. All over the Colorado Plateau and all up into Utah, and Nevada, and Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. So in '54 and '55, when I first really began getting active in
2

 LEON FRAZIER #1
it, the big problem was legal problems relating to the location of claims. We had developing in both the federal courts and state courts what was equivalent to quiet title actions. We were trying to sort out who the owners of the property were because there were a lot of floating claims at that time. Nobody could really tie them down. There were uranium handbooks being published by a lot of different people, geologists, on how to locate properties, and then books on how to stake claims. There was a lot of misinformation being circulated and there were a lot of people staking over claims and staking on state lands that were school sections that weren't open to location where they should have properly been leased from the state. So in the initial periods, two year I would say, it was a question of trying to sort out the wheat from the chaff to see who really had the kernel, where the uranium was supposed to be located, if we're talking just about uranium. Then there was a lot of speculation as to whether the uranium claims ought to be really a places location or whether it ought to be a lode location because there were a lot
of different theories about where the uranium came from; whether it came through a hot percolation process or whether it was laid down in stream beds
3

 LEON FRAZIER #1
and was actually in sight and in place where you could locate it with a lode claims. And so there were a lot of them that were doing both, locating lode claims and placer claims. And so you have a whole area of law developing during that period of time, as it related to the type of location you should have on it, and what extent of ore you had to have in order to prove that you had mineralization, and then who was first in point of time, and when the actual location or discovery took place as recorded under the law. Then you had a lot of states like Nevada and others in the area that required different proofs of labor. In nevada you had to dig pits and so you had these bulldozers going in and just digging across the desert every six hundred to fifteen hundred feet.
Miles of just gouges in the ground. And then we had a lot of problems because stock men were complaining about their cattle falling into these traps. There was no obvious mineral location, but they had to do that discovery work. In some of the other areas they'd have to drill so many feet of hold, and there was lot of drilling. And we got into a period of real concern with the Forest Service, and the National Park Service, and the cattlemen, and the sheepmen because of the activities taking place all over the
4

 LEON FRAZIER #1
mountain with prospectors out like flies trying to
find uranium. So we had lots of trespass problems, and we had lots of quiet title actions. And then after we began sorting out the titles and find out who owned the properties, there was a period of great activity in penny stocks, and the organization of corporations, and filing with S.E.C. and Denver and San Francisco on regulation-A qualifications, primarily where they were trying to raise less than three hundred thousand dollars. Many of these issues would be sold out before they ever hit the market, and before you could even get them qualified. We had several issues that we had to send money back to people because they were completely over-subscribed before you could ever even get the issues into the hands of a broker. You wouldn't even need and underwriter. And so we had a lot of securities problems that started developing, and there was just a real fever of speculation on uranium stocks. We had the penny stock boom and we had all of the new companies being formed to handle brokerage and underwritings. There was lots of money made by people just organizing the companies and the commissions that they were getting for selling the stock, and gradually the state's Securities Commission caught up
5

 LEON FRAZIER #1
with the problem and reduced the amount of commission that the salesmen and underwriters could take. They added additional staffs on with the S.E.C. in Denver, the departmentalized it to the point that they had to geology division and legal division and the accounting division, and the organization gradually came out of chaos. The S.E.C. in Denver, for
instance, which was responsible for Utah, Colorado, the western, or the eastern part of the Colorado Plateau here. It used to be in 1 54 and 1 55 and even into '56 that you could go to Denver and walk an issue through in a day and get the recommended changes in your prospectus and your regulation-A qualification and we had no problems. As they became inundated with filings and added all the new staff, then we had to take a little longer, and we had to satisfy all of the different departments. There were definite legal problems connected with the tremendous boom that happened, I would say, from 1 54 to '57. We started having a lot of stockholder problems because many stockholders got into companies that just didn't have properties. We had a lot of tax problems because the unsophisticated organizers and even some
unsophisticated attorneys got some of their clients into real trouble by taking properties into
6

 LEON FRAZIER #1
corporation for stock after the corporation had been organized, and they were pricing the stock at fantastic values based upon the value of claims that were just being arbitrarily set by boards or directors. And so you had people taking stock for claims that was subject to tax, that is, the stock they took was subject to income tax because they were
in effect selling their properties. This was usually after the corporations had been organized. And then the Internal Revenue Service got into the act and started coming back into taking these people that were taking stock in companies for fantastic amounts or fantastically large blocks of stock for properties that had never been proved, just arbitrarily set values that were astronomical. I remember one day on the office I had two men arguing whether the particular properties that they were into this company were worth seven or eight million dollars. And they argued back and forth whether they were going to value them at seven or eight million dollars. I finally told them that it really didn't
matter whether it was seven or eight million dollars, and they could keep talking as long as they wanted, but I was charging them twenty dollars an hour for my time, and if they wanted to keep talking, I was
7

 LEON FRAZIER #1
willing to listen. They soon arrived at an evaluation because twenty dollars was a lot more important to them, I'm sure, than the million-dollar difference that they had over these claims. But that was the problem. There were astronomical values placed on these claims and lots of people got into real tax difficulty. And so there were a lot of internal
revenue problems that we had to content with. And then there started developing in the law a lot of cases and decisions, both by the Securities and Exchange Commission and in actual case law, by people who were concerned about what their rights as stockholders were in companies. There were discoveries being made that were never told to the stockholders until the officers and the insiders get out and pick either more properties in the area which they would often do in their own name, or they would go out and buy up what stock they could, and then make the announcement and make tremendous profits on it. And of course, this problem started back really as far as I was concerned, my connection with it, in 1 54, and on up until it really culminated in the case that was handed down by the Supreme Court of the United States in the Texas Gulf Sulphur case, as it applied to officers and directors and their
8

 LEON FRAZIER #1
responsibilities on disclosure in connection with the Timmons (?) strike up in Canada recently. Those problems began developing I think directly and
indirectly as a result of the uranium boom, lots of them, because there was such fever in all areas, particularly here on the Colorado Plateau. I think that the Securities and Exchange Commission has far more problems with enforcement of these penny-stock programs than they do with the large offerings that are handled through brokerage houses that have seats on the New York Exchange. I attended a seminar this spring back in New York for securities dealers, and they had the enrollment from the Securities and Exchange Commission in from Washington, all of the top people from the S.E.C. There weren't too many of us from out West here that attended the seminar. It was put on by the practicing law institute. It was a three-day seminar and it was designed primarily for attorneys who handle brokerage houses on Wall Street and the investment community in the East. But they had a tremendous problem with these uranium issues because issues were being handled by different smaller brokerage houses in the East, from '54 on up until '57, '58, and they were making fortunes out of it because they were selling the issues before they
9

 LEON FRAZIER #1
could even get the stock qualified. And so I'm sure that it was a great temptation of many of the brokerage houses to cut corners and get in on some of that very lucrative underwriting business back during that period of time. We had a number of problems and cases develop in our office that related to the brokers, and dealers, and the underwriters, and the commissions, and so on. There were so many problems in connection with the uranium industry that it had a profound effect, in my opinion, on many of the attitudes and positions that brokerage houses are even taking today. At that time many of them would handle over-the-counter stocks, penny stocks, Goodbody and Company, Hogle, and others, and now they've become a little more sophisticated and the
value of the stocks have to be up much higher; one dollar, three dollars, five dollars, whatever the limits they set on it. But at that time, many of the better brokerage houses were handling uranium issues because it was a very lucrative thing to do, and the S. E. C. hadn't laid down as many strict bylines and
guidelines as they have at the present time. It's becoming a more sophisticated problem now. It's being refined. At that time there were lots of problems as there were in the days when they rushed up into the
10

 LEON FRAZIER #1
Alaska or over into California in 1849. It just caught everybody by surprise, and I'm sure that the uranium boom here on the plateau was the same way. It caught the s.E.C. in Denver by surprise; it caught the S.E.C. in Washington by surprise; and it caught the internal Revenue Service by surprise. Any time you have that much money and that much speculation in
the investment market, you're bound to have all kinds of legal problems. And they start right down at the bottom with the location of the claims, they go right on up to the brokerage house, and then down on the other cycle to the individual who's buying the stock through the brokerage house. So the spectrum of legal problems in connection with the uranium industry, in my opinion, is limitless. You and I could talk for days on it. It's even developing now because now they're finding that--well, I'm concerned with the atomic fallout problem, for instance, Hughes is concerned within the Las Vegas area. In the spring of 1954, for instance, we were putting together a package of land west of Las Vegas for Howard Hughes
which became know as Hughes Sit. They also started the atomic testing down there about that time, and Hughes read in the paper that atomic fallout caused sterility. He became so concerned with it that he
11

 LEON FRAZIER #1
moved his entire operation to Nassau in the Bahamas, and wanted me to go with him. That's when I came back to Utah because I didn't want to lived down in Nassau. But that was a direct result of the atomic fallout, and the testing, and the radioactivity that became a legal problem really because of how much of that is falling on the land. Hughes was ready to build a tremendous aircraft factory there in Vegas underground. You see, you have the problem of the Korean War and the fact that submarines had been sited off the California coast. Everybody was on edge. Hughes who had all of his Hughes Aircraft facilities on the edge of the Pacific Coast at Culver City was looking inland for a place to locate some of the more vital departments. And then you get a situation where there's concern about atomic fallout and radiation. It affected the whole economy, possibly, of the area because Hughes moved out in affect. That land has never been developed. It's still sitting there. He's gone back in and invested the money that he got out of TWA in the casinos and so forth, but the land has never been developed west
of Vegas. Essentially, this becomes a legal problem. How much fallout are you going to allow? You have levels of radiation developing in mines and people
12

 LEON FRAZIER #1
that start working in these mines where uranium is present. And so you have a whole field of law which I have not really had too much contact with except what I've read, and what I've had people who have worked
in mines come in and who have suspected they had various ailments because they were overexposed to radioactivity and uranium mines. So you have industrial commission in the plateau states where uranium mining is becoming a concern for the first time with how long can you leave a worker in a uranium mine without him becoming contaminated and exposed to dangerous radioactivity. And so you have a whole field of legal problems developing there as it relates to industrial compensation, which I haven't had too much to do with. But I'm sure that we're going to hear a lot more about it, particularly in these underground mines, you see. People all the time are becoming more concerned about product liability, and there may be great responsibility on the part of these people that are processing uranium ores if the levels of radioactivity that get into even the waste materials on uranium are too high. You see, this is presenting a real problem for some of these companies like Consolidated Edison and New York Electric who have uranium power plants. Where do you dump the
13

 LEON FRAZIER #1
waste, and how do you take care of it, and how do you protect people from contamination? These are all problems that have grown up and are growing up, and are developing even now as a result of the uranium boom.
MH: Do you think then that the emphasis on ecology today, conserving the land and the environment, keeping the environment, this has then presented a whole new field, legally?
LF: I think it has. In fact, in the case of Howard Hughes and his developments in Nevada, I think it's had far- reaching effects. I think that had this uranium testing in Nevada not taken place, Hughes, in all probability, would have stayed there and developed commercial enterprises, you see. And there's great speculation now that he's left Nevada and he's back
down in Nassau in the Bahamas because of all the continued testing that has taken place just outside of Las Vegas. Of course, through his staff and his personnel, he's been conducting his own research and his own evaluations of the program. He has attempted to get support for a cutback in atomic testing, particularly where it may pollute the underground water supplies, and the atomic fallout, the radiation fallout, and so on, on atmospheric testing, and so
14

 LEON FRAZIER #1
forth. I think it's had a profound effect and is having a profound effect on the ecology problems myself. You've got a beautiful atomic plant down just north of San Diego there on the coast, and they are having great difficulty, I understand, in getting developers in too close to that because they're still concerned with the safety factors connected with the uranium handling problems. What happens if it blows up, and what happens to the waste? And it's a little like people used to be about living close to the cemetery, you know. They always though the ghosts were going to go out at night and get them. And there are still a lot of people that don't know enough about the uranium factors and the radiation and so forth that they just stay away from them.
MH: Well, when ~he A.E.C. came into the picture and began to buy up, you know, quantities of uranium as a national commodity, did this present many legal problems when they came in?
LF: Well, the Atomic Energy Commission went out and frequently tested different properties. I was connected with two different companies that I can
think of that had the Atomic Energy Commission come in and actually drill their properties in one case and offer to drill them in another case. The fact
15

 LEON FRAZIER #1
that even the A.E.C. would be interested in testing the properties led to great speculation. You see, it was almost like putting the stamp of approval on the property, when in fact and reality, the A.E.C. was just interested in acquiring information, I'm sure. But they would use this, these people, to show that their properties were better than the rest, "We've got the A.E.C. interested in it." And then, of course, when the A. E. C. started buying up the ores and had a guarantee program, then this resulted in the development of the mill in Moab, I'm sure to process the Steen ores and the other ores in the Moab area. And of course, it had a great effect on the mining companies; Climax, Becklin (?), and many of these large companies then began getting in the milling program because they had a guaranteed market for their product, you see. And there's no question but what it had a legal effect on what was done. Many of the mills were developed and converted, other
mills converted. And then you began getting the larger mining companies interested in it. You had sort of a mini-conglomerate development along back in '58, '59, '60; sort of a "shakeout" in the industry. It was no longer the legal problems of getting the
money for the companies to get the drilling done. It 16

 LEON FRAZIER #1
became a problem of, "We want to get in with the one that's got the contract with the A.E.C. and the one they're buying the ore from," you see. They gave them allotments.
MH: This is when Continental Ores and various other peoples were coming into vogue?
LF: That's right. And then you had the little ones joining the big ones. And you had the large mining companies, the sophisticated mining companies, those that were really in the business of mining started to take a real hard look at the uranium business. And so
you had many of the mining companies that had not been in the mining of uranium start taking an interest in it. That's developing even now with the power companies and with the energy companies. Let's say the major oil companies like Gulf, and Standard, and Humble. These companies now, as we develop new sources of uses, I'll say, for uranium power in submarines and the tremendous demand that's being made for atomic power plants and what the foreseeable program is, you have many of these energy companies that are in the fuel business who are now getting into the mining business real heavily. Gulf and Standard and--oh, Kerr-McGee has been in it in Oklahoma for a long time, but many of the oil
17

 LEON FRAZIER #1
companies now have set up uranium geology departments where before they didn't even have them. They're looking at the whole integrated program from the processing of the ore until they get the refined product, you see.
MH: So this is the near future of the uranium industry, in these large companies?
LF: Well, it seems to be from everything that I've read and from what I see developing in the interest that the bigger companies have in the uranium field.
MH: And then this presents a whole new set of legal problems in dealing with the small miner in regards to a large company?
LF: That's right. They keep getting bigger and the little ones keep getting--
MR: Smaller?
LF: --into the big ones, or they drop by the wayside.
MH: Yeah.
LF: And, of course, we've had the "shell game" developing
here during the past two years, which is a legal problem directly related to this. Because many of these old uranium companies--and I've had at least five of them that were dormant from 19--let's say 1 58 or 159, that have come back now, and although they don't have any uranium properties left, the shell is
18

 LEON FRAZIER #1
there, and the stockholders are there. There is a great scramble for a lot of different companies who are looking for corporate shells and these old uranium shells are a favorite vehicle for many people who feel they can circumvent certain S. E. C.
regulations on registration by acquiring these old shells.
Which companies are these?
MH:
LF: Well, uh, I won't name them specifically, but they're
the old companies that were organized in '56, '57, 58, as uranium mining companies. They either sold their claims to another company or just let their claims go by the board because they didn't do the assessment work on them. Those companies have been reactivated by going into the secretary and state's office and paying the filing fees for the past twelve or fourteen years that have just lapsed and not been paid. Then you reactivate that corporation. Many companies have been pumping new assets into the company, changing the name of it, and you've got a good distribution of stock that has been qualified with the S.E.C. It's free trading stock. So they try to take these companies and in many cases sell the stock after they put the properties of different kinds into it. I mean, not necessarily mining
19

 LEON FRAZIER #1
properties, but motels, and hotels, and chemical companies, and all different types of promotional ventures. And this has been one of the real big problems that have developed. Particularly here in Utah. The commissioner from Securities and Exchange Commission speaking in Salt Lake last week mentioned that this is one of their biggest problems. And it's a problem that I have in the office now because everybody wants to reactivate these old dead mining companies, primarily uranium mining companies. We had so many of them that we handled that have just dropped by the wayside, and it's a fairly easy thing to go in and reactivate these old mining companies, you see?
MH: All they have to do is pay the filing fees for the years--
LF: For the time that they just lapsed, you see.
MH: Are they assessed the hundred dollars for each year that it's supposed to have been worked as well, or--?
LF: Well, no. You see, they don't even have the claims. You don't reactivate the claims, you just reactivate the corporate charter. And people prefer to buy these shells that do not have any assets or any liabilities. They've been sitting there, you see, for
ten to twelve years and they have no liabilities 20

 LEON FRAZIER #1
because the statute of limitations has run against all of the open accounts and the problems that they had, so they're outlawed by the passage of time. The mining claims that they've had, if they were any good, they've been sold or put into companies; the big ones have swallowed them up. If they were no good, they haven't done the assessment work on them,
so they've lost the assessment. So you have a whole group of claim companies in Utah--many, many companies in Utah because this is where we were organizing all the uranium companies; here and over in Colorado primarily. You have those old companies now being resurrected. And the S.E.C. is again having tremendous problems with--this is really a sort of a wave that flows out from the cool of the uranium activity because now, you see, these old uranium companies are being reactivated and names changes. I had a man in here yesterday that had me write the Securities and Exchange Commission for a no-action letter because he had received 236,000 shares of stock in a uranium mining company that the name had been changed on. It has been put back on the market
under an entirely different name, and now the stock has jumped up to seventy-five cents a share. He's a wealthy man. He had just put the stock in a box and
21

 LEON FRAZIER #1
forgotten about it. But now all of a sudden he's the beneficiary of this activity, and so it presents legal problems. And so I'm writing the S.E.C. trying to get a "no-action" letter so he can go ahead and sell his stock, you see.
MH: Isn't this also--doesn't it also present a problem in regard to public land and the domain issue, and the issue of land itself, like if they reactivate and they again have claim to these mining claims that they once had?
LF: Well, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management have gone in and are having a lot of hearing, administrative hearings. They had subpoenaed all the people that had supposed interest in all these properties to terminate those interests. So on a government level, you have a whole series of administrative hearings to cancel out those interests that people have acquired. You have that problem in the shale industry, the oil shale industry, because many of the people went in and located the properties for uranium and that was the mineralization that they found. All of a sudden they find that they have oil shale on the property, so they've also got claims, at least they think they've got claims to the oil shales
and the hydrocarbons. And so you get a mixing of 22

 LEON FRAZIER #1
problems, depending on the mineralization you have.
MH: It's---?--- on mineral rights as well?
LF: That's right. The Rocky Mountain Mineral Institute has conferences each year where they try to reappraise and reevaluate what developing in the field of mining. And if we're talking specifically about uranium mining, I mean, it's still a big subject. It's still a subject that has lots of related problems, legal problems. Well, I think I'm
going to have to see other people if you want to--

 THE FOLLOWING I S AN INTER VIEW WITH LEON F R A Z I E R CONDUCTED B Y M I T C H H A D D A D I N M R . F R A Z I E R ' S O F F I C E I N P R O V O , U T A H ON JULY 30, 1970 FOR THE UTAH-CAL. STATE AT FULLERTON URANIUM INDUSTRY ORAL HISTORY PROJECT. [REEL #2]
MH: Okay, Mr. Frazier, in the previous interview, you felt that there were certain areas that were problems, legally, in regards to the uranium mining industry. Can we go into those a little?
LF: Well, I think I told you that it sort of followed in a cycle. First of all, we have the problems relating to actually the location of the mining claims, and the sorting out of law suits and titles and interests based upon location. This was very early, as I pointed out, along in '53 and '54, and '55. Then the problems started developing with respect to the assessment work on the claims that had been done, and what constituted assessment, and what constituted discovery, and the discovery of mineralization. And then the problems changed to one of raising the funds to exploit the properties. We got into a lot of different forms of financing, regulation of companies
and the use of interstate and intrastate registrations, full registrations with the SEC. Some attempts [were made] to raise capital through limited partnership and different forms of business organization to circumvent the securities laws if possible. And then after the money was raised we had

 LEON FRAZIER #2
a whole series of problems a long in '58 and '59 when the boom, the uranium boom was getting over as far as the companies were concerned. The big companies were coming in and merging and taking over the smaller companies that had any meritorious properties. And so you got a whole series of problems that developed in the business of handling those properties on a day- to-day basis.They've sort of evolved from that time until right up to the present time when we still have a lot of problems relating to the uranium business. The old shells, as I pointed out to you as we were concluding the interview last time, the old shells are being reactivated. We've got at least a half a dozen companies that have been reactivated which for all intents and purposes were dead except they were qualified with the SEC; that is, they had a registration with the SEC and have been reactivated. The breath of corporate life has been breathed back into them, and their names have been changed, recapitalized, and some of them will do well. Some of
them I suppose will be promotional operations. But there are a lot of other areas relating to the uranium industry that I don't have any direct connection with or haven't yet except in conversation with different clients. But they relate to the amount
2

 LEON FRAZIER #2
of radioactivity that the employees can stand and take in these mines where they are working for people and working conditions have been imposed in underground uranium mining areas. We've got the problems we mentioned before: pollution and radioactivity. This has been a big problem for the Hughes organization in the Vegas area and for a lot
of people that are in southern Utah that are in the cattle business and have homes in those areas. So you still have a lot of problems relating to the uranium industry.
MH: Now then basically the mining law which is in effect here--well, the federal law which is in effect, wasn't it started in 1866, and then clarified in 1870, and more or less complied in 1872? And that's still the basic law which is the mining law for the United States of America.
LF: That's right.
MH: Now doesn't this present problems in its
administration due to the fact that there are several areas where there might be a little bit of gapping within the--?
LF: Well, I haven't found there are too many gaps in it as such. I think that the mining law has been expanded and interpreted by court decisions, and by
3

 LEON FRAZIER #2
additional legislation under the Multiple Use Acts. So there has been greater clarifications, and there are some areas that are going to have to be further clarified by court decisions or by administrative rulings and court decisions, particularly in the oil shale industry, and hydrocarbons, and some of these old claims that were filed way back, but there weren't any real serious problems that I could find. There were a lot of court decisions as to whether there was really mineralization. And usually cases went on whether there was enough uranium in the ore to make it commercially profitable for them to mine it and ship it. And that was determined by reference of how far the claims were from the buying station and what the hauling costs were. We had some where we went in and there was definite mineralization. There was definite mineralization. There was no question about it. There were trace elements and the court found that there was not sufficient mineralization. There were others where we found there was sufficient
mineralization where it was low grade, but there were large bodies of it. It would have been possible to put in an upgrading mill or even to have hauled it to a grading mill. Those things are interpretations of the law based upon court decisions. And actually
4

 LEON FRAZIER #2
mining law itself basically a good law, I think. I can't see that you could make too many changes in it. The changes have already been made really by
administrative decision and by court decisions, and so the law has been interpreted--it's a little bit like the Constitution. You can't say that the Constitutions isn't a good law, but we've had to make some amendments to it. The old mining law has had t o be amended by court decisions, in effect, or at least interpreted by court decisions and administrative decisions, but basically it's still a good law in my opinion.
MH: While it's subject to another change right now before the Public Land Law Review Commission.
LF: That's right.
MH: Given several recommendations. Now is this just a
further step then in adjusting toward technology?
LF: I think so. It's a little like the Wheat Report. The
Securities and Exchange Commission before them recommendation from Wheat who is one of the member of the commission and very knowledgeable. He made a very extensive survey and research to bring the Securities and Exchange laws up to date to conform to modern practices and the needs of the other brokers and securities industry. The Wheat Report has taken the
5

 LEON FRAZIER #2
old Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations and made a lot of recommendations as to how it might be changed. But basically the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations are good but subject to some modification and amendments.and made a lot of recommendations as to how it might be changed. And I would say the old
mining laws are in much the same position. If we go back and start trying to change it too basically, I think you're going to have a lot of real serious problems. The M ultiple Use A ct and the interpretations of what you actually have under these old mining locations, those things have been pretty well decided by court decision.
MH: There has been quite an amount of litigation and also, well, litigation in many areas in regards to the mining laws. In the courts here in Utah there's--
LF: Oh, particularly here in the West. You got here and in Arizona, and New Mexico, and in Colorado. In the four-state area of Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado you have basically all of the uranium cases in this section of the land. You've probably got as
many cases in the federal district courts in Utah as we did in any of them.
6

 LEON FRAZIER #2
MH: Aren't the judges that are in these districts quite
knowledgeable in the field? I mean, they ' ve handled
so many of them that it seems like--
LF: Oh, they are. No question about it. Judge Christensen
is an excellent judge. He just came out of Utah County, practiced law here in Provo, and was appointed to the federal bench about the time--I think it was in '54 or '55 when Judge Christensen was appointed to the bench, right at the height of the uranium boom. And he had done a lot of work in this field and was very knowledgeable and is very knowledgeable. He's an excellent judge. Judge Ritter has a lot of practical experience in this field and has done a lot on law. He's had a lot to do with the development of the gypsum interest down at
---?---. I noticed yesterday where he filed an action as a private citizen involving some land up in the Snake River, one of the rivers up near his land in Idaho. Judge Ritter is very knowledgeable in mining law too. Both judges have had a lot of cases before them, big cases. Judge Ritter has had a couple cases here that were offshoots of the Texas-Gulf Sulphur Case. And he's made some rather far-reaching decisions. It's yet to be seen whether they'11 be held up by the Supreme Court of the United States or
7

 LEON FRAZIER #2
not because they're in direct opposition to some of the other federal cases that have been decided in New York. The same type of problem: disclosure as to what you've got. In the Texas-Gulf Sulphur Case where they had the strike up in Timmons, Ritter has held differently than a federal court in the East where there is an almost identical fact situation.
MH: So this maybe could account for the--it seems that here in the Colorado Plateau mining law and the laws regarding the uranium industry are much more understood, not only among the lawyers, but even--
LF: Oh, I think this is true because here we have people who are working in the field all the time, and as I think of my friend and clients and associates that I represent--I represent the people who were out staking mining claims. I'm talking about people who had the equipment, went out to work in the uranium mines, and who themselves went down and developed properties and shipped [ore]. We had a buying mill in Salt Lake, we had a mine station at---?--- and Grand
Junction and Moab, and down in White Canyon and down at Mexican Hat. And so we're in the middle of the business here because our clients are dealing in that type of operation. At least my clients are. Some attorneys didn't handle a lot of this mining law, but
8

 LEON FRAZIER #2
it tied in really with real property law. I'd sort of specialized in real estate and real property law, and corporation law after I had finished my work with Howard Hughes, and so it was only natural that two of those fields that I've had experience in should attract people who are having problems in uranium claims which is a real property problem. And, of
course, the organization of companies is related to corporation organization in the raising of finances and so forth. And you get back into Kansas or Missouri or New York where they don't have any uranium deposits or known deposits, naturally you don't have any uranium deposits or known deposits, naturally you don't have people that would have that kind of problem. And the attorneys would handle those problems. We probably handle more regulation on mining companies and, of course, the SEC applies different rules to mining companies than they do to, let's say, life insurance companies that are just starting up or any other type of business activity where you don't have that kind of speculation, and you don't have the geological reports, and you don't have the problem of title to the claims. So those of us who practice in the uranium mining field have a lot of problems that lawyers outs~de generally of the
9

 LEON FRAZIER #2
four-state area wouldn't even handle. They wouldn't even be conversant in it unless they read some of these fields and maybe got into it indirectly through mining activities. In Idaho, for instance, you didn't have any uranium mining problems, but you had a tremendous number of silver mining problems up in the Coeur d'Alene D istrict. And while they're not dissimilar fields, there is a difference. It's not a
big basic difference, but we handle a lot of cases in the federal courts and the state courts that dealt specifically with the uranium mining problems, you see. What I mentioned before, the problem initially of whether it is a placer location you ought to be putting on or a lode location that you ought to be putting on, or should we protect ourselves and put both on, you see? A lot of these things were peculiar to the uranium mining industry.
MH: This conflict over whether it should be placer or lode brings to mind a question which I guess was one that most of the courts settled. Now a placer claim has a large area and when you start setting your
maximum amount of placer claims, you can have actually a larger area than you do with subsequent lode claims. Am I correct in this?
LF: They cover more ground. In bigger claims-- 10

 LEON FRAZIER #2
MH: This is something that went to the courts didn't it? LF: Right. You bet. You get over into Wyoming, in
southern Wyoming where you have the Lander and Utah Construction Company pits, or you get down to Moab, and that's a placer location because it's spread out all over the country. I mean not in the San Rafel Swell--just more or less a placer location type deposit. The Shinarump and the Chinle formations that the uranium was found in were strictly placer type locations because the bed deposits were over a wide area. Now you get over by Marysville where you get over into the pitchblend and that's strictly in a vein. I mean the black ore is in a vein just 1ike silver or gold that's in a vein. You'll find it in a vein, and so in the Marysville area it's strictly lode locations. Or if you even got down on the plateau in some of the areas where you are into the Morrison Formation and you have the pockets and pods and you didn't have any big bedding deposits, a lot of them took the position that they ought to be protected by a lode claim because it was ore in place not spread out. So in the Morrison Formation where there was ore found, usually you'd find them putting on a lode location. If it was the big Morrison Formation and a big amount of Morrison was showing,
11

 LEON FRAZIER #2
then they'd usually go ahead and float a lode location on it where they found it and also cover the whole area with a placer location even though the Morrison Formation ore was a---?--- type ore which was usually in pockets and pots and lances. Carbonaceous material that would be a real high grade ore would usually be in the beds of rivers or where the trash was deposited, and you'd have just maybe a bunch of hot spots and that's all. And then you get into the Morrison--! mean the Shinarump and the--
MH: --Chinle.
LF: Chinle. And you'd get it bedded out and spread out
and try to do that with placers and to try to protest
themselves.
MH: Uh huh. And this was something that was taken to the
courts? LF: Right.
MH: They had to interpret this, right?
LF: Anybody in a lot of geological data will show the
type of deposit it was and how it was formed and how much mineralization it took to give a reading on a geiger counter or scintillometer, or you could chemically test it with the various chemicals and so forth.
MH: So what eventually evolved out of the courts? As the 12

 LEON FRAZIER #2
interpretation stands today, t hey ' re basically considered lode claims then, r i ght?
LF: Unless you get into an area over l ike Wyoming where they're open-pitting it over a wide area; then they suggest that you cover it with placer locations . If I were advising a client and there was any question, I'd put a lode location in where he found the outcropping and where he knew he definitely had it,
and then protect himself by throwing a placer in on
top of it if there was any questions about it.
MH: The advising of people on how to claim seems to be one of the largest legal functions of the mining lawyers. I mean, that seems to be what a lot of people do when they come to you with, "Well, how do I
do this?"
LF: That's right. I do have a lot of people come in and
say, "I think I have something. How do you suggest I protect myself?" And they don't want to tel1 you where it is and you say, "Well, I've got to know whether it's in Utah or whether it's in Nevada or Colorado because in addition to the federal requirements that you have, you have got to known what the state requirements are so that you can
protect yourself and you can do the annual assessment work the way it's required. Kill two birds with one
13

 LEON FRAZIER #2
stone." So you have to advise what to do in Utah and what they don't practice law in those other states, and we have to know enough about it so we can tell them they'd better do this to protect themselves in another state. And if there's any real serious legal question to get in touch with an attorney in New Mexico or Arizona or wherever it is.
MH: This brings to mind a question that a lot of the people who are concerned with the mining, the uranium prospectors, you know, miners, the corporation head-- well, are they leery, say, of the lawyer? It's an area where basically even a prospector doesn't know too much about the law regarding uranium mining, does he?
LF: Well, I think that most people are leery of lawyers that are not really used to using lawyers. People who have problems--and there have been a lot of stories told in different areas, I'm sure, about the attorneys and so forth--but I think basically people who have legal problems are leery of lawyers whether they' re in the mining business, or they 've got a divorce, or whether they got any kind of a patented idea that they think somebody may take advantage of. I don't think there's any more leeriness on the part
of people who have discovered mining claims than 14

 LEON FRAZIER #2
there are people who discovered something that they think is a good patentable idea really. At least my experience hasn't been that way. It depends on the
sophistication of the client that you're talking to. If you've got a man who's a knowledgeable business man and he's a part of an organization that's located some claims, he'll go immediately to seek the advice of an attorney without any suspicions. And you get some farmer or some ne'er-do-well who thinks that he's really hit it and he's never owned anything in his life and never had any contact with attorneys, he's suspicious of everybody. And it doesn't matter whether it's an attorney or whether it's the guy down at the local tavern that he beds an elbow with every day. He's suspicious of everybody because he thinks he's found the mother lode, you see.
MH: This brings to mind one of the problems areas of mining, and that is the actual ownership of your property or the struggle over property ownership. This has been dealt with several ways legally. I mean the people like the unpatented versus patented mining claim. Now this is an area where many people seek to protect themselves.
LF: Well, of course, my advice to them is if they have done the work on it and they want the added
15

 LEON FRAZIER #2
protection of having no question about, or at least having less questions about who owns property, have
it surveyed and if you've worked and can qualify, go ahead and have it patented. It's more to deal, I think, with mining companies patented claims, of course, than it is on unpatented claims. Although many of the companies are taking unpatented claims, and in order to acquire title, go out and buy claims
from three or four different groups that are staked in the same area. We've had this in connection with some clients that I represent on the beryllium claims down by---?--- not uranium. But Bausch(?) Beryllium has gone in and has actually bought the same claims essentially or the same ground from two and sometimes three different groups.
MH: Aren't there several problems in regards to getting patents? I mean problems in dealing with the Department of Interior, their attitude more or less?
LF: I haven't had any patent problems recently so I really don't know how difficult or easy it is to get a patent. It's been ten years since I had to worry about helping someone get a patent on a claim.
MH: How easy was it then?
LF: It wasn't difficult. Pretty easy if you met the
required discovery and your claims are in order and 16

 LEON FRAZIER #2
you performed the annual assessment work as required. It was not too difficult. But I understand from what I've read and from what I've heard that it is getting more difficult. But I can't say firsthand. I don't know.
MH: This bears out the question of the part of the government that, you know, the Bureau of Land Management, the Atomic Energy Commission, and other governmental agencies which have acted in the field of uranium mining, which actually in essence can control it. Doesn't this legally present a problem?
LF: Well, it's presented a lot of problems in that they have gone in, different governmental agencies, and particularly the Bureau of Land Management and attempted to clean up areas where a lot of claims were put on and pits dug and discovery work and so forth without any discovery of mineralization. And the geology is so obviously non-uranium bearing that they¥ve gone on and have had to clean up the old claims because people claim mineralization and they were staking claims out in the cow pasture or what have been beautiful stands of timber where they could
get good summer cabin sites, and this is a problems that is even prevalent with any kind of mining claim location. The government has gone in through the
17

 LEON FRAZIER #2
various agencies and tried to clear up a lot of these old mining interests and tried to get them out of the
forest and the national parks and the national monuments, areas where they shouldn't have been in the first place because a lot of people in the uranium industry and in other industries have been making other claims. They've gone in and tried to get property for summer homesites and not really for the value of the mining. This has been a continuing problem to the governmental agencies, and I guess it always w ill be.
MH: So then it's contingent then as a problem of conservation as well.
LF: Oh surely. I was out to Geneva Steel Company this morning looking at a film of their operations, their mining operations over at Atlantic City over at South Pass. They're concerned with open-pit mining in a way that they won't destroy all the landscape, and so they leave stands of timber in through and around their property so that the elk and the deer and the wildlife can survive. You get a lot of claims that you see it out through Mormon Mesa, just going out toward Las Vegas where every three hundred feet there's a great big gouge. Every fifteen hundred feet in the terrain for miles and miles there's supposed
18

 LEON FRAZIER #2
to be the work that was done to qualify for the state assessment work on claims. The cattlemen got unhappy about that. I don't blame them because their cattle would fall down in those pits and they were just
never ever attended. They were never anything other than just a sham to show somebody that they had done work on the property. They never had any mineralization of any kind, no property---?---. So the government has a responsibility and they're going in and cleaning up these messes. The cattlemen complain to them that they have to go in and clear off these old mining claims. They file affidavits for assessment work. Many people where assessment work has never been done on the property but, you know, they go out and stick a few sticks of dynamite in the ground and blow them off, or run the bulldozer over it and make a needless road, you know. And the government has the problem conservation-wise, as you mentioned, of keeping these stuff as cleaned up as they can. We probably had the face of the four-state area, including Nevada and Wyoming, scarred more with the uranium mining speculation and just gouging out than any other type of mining operation. In the old days, the miners used to have their "glory holes" where they'd go in and work for discoveries, but in
19

 LEON FRAZIER #2
no other mining that I know of have they gone in on the scale that the uranium miners did and marked off pits for miles and miles where you scarred the landscape and had nothing except uranium fever, you see, when you did it.
MH: You mentioned that various states have certain requirements, like Nevada where this example is common. Well, Utah also has certain special requirements on the miners, the assessment work.
LF: Right.
MH: Okay now. The tax commission was recently--well, not
so recently, but at a period that the tax commission was brought and was asked, or told, or they attempted to clear this up. When you have a claim, you're assessed one year's work, which is a hundred dollars' work, but you're automatically assessed two more years, if I'm not mistaken. So eventually they had to clean that up. Now wouldn't that present a problem to a lot of these miners who really did not do the assessment work, or two, didn't have enough money to do the assessment work, or three, I guess, didn't
want to pay it?
LF: Well, actually it was a question about whether they
could charge in advance of the time that they actually did the work. Of course, when you first get
20

 LEON FRAZIER #2
an unpatented claim, you record your assessment work by filing your affidavit of assessment work in the county recorder's office in each of the counties where the claims are located. And, of course, if the claims are continuous, all of them, you can do the work on one claim and claim it for all of the claims
if they're continuous. So you may do the work in Utah County, but part of the claims are over into Juab County, the next county over south. If you've done work in Utah County, you file in Utah County and in Juab County. And this is one of the problems you have to help people with on their assessment work, on the affidavit, and you do that on any kind of mining. It's no different from uranium, it's no different than silver, it's no different than gold. If you get your claim patented, then, of course, it goes on the tax rolls and you pay taxes on it instead of your annual assessment work. We have tremendous numbers of claims now that there patented back during the uranium boom when people had been paying the real property taxes on it. And so they come up for sale now after they've gone delinquent for four years in Utah. They'll sell them on the fifth year, you see, at public tax sales. But they do the same thing with other mining claims that haven't had their tax
21

 LEON FRAZIER #2
assessment paid on, you see, normally the tax assessment of a mining claim, after it's been put on the tax rolls, is substantially less than a hundred dollars' worth of work you had to do to qualify before it's put on the tax rolls, that is, after it's patented. But we're starting to get quite a few of those that are being sold. In fact, this year at the tax sales throughout the state, we bought a number of patented mining claims that were put back on the market because the taxes hadn't been paid on them. It's simply a window dressing for some companies who are going to go on a public stock offering. The SEC and others seem to put more weight on patented claims than they do on unpatented claims. These people may be just using them as window dressing, see, just to say, "Well, look, we've got some patented claims," as though patented claims give you a mark of respectabi1ity. And you yel1, "Yeah, we've got ore, you see. We've got a patented claim." And that's not necessarily so.
MH: So it's the securities game all over again then?
LF: That's right. It surely is.
MH: Is this done a lot by promoters as well as by actual
large companies?
LF: Well, yes, I think that a lot of it's promotion. A
22

 LEON FRAZIER #2
lot of them are changing the names of these mining companies and putting a lot of different types of companies into the housing business, the building business, different kinds of commercial enterprises-- chemical companies. We've had one that's gone into a
chemical, and one that's gone into a real estate company, one that's gone into a computer company, one that's gone into an electronics company, one that's gone into automotive parts company, one that's gone into a rest home company, one that's gone into a fast food franchising setup. So these old uranium m~ning companies are being revamped and reactivated and recapitalized and restructured and put into a variety of things.
MH: This, too, brings to mind another question now. From my understanding, about 70 percent of the land actually in Utah is public domain, land owned by the federal government.
LF: I think that's pretty close to true. I've got some maps in there that show what's government and what's state and what's patented land.
MH: What I'm getting at is the assets for Utah are considerably less than they could be then as a result of the government owning so much land in the state?
LF: Well, what do you mean by that, that the assets are 23

 LEON FRAZIER #2 so much--
MH: Well, the taxable--
LF: Oh, that would be true. Once the state owns it or
once it's patented, the--
MH: Yeah, or once an individual owns it, right?
LF: Once an individual gets a patent on it, it goes on
the tax roll, and, of course, obviously is greater as far as the states are concerned. They get the tax rate.
MH: Uh huh. So I wonder, have they made moves to try to make these lands, you know, available for their tax rolls, you know, to try to--
LF: Well, there's hasn't been any great movement in that direction recently. I take the magazine out of the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of the Interior called Our Public Lands. It comes out monthly, and I believe it lists the lands that are being offered for sale by the government. And we don't have a lot of land being offered for sale; or as they get it surveyed in the few areas that are not surveyed, then we have a stake here, school sections,
and the federal government may make some trades with them. Where the government could take larger blocs and if for some reason the state wants it, they may trade, and the state may get other land. But there
24

 LEON FRAZIER #2
hasn't been any great movement to open it up to homesteading or anything like that if that's what you had reference to.
MH:
I'm wondering, too, the fall of the large corporation in uranium mining has definitely been an important--! mean this has probably been what many of the
attorneys represent most of, are the corporations.
LF: Wel1, I'm sure this is true and, of course, oh, I could name quite a number. I don't like to deal in
personalities particularly, but Rich Melich was Charlie Steen's personal attorney, and he went on to become the president of the Uranium Reduction Company, which was the big milling that milled the ore after Atlas corporation came in. He was the president there. And then Rich Melich has gone back to Washington now as an assistant. In fact, I think he is the Solicitor General for the Department of Interior. Mitch started his practice down in Moab and has been an excellent attorney, and grew up in a uranium mining business along with Charly Steen. Mitch has done a great job. And some of the other attorneys--Senior and Senior in Salt Lake has sort of specialized in mining law, and they've handled lots of mining cases. And there are lo ts of other attorneys locally here--Leland Morgan handled quite a
25

 LEON FRAZIER #2
bit of work because he also had some properties in the Moab area, and they've leased property to the major mining companies. Attorneys who took an interest in investing got into it just because they wanted to find out how their investment was being taken care of. There was an attorney here in Provo, Joe H. ---?--- who handled a few mining companies and did some work. He's since retired and left the area, but the attorneys who are interested in that type of work usually invested in the companies and took stock
in them and participated.
MH: So they could have lost just as much as anybody else,
huh?
LF: That's right. And many of us did.
MH: I have a question, too, also for the attorneys. You
could probably answer this, working for Howard Hughes, too. When you work for a large corporation, I mean, a multi-million dollar operation or a sizable type of operation, what are the main legal problems in mining that come about for that corporation?
LF: Well, of course, I've never worked for a large mining corporation, and it's only been recently that Hughes came to Nevada--since I left the organization--that Hughes has gotten into the mining business. So really I don't feel I'm qualified to say what the problems
26

 LEON FRAZIER #2
are in a large mining company because I don't represent and I have never represented any large mining companies. I represent a lot of small mining companies, and I've represented corporations, but I don't represent any large mining corporations. You ought to speak to somebody that represents Kennecott or one of the coal companies down in Carbon County or one of the large companies up in Park City or out in Eureka or something. I haven't represented any large--what I would consider large mining companies.
MH: Uh huh. Well, the problems of small miners, you know, when he has to go to legal action, what is the difference between his problems versus the large company?
LF: Well, the small mining company's problems are, of course, varied according to whatever activity they're in. It usually covers the whole spectrum, so that you handle everything from the location of the claim to, oh, raising your capital. You cover the whole spectrum of mining problems when you represent small mining companies.
MH: Well, during the boom wasn't there quite a bit of conflict between the small mining companies and the larger companies over what prices should be paid for ore?
27

 LEON FRAZIER #2
LF: Oh no, prices were not a problem. There were a lot of
problems in connection with the location of claims; a lot of the big companies came in and tried to bulldoze the little guy out, just like they would recently with the beryllium claims down in Juab County and Millard. You have the big mining companies coming in with their drills and drilling on the property and posting armed guards. The little old miners, they were practically scared off the property. Those that stayed and stood up and fought for their rights really made a lot of money, a lot of money. This was the same problem down on the plateau; just because a company is big doesn't necessarily mean that it's right. And in the early stages there were a lot of these large mining companies that were coming into it that tried to bulldoze a lot of these young, upstart companies out of the way. You have a lot of problems developing between the smaller and the large companies, but usually the courts could sort out the wheat from the chaff, and the small mining companies if they had something really good would get their day in court and get their just fruits. And then the big mining companies, if they found they had been beaten on legal grounds by the smaller companies or individuals actually owned the
28

 LEON FRAZIER #2
properties, then they would make a deal to pick them up if they wanted it bad enough. The big ones kept getting bigger. Sometimes the 1ittle guy who would
hit a marginal operation, a marginal uranium mine and couldn't work it would go to the big companies and offer to sell it to them for little or nothing just to get their money out of it. So the big companies that had the good exploration crews and the financial backing to survive, survived and took over the claims. Climax Uranium has closed down the mill at Grand Junction, but they're still very much in the mining business, very much in the uranium mining business. And I'm sure when economic conditions are such they' 11 reopen their properties. They' re not backing out of these properties, but the big companies I think are a little more selective than the small promotional companies, but it really depends upon the situation. Now you've got lots of larger, as I mentioned before, energy companies, the oil and the gas companies taking a long look at the uranium mining business, and some of them are getting into it pretty heavily.
MH: Well, now when you mentioned that large companies have gone into this and are active, but I've noticed that today in order for your claims to be worthwhile,
29

 LEON FRAZIER #2
some of them have to be very deep. For example, Rio Algom has just entered this aspect of uranium mining, and they're going for a shaft that's almost three thousand feet long.
LF: Of course, they haven't just entered the mining field. They've been in the mining--uranium business in Canada for years. But they did come down and pick up the Humeca properties from Jim Hudson and Eldon Card.
MH: And Daniel Meyers.
LF: Dan Meyers. And they're down three thousand feet, but
of course, they went in and drilled it all and blocked it up, and they know what they've got before they go down and start mining it--just like Texas- Gulf Sulphur did down at Moab on their sulphur properties. So the big companies have the money to go in and drill it out and find it, and if it's there and in large enough quantities, they've got the financial backing to go in and sink the shafts after they find it.
MH: This leads to the question I have in regard to the mining law. Well, originally the 1872 mining law was a descendant of a Spanish mining law and was originally set up to protect the small miner, and it has proceeded on through. In essence, does it still
30

 LEON FRAZIER #2
protect him, or you know, have these big companies, because of their money, been able to go around it?
LF: Well, I think the small miner can be protected if he follows the law and has good advice in the location of his claims. I don't think he necessarily has to have a lot of money to hold onto these claims, but I think there are certain distinct advantages in being a big company and having a lot of money. You go in and determine the extent of your ore body, and once you think you've got a discovery on the claim, you see, I don't know what more can be done to protect the small miner than what we have on the mining laws now. There have either been some recommendations made that I am not aware of, but I think I can advise my clients and have them operate within the present mining law and the law as modified by the court decisions to the point that I think I can protect them against the big mining companies if they'll follow along and do what they're supposed to.
MH: Well, basically, it seems like the largest question comes over claiming of---?---
LF: That's right.
MH: Your aspect there. I mean, the Public Land Law Review
Commission has offered something also. I guess they've offered a system similar to that which is in
31

 LEON FRAZIER #2
Canada so that the government knows exactly what areas are free and what areas are vacant. They have them on a large map and it's available, or something
like that, but apparently now anybody as long as they're on an unpatented mining claim, if their claim is shaky in any way at all, it can be usurped off that claim.
LF: One of the things that I think would be helpful, although it would hurt the small miner, would be to require them to tie it into township range and section corners. Because during the uranium boom and even now we have a lot of what we call floating claims and even though you tie it into natural monuments and natural objects on the property, if you get in particular areas, there may be more than one set of circumstances that would cover the same location, you see. You might float a claim as much as four or five miles in any direction if you could find a big rock to tie it to or a tree adjacent to a stream bed or some other natural monument that would satisfy the mining law. Now you only have to do it,
have your survey only if you're going to patent it. It would be very helpful to the recorder and to those of us who have to go in and check the mining law, that instead of checking out a notice of location,
32

 LEON FRAZIER #2
have it by township range and section, and make it like any other documents, so that you can't record it unless you've got it tied into the township range and
section. I would say, if I were going to make a recommendation, that in addition to the notice of location, you require them to put on the notice of location exactly how the claims are put in and how they tie into each other. Now we try to do that, and I advise my clients to actually make a map of the area. We have nothing to hide, you see. And the law-- it used to be that you tried to keep all your tricks
in your bag until you got to court. But under the new federal laws and under the new state procedures, we have our depositions, and we have our interrogatories, and our pretrial conferences; we try to find out everything about our opponent's case and they're entitled to know everything about our case before we get into court. So it isn't a game of surprises, you see. This has led to lots of settlements before you ever get into the actual trial of the case and start taking up the time of the court and the jury, you see, because you do tell them everything you know before you get into court. Now if the mining laws could adopt that philosophy so that on the back of your claims locations you had a map
33

 LEON FRAZIER #2
that shows where it tied into a township range and section--you actually tie it down to a corner, then you tie it down with a map on the back, and if you've got a half a dozen claims or a dozen or two dozen claims, you know how each claim lies in respect to each other. Or even make them tie them in with a compass so that you know the direction that the lines run, you see. Boy, this would stop a lot of litigation and you'd get out of this old problem of where are they, even when you find the claim location papers in the courthouse. Now the way it is, you can
file a claim location and lots of times you still can't tell where they're at. They're five miles southwest of Millford in the Starr Range. Well, that get to be a broad area, you know. Or two miles west of the junction or road or something like that, you know. There just ought to be more of a tie down in my opinion. But there again, you see, you may penalize the small miner who can't afford to pay $50, or $100, or $150, or $200 to have his claim staked out by a surveyor or something, you see.
MH: This is another question in regards to how certain things can legally go contradictory to--like the conflict over the apex or over the extralateral rights regarding a claim. Now this is something that,
34

 LEON FRAZIER #2
I guess, is like an exception to the law, isn't it?
LF: That's right.
MH: Now, on extralateral rights, they don't have any
stipulations as to how far they can follow a vein, do
they?
LF: No, except that if there's a known claim, you can't
MH:
go onto that known claim. This is part of the problem, see, because you never know what the boundary lines of one claim take up with another one until you have a quiet title action to actually go out and have it surveyed. And you get into a dispute on mining claims over ore, a valuable ore body, and eventually you have to have them claimed anyway or
surveyed anyway to see where those lines are at. And this would solve a lot of problems if you could have them surveyed in the first instance and tied in--not necessarily surveyed but at least tied in by township range and section.
Giving the impression that many of the prospectors or miners are reluctant to have their claims surveyed.
Y es.
They don't want to take the time?
LF:
MH:
LF: Or the cost is a problem. Not necessarily the time
but the money of getting a surveying out there. Some of them are in a rather remote area. And in addition
35

 LEON FRAZIER #2
to the cost of the survey, it probably also has some per diems and travel time in getting them down there, you see. They may have difficulty in finding the section markers and so forth.
MH: A final question, and that's in regard to the numerous cases that have come before Utah or at least before the federal judges in this particular district. I mean there's been a long history of both cases on a federal level as well as, I'm sure, cases on a state level, if they would bring them. I don't know, probably the smaller cases maybe. But it seems
like the miners often went to courts rather than going to violence, except in the few instances that you did mention of where they really did have armed guards, and shotguns, and all that.
LF: Wel1, we had both. We had those who resorted to violence and those who preferred to deal in the courts, and it depends on the nature of the individual you're dealing with. There's a fellow in Moab by the name of Dan Duryea who had a reputation for--we bought some claims from him and found that some of these same claims had also been sold to some other people, and he had some serious accusations
made against him. Got a lot of different people mad at him. And one night somebody just honked their horn
36

 LEON FRAZIER #2
and he walked out of his trailer into some lights and somebody shot him with a rifle and that was all. I mean, they never did find out who it was, but he had a reputation generally in the mining business of double-selling the claims. There were a lot of people that were upset with him. But most people took their grievances to court. We had our share of cases in Utah and the federal courts, and still do.
MH: LF: MH:
LF:
Yeah. This is--there's quite a--
It isn't over yet.
I know in the state there's still a lot of litigation today dealing with the claims. Now are these appeals that are just finally coming back or--?
No, they're new claims, most of them. At least the ones we're handling. We don't have too many old cases. We're having a lot of problems come in in connection with the old mining companies, you know. The reorganization, recapitalization, restructuring of these old shells. But we aren't having a lot of litigations in the office at all dealing with the old mining claims.
It's all basically then new ones?
Right. It's all new locations.
Is there anything else you'd like to add in areas of
mining law or legal aspects of uranium industry that 37
MH: LF: MH:

 LEON FRAZIER #2
haven't been touched on? Important areas that I could have missed?
LF: No, I think we've pretty well covered it unless you have some specific questions which you'd like to know about. It's a little difficult to know exactly what you want or what you'd like, but I'd be glad to help you anyway I can. But I can only give you the benefit of my experience. I'm probably not the most
knowledgeable attorney in the state. I'm sure there
are many others that have handled as many or more.
MH: Well, basically, it seems like you get certain point of views. Now you have your point of view over the patent and the unpatented mining claim and this whole thing of the Department of the Interior, and Coleman versus the Supreme Court of the United States where they applied this marketability test. Now this is one area that I'm more concerned with what happens to the small miner. I mean, it seems like he's been
completely phased out legally. I mean, not so much that the laws are against him, but there's really not that much room for the small miner.
LF: Well, I think that this is true of all fields of endeavor. The small miner is no different than the small farmer. The small farmer can't make it because if the cost of doing business, really. So he has to
38

 LEON FRAZIER #2
keep getting a larger farm and a larger farm to produce an income to make any money. Smal1 miners used to be able to go in and do the work themselves, and if they could make ten or fifteen dollars a day, boy, that was big money to them. That no longer is true. You get to a point where the small miner, if he's going to put electricity into it, he's going to
MH: LF:
have to pay the electrician $6.20 an hour to come and put the power in, and he's going to have to get all of these craftsmen to come out, and that's going to cost him a fortune. And the miners can make--I don't know what the going scale is, but it's substantially more than it was even back in 1951 to '57 during the uranium boom there. So it costs the small man so much more money to get into the business now, you see. Trucks cost more, dynamite costs more.
It's not even worth it then?
The equipment costs more, and so the price of the ore is not substantially increased. In fact, you get about the same as you did before out of it, but once you've got a very profitable operation, you can't afford to sell it, you see. You can't afford to mine
anymore because of the cost. It's not the big companies fault. It's just that unless you've got a big operation and a big amount of capital to put into
39

 LEON FRAZIER #2
it, you can't make a fair return on your investment. The small miner is better off with the wages the way they are to go to work for a big mining company. This is what has happened. The small miners have gone to
work for the big mining companies. And even some of the big mining companies, if they get small deposits of ore, it works conversely. They find that they can't afford to go in and mine out the small bodies, so they'11 lease it out to the small independent miner who'll take it on a lease basis as many of them are doing up in Park City. Not uranium, but I mean they're doing this also down on the plateau. I have a fellow that I talked to the other day that had a mining operation going and said, "I just can't afford to have to run it anymore." And they're not a big mining company, but he said, "We decided to lease it out to a couple of guys and let them run it themselves." It's economics; it's not an attempt on anybody's part that I can see to get the small miner out of the business.
MH: It's just economics?
LF: Economics just makes it so that it's just a good
business to be in if you're a small miner. MH: In fact, it's macroeconomics basically.
LF: Sure.
40

 LEON FRAZIER #2
MH: The overall economy and the effect of it. Not micro,
it's not just one individual incident.
LF: Right. That's the trend.
MH: It's the whole thing. Then most of the litigation
today is large companies or a company versus a company over claim type things. Or a company versus an individual then, right?
LF: That's right. That seems to be the case.
MH: It's actions that are brought against--you know, it's kind of like in acquiring so their---?--- can run,
and they have to get certain people out of the way. LF: That's right. It's the nature of the quiet title
action.
MH: Now the actual--let me express my naivete here. The
actual definition then of a quiet title act is an attempt at a settlement out of court primarily over a title.
LF: Right.
MH: I mean, you're acting as the--
LF: Well, it doesn't necessarily have to be out of court.
In fact, what we do is usually always file an action in the court, immediately file what we call a les pendens (?) against the property. It's the Latin meaning a notice pending. We file this les pendens
(?) against that property so that everybody is on 41

 LEON FRAZIER #2
notice that there's problems in connection with that property. And if you're going to deal with it, you'd better deal with it subject to the complaint that we filed in court that says that our man has a claim to
it, you see.
MH: So you get a hearing date upon this likelihood.
LF: So we immediately are able to put something on notice
as record that there are people claiming an interest in that property. And if you proceed to deal with that property on a lease or sale basis, you do it at your own peril because our client has an interest as set forth in his complaint. He claims he was the first one and that he's the one that made the discovery, that he's the one that's done the
assessment work or whatever the problem is, you see. MH: So then I can see how the corporations now that they would come in--I guess it's just a question relating back to the anti-trust cases, you know, where the corporations kind of got a bad image as a result of the mining. Now they're actually needed. I mean,
they're essential, I guess.
LF: Well, they're certainly getting into it. And they're
getting into it because I think they can see an opportunity to make a return on their investment. And the larger the package, the larger the company that
42

 LEON FRAZIER #2
it will take to handle it, you see.
MH: So it gets back then to what you said that actually a lawyer today who handles mining actions is actually handling property titles, titles, estates, and title estates rather than actual violations of the mining statutes?
LF: That's right.
MH: So this is kind of a key area then in mining laws?
LF: It certainly is. It's usually the first thing you
have to decide. You¥ve got to decide that question before you start taking ore out of the ground. These companies won't go and spend million of dollars for development, and stripping of ---?--- and drilling and these other things unless they know who owns the property. So that's the first thing you've got to do. Then when you decide who's got the property, then the large mining companies usually have their large legal staffs on a retainer basis or have their legal staffs. I don't know what the trend is or which way it's going to go particularly because my practice is not exclusively mining law. But I can't see any big changes in it. Are you talking about just uranium
mining?
MH: No, I think when you talk about this, you have to
talk about mining law in general. I mean, gas and oil 43

 LEON FRAZIER #2
and water comes into it as well, doesn't it? I mean, the water right especially in the western United States?
LF: Well, I'll tell you one thing that I think they're going to add that is the concept that I haven't even read anything about, but I got to thinking about it this morning after this film I saw out at Geneva Steel Company. It may be that the mining law of the
future ought to have it in some definite provisions for protection of the ecology. Well, some of them adopted it during the uranium boom. They found it
wasn't necessary to dig all these pits, and so they'd maybe drill two-inch drill holes instead of a fifteen-by-thirty-foot pit, you see. Now if somebody's going in and developing the property, it may be that part of the future requirements will be that you not destroy the vegetation, not take off any more than a certain percentage of the timber in your mining because in the past, you see, the old mining laws gave you enough of the timber to build your mills and your films and whatever you needed on your property. And if you followed some of those today, of course, you'd really tear up the landscape, you see. ---?--- protections of pollution and so forth. I think that they are becoming more concerned about
44

 LEON FRAZIER #2
this all the time, particularly with the water and the tailings and the polluting of the streams, and it used to be that the old mills would dump all the cyanides and the chemicals right back into the
streams. Geneva Steel Company last year dumped a batch of cyanide into their water after they were clearing up their blast furnaces up there, and it killed all the fish in the north end of the lake. They had to end up paying the state of Utah a substantial sum of money for killing all the fish in Utah Lake. And then back in 1951 Geneva Steel had to pay some very substantial damages because of the
fluorine that they were fluxing out in the ores. The burning actually of the Utah ore from down in southern Utah--the dust that would flux out, and it had a lot of fluorine in it, maybe four thousand parts per million, but they didn't even think about it. Over a period of time had built up such a concentration on the grass that the sheep and the cattle's teeth started dropping out--too much fluorine. So they put in four to six million dollars
worth of precipitators to take that out of the air, that fluorine dust. Plus, when they got into their mill over at---?---, Wyoming, they virtually ground it all down to a three hundred minus mesh and put it
45

 LEON FRAZIER #2
into pellets with a binder so that they're like little marbles and it doesn't flux up in stacks. And so we're getting into a period of leaching of ores on the old dumps. And you do it with cyanide leach which is a very dangerous chemical. And if the laws are not changed to protect the streams from the leaching processes, these cyanide leaching processes and other milling processes that are coming out, we're going to continue to kill off our fish and our wildlife and so forth. I think the mining law of the future is definitely going to have protections in it that have never been there before for the natural resources and the people that use them.
MH: Uh huh. They're going to be stiff ones?
LF: I think so. I think so. And in addition to the requirements as to how much annual assessment work needs to be done, they may even start specifying the type of work to be done, and not permit you to just go in and gouge out the land to see if you've got it
and so forth, you see, unless you've got so much you can do or where you have milling operations and you go in and you locate a mill site. Under the mining location you can locate a mill site so that it's a mill site that can take care of its waste in a certain way, and that they not leave these shafts for
46

 LEON FRAZIER #2
people to go and fall into and so forth, you see.
MH: Yeah, in essence, though they are problems of our society rather than legal problems, but because of neglect, they do fall under legal canons.
LF: That's right. Becoming more concerned about things. People now are more concerned with suing other people than they've ever been. So as people become more lawsuit-conscious and as the government is wiped away--you see, it used to be that the government you couldn't sue the government at all. But now you can
sue the federal government and you can sue the state government, and the concept of governmental immunity is being wiped away by decisions and by laws, legislation. And as the government finds itself more susceptible to law suits, they will tighten up the requirements on holes so that--well, you commit them, you require them to do these things, you see, and so not only do you sue the guy that goes out and digs the shaft, but you also sue the federal government and everybody else that you can on the theory that they require it, you see.
MH: So in essence, when you talk of legal aspects of the mining industry, the uranium mining industry, you're really talking about problems which result out of neglect?
47

 LEON FRAZIER #2
LF: MH:
LF: MH:
LF:
That's right.
And nothing else really. It's kind of like when everything is all left, the law has to finally tie up the pieces.
Right.
So ecology and the law aren't that far away at all when you talk about the mining?
Well, no. It's just a matter now of people becoming more concerned about pollution. We're using our natural resources more than we ever have before with the tremendous increase in the number of campers and trailers and parks that are being built. You see, we ¥ v e g o t t o p r e s e r v e t h i s s t u f f f o r f u t u r e generations. And it didn't used to be a problem when the "forty-niners" came West because they were the only ones out here, you see. It didn't used to be a problem down on the Colorado Plateau because there wasn't a great deal at Moab, you see. But then the motion picture industry started coming in, and they want to shoot movies, and they want to establish industries in Moab and in the southern Utah area other than the mining industry. And they say, "Well,
we can't do it. We can't make picture here because the landscape's all scarred up." They know that it's no longer virgin territory. You got plains all over
48

 LEON FRAZIER #2
the thing. You can't used your water, it's all polluted from the mining operations, you see, and so you find that your industry increases in various areas, the latitude that you permit the mining
MH:
companies to operate in the uranium field or any other field become more restrictive, you see.
Okay, thank you.
