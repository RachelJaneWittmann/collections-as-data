 THIS IS AN INTERVIEW WITH LOUIS PESTOTNIK, JR. IN PRICE, UTAH, ON MAY 5, 1982. THE INTERVIEWER IS NANCY TANIGUCHI. THIS IS FOR THE CARBON COUNTY COAL MINE ORAL HISTORY PROJECT .
NT Mr Pestotnik was born in Schofield in 1920, and worked at Hiawatha, Utah, and for the Kaiser Steel Corporation down at Sunnyside, and in 1981, he served as the secre- tary-treasurer for the Local #22 of the United Mine Workers of America. My name is Nancy Taniguchi
LPá NT LP NTá LP NT LP
NTá LP NT.
I don't know if I explained it the other day, but I'm working for the American West Center at the Universi- ty of Utah, and we're trying to do a lot of research on coal mining in Carbon County because, if you look at most of the histories of Utah, it's like Carbon County doesn't exist So it's about time we did something about that Now when you wrote down on that sheet that you were born in 1920, up in Scofield, is that right?
Right.
And, how come your folks were in Scofield? Well, my dad emigrated from Europe to there What part of Europe?
Uh, Y ugoslavia
What part of Yugoslavia?
Uh, they call it Novamaist I guess you'd identify it more closely in the area of Yuvlana(?)
Yes I know where that is.
In that region.
Yes And when did your father come over here?

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP 1901
NT Did he come with your mother?
LP No. He sent for her, and uh, then they got married here
later
NT Yes I see When your dad came, did he come straight to Utah, or did he stop someplace?
LP He stopped in Rock Springs, Wyoming Worked up there about a year, and then he come to Winter Quarters, Utah
NT How did he hear about Rock Springs down in Yugoslavia, or didn't he?
LP No, I don't know, I guess just by, uh, the grape vine, in those days, there was quite a demand for coal miners And they were emigrating extensively then
NT Yes
LP And they all come west
NT Yes When did he get down to Winter Quarters?
LP Right after that big explosion in 1902
NT Yes I see
LP The following year?
NT Yes And then, uh, how long did your family stay up in
Scofield area?
LP Well, I was born there, and uh, they went, they moved
Dad, he worked, in all the mines in Carbon County practically, except East Carbon, and he'd go from one mine to the other. My oldest sister and my brother was

NTá What's Mary's last name now?
LP Uh, Veschack
NT Okay
LP Her first husband was killed in the mines
NT What ' s her second husband's name , what's his first name? LP Veschack He is dead now
NT Oh, he is
LP He was a retired pensioner when he died But her first
husband's name was Temper She has a son that is a
foreman in the Price River Coal Company now
NT Oh, I see And so then your dad went to all the different
mines around?
LPá Well, the two was born up there and then, uh, he uh,
moved from there to Hiawatha And that's where my, uh, second oldest sister was born And then from there they went to Countesworth(?), and my third sister was born there, and then we went back to Scofield, and I was born up there Then after that, he moved back down here and worked in the Gordon Creek area, and Spring Canyon, Castle Gate

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
NT Yes .
LP Moreland's abandoned now I was in fourth grade when Dada
moved t here . I graduated from Huntington , North Emery
High school NT Isee
LP Because that is in Emery County, see
NT Sure Was it a tough adjustment to go from Carbon County
to Emery County?
LP . No Of course I was in fourth grade , and I           from
the t wel fth grade in Huntington I spent all my time in
Morel and and Huntington
NT Were the people down there about the same as the ones up
here?
LP In what way?
NT Well, as far as their attitude toward coal miners and coal mining and emigrants and all that
LP Emery County was predominantly Mormon, you know NT Yes
LP And, uh, some of my best friends are there ,
misunderstand me NT Oh,yes.
don' t
LP There was that attitude that those foreigners from the coal camps, you know, just didn't quite fit in with the environment , you know
NTá Did you ever feel that personally? 4

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP Yes
NT How did they show that they felt that way?
LP Just with remarks, nothing that was outgoing or really
well, should we say, injurious But just the attitude
that, "You're just not one of us " You know
NT Yes How many kids about your age would go from Moreland
t o school down in Huntington?
LP We had a whole bus load Most of them are still living
around here. NT Yes
LP Oh, I don't know how many that were tenth, eleventh, twelfth grade
NT And you would go back and forth every day?
LP: Every day
NT How long did that trip take?
LP Oh, in those days that was all dirt road and it would
take about an hour one way
NT What year did you finish high school?
LP 1939
NT And then, when did you go to work in the mines?
LP 1940
NT Where did you start out?
LP Hiawatha
NT At that time, were you living in Hiawatha, or still in
Moreland?
5

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP They shut Moreland down We moved from Moreland to Hiawatha
When did they shut Moreland?
1938
I see. But you still finished up at the
NT
LP
NT
LP. Right.
NT Emery Schools And when you started working Hiawatha,
LP
NT LP NT
LP:
what job did you take?
I started to work with my dad and my brother-in-law, the one that got killed in the mines, on the track, laying track.
Oh? Inside the mine?
Inside the mine
Yes And then from that what other kinds of jobs did you do?
Well, we didn't have seniority or bidding rights in those days. It was all management's jurisdiction at where they placed their men I just come from the bottom right up to the top
Yes.
The hard way
Yes What was the last job that you held?
Continuous Miner Operator, well, Mechanic--the last job
NT
LP
NT
LP
NT. Yes
LP Mine Mechanic
6

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
NTá When you got out of high school, where there a lot of jobs?
LP No There was only two of us hired that year in the mines
NT LP NT LP NT LP
NT LP NT
In Hiawatha?
That's right
How did you manage to get one of the jobs? I was just one of the lucky ones
Oh, that's .
---?--- Lacy and I were the only two hired that year He's still here too
What's his name?
Lyle Ace.
Oh, yes I do! Okay And when did things start to pick up around there?
When the war started gathering momentum, in Europe
LP
NTá Would that be, what, a year later, or two years later? LP Well, it started right around 1940 and 1941. See they
were already fighting in Europe before we got into the
war.
NT Yes. Sure.
LP And it was just a process that built up to Pearl Harbor NT Yes. Then, how did things change at Hiawatha once the war
started?
LP: Well, when I left there I was running what they called
7

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
NT . LP
NT LP NT LP
the Gathering Motor
Y e s
That was right from the loading machines in the mine, in the face of the mine And when I came back, why, they had already introduced new machines into the mine because I was gone for four years
Yes
They had what they called Buggies now
Yes
And they called them that then too, but that was one of the newest machines that they had introduced into the mines.
NT: Yes
LP Technology built up, and improved, and they had done away
with motors, gathering motors, and the buggies took their
place NT Yes
LP Then they introduced the continuous miners, the belt lines, and the long wall machines It was a gradual process of technology
NT: And so the better the technology, the more coal you could get out, right?
LP Oh yes. Was less manpower
NT So, during the war, did they hire a whole lot more
people, or did they mostly replace people with machinery?
8

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP No. They had around 700 people working in Hiawatha then NT . That 1 s amazing
LPá Miners
NT Yes.
LP That1 S not counting the families/ just miners?
NT. Yes And then when did they start letting them go?
LP. When the railroads converted to the diesel That was the
big thing that hurt the coal industry NTá When was that?
LP Oh1 right after the war/ when they started doing that.
NT. Yes
LP. About/ let1 s see it would be around 1947 1948 11
NT Yes.
LP And then 1 uh 1 the domestic market for coal in domestic
homes went downhill/ so there wasn1 t much market for coal/ and that1 S when depressed areas in coal industry started taking place We had around 400 1 000 uh 1 Union members under the United Mine Workers/ banner at that time/ and it went clear down to about 165 000 That1 S
1
throughout the United States
NT Boy that1 s really something That dropped to a place in
1
the 1950s? LP Yes
NT When did things start to pick up again?
LP They didn1 t really start picking up until the energy
9

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
crisis, now.
NT Yes So when would you put that at, around here?
LP Let's see, about 19 , uh, well, I guess when it really
started was 1976, but it was hardly noticeable then But that's when it really started, and then up to the present day.
NT So you're retired from the mines, right? LP Right.
NT. When did you retire?
LP
NT LP NT LP
I retired from the mines as a District Officer in the United Mine Workers
Oh, you did?
In 1977
Did you have to do that?
Well, I ran for election and was elected Secretary and Treasurer of the District
Yes
NT
LP
NT: And so then you had to leave your job at mine?
LP Well, then my term of office is up April the first of
In June of 1977, I took office
this year. NT Yes
LP And I didn't run for re-election, so and I'm not going back to the mine.
NT Right. Is it normal for a man when he's elected to a
10

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
Union office to leave his mining job? I mean, you can 't
do the two at a time, I take it.
LP No! It's a full-time job
NT I see What are the qualifications for being a UMWA
officer, do you have to spend so many years in the mines? LP Well, the eligibility rules say that you have to be a
member for let's see, three years NT Oh
LP And you have to be a United States citizen, you know NTá Yes. When did you first join the Union?
LP When I first started working the mine, January the
eighth, 1940
NT And was your dad also a Union member?
LP Yes
NT When did he join up?
LP Well, they organized the union in 1933, here in Utah NT. Right, I know
LPá And that's when he became a member
NTá Where were you when they organized the Union?
LP He was in Hiawatha I mean Moreland
NT In Moreland? And what kinds of organizing activities went
on there Were you hassled a lot by the company?
LP Yes They had to have their meetings outside of town Of
course I was pretty young then NT Yes
11

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP I remember my dad and my brother going down to these meetings outside the town limits, and then they'd come to Price and Helper and have meetings It was held under the cover more than anything, you know
NT Yes. Did the company fire men who joined the Union? Or LPá Oh yes.
NT At that time?
LP Well, sure If they knew they were getting involved 1922
was when the rally got onto them the first time, when
they tried to organize NT Yes
LP. My dad was out of a job for nine months because they found out that he was involved with the union organizing and that.
NT So where were you at that time, in 1922, your family? LP Well, let's see, I was born in 1920, so I'd been in
Scofield
NT And that year your dad got kicked clean out. Which
company was he working for up there? Which mine?
LP I'm not sure I think it was Winter Quarter I believe closed down then I'm not sure of that, either But what
they called UP, Union Pacific Mine had up there NT Yes
LP Then they had what they called the old Kinney Mine NTá Yes.
12

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP He was working in some of those mines right there
NT And, couldn ' t keep the job with the Union, huh?
LP Well, then, let's see, no, I think if I remember right,
I believe Dad moved back to Kenilworth around that time NT: Oh really?
LP And uh, that's where he was, in 1922, yes I think he was in Kenilworth because I remember him saying that he couldn't have a job if it wasn't for his friend, Jack Taylor He used to be a State Mine Inspector
NT Yes.
LP And he was my dad's best man at his wedding
NT Oh.
LP And he was, he was involved with management, but he was
helping my dad survive, you know
NT At that time, then, where was he, was he a Mine Foreman,
or Superintendent? LP Jack Taylor?
NT Yes Or was he still Mine Inspector?
LP. No, he didn't become Mine Inspector until later
NT Isee
LP But I think he was a Foreman or superintendent or
something like that
NT And so he helped your dad get a job
LP: Well he gave him food and stuff, no, not to get a job NT Oh, I see. Did your morn work?
13

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP. No.
NT Did your keep boarders or anything like that?
LP No.
NT How many kids were in your family?
LP Five
NT That must have kept her pretty busy So then after your
dad left Kenilworth1 where did he go? LP Umm
NT Where's the earliest . LP. Spring Glen, I think NT Oh
LP Up here.
NT Yes
LP Then he commuted to different mines from there
NT. And you just lived in Spring Glen, or what?
LP Y es.
NT Where did you live?
LP Right by the school house up there
NT: Yes
LP: On well, where the school house is, there's a street up
here, and there used to be a two-story house, right there
on the corner NTá Yes
LP I don't think its two-story anymore, I think they remodeled it
14

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK
MAY 3, 1982
NT Yes
LP But we lived right there
NT At that house?
LP Yes
NT: Were you renting, or did you own it?
LP Just renting, yes
NT Renting it Where did you go from Spring Glen?
LP To Moreland
NT When did you get up to Moreland?
LP About 1932
NT That's nearly ten years
LP. Right
NT Living in Spring Glen
LP Y es.
NT I see. So is that where you started school?
LP That ' s where I started school From the first to the
fourth grade, and then I went to Moreland in the fourth NT Now, as a kid down there in Spring Glen, were there a lot of other families just like yours, where the parents
were, fathers mined?
LP . Oh yes That was all mining except those that had little
farms and little gardens and stuff, but they all worked in Kenilworth or Castle Gate or Spring Canyon or one of them mines up in the canyons Or Gordon Creek or
NT How did the men commute?
15

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP
NT
LP
NT Yes
LP
NT
LP
I mean he would batch up in the mines, and then he would come home on weekends
I see And during the week then, what were your responsi- bilities around the house, or your brother's, I mean, how would you keep the place going?
Well my dad, my brother started working with my dad at a very early age, he was around fourteen, fifteen years old when dad took him in the mines
NT Yes
Well, my dad used to walk, most of the time That's a long walk!
I used to, well, not [sic] work
And uh..
Is this, which brother, is this Tony? Tony He's the only brother I got
LP
NT
LP
NT Isee
LP And he can tell you, his memory would be better than mine
on that, you know, about that time
NT Right And then your mom ran the house?
LP She would take care of the house and the family
NT Did you have a garden?
LP. We had a garden.
NT Any animals?
LP Not that I remember Let's see, we could have had some
16

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
lambs, I think, in fact I think we did have some lambs, - --?--- got ---?--- lambs and uh, raised them with the
bottle? NT Yes
LP I think we did have some NT What's a bummer lamb?
LP One that's lost its mother NT Oh.
LP And then its just abandoned and you have to feed it with a bottle with a nipple on the end, you know, just and
NT Yes And so then your dad would come home weekends, and you'd get to see him then?
LP Y es.
NT Didn't they work Saturdays, in the winter?
LP Sometimes. I believe they did, yes
NT What about summer? What did you do, as a family? Was your
dad working regular?
LP No Just visit neighbors and friends, and things like
that
NT Yes. Would your dad know in advance what days they were
going to work that week, or would he have to stay up at
the mine and see if he'd be called on?
LP Oh, he would know in advance
NT Oh, that's good. Then when you got to Ireland, was the
work more regular? Is that why you went down there, or
17

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
was the Union problem over?
LP Well, he thought he was going to get better work, yes
That ' s why he went out there Always looking for more work, and better, steady employment Back at that time, I guess the mines were working Moreland was working better than the others. So that's probably why he went
out there
NT How come? How come Moreland was working better than the
others?
LP They had, I guess they had a better market, or something NT So the coal is different from the different mines around
here?
LP Oh, yes.
NT And so there's a different market for each of them? Or is it just how smart they are?
LP Well, its just like it is now If they have their, some of them have better markets than others, you know
NT What determines, getting a good market?
LP The grade of coal, like you just said, and the production
of coal, whether they can produce it cheaper than the
other mine NT Yes
LP With manpower, or whatever machinery they have
NT Yes.
LPá I guess that's about the biggest thing, right there
18

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
NT Were wages different from one mine to another?
LP No.
NT Really? How did the mines go about setting their wage
scales?
LP Well, the Union set the wage scales
NT What about .
LP You talking about before that?
NT Before the Union
LP Well, I don't know. I think they, they probably were on
a competitive basis
NT Y es. because when ..
LP I know they were. Dad used to talk about contracting, you
know, coal. NT Yes
LP Hand loading Some mines would pay more per ton than other mines for their diggers and hand loaders, and so they didn't all pay the same on that, that part of it But when the Union came in, it was all uniform
NT Yes. When you were up in Moreland, what did you do as a kid, as fun, or did you have fun?
LP Climb those cliffs out there, and made our own little toys and guns, and what they call flippers
NT What are flippers?
LP Well, like we'd go get a fork out of a tree, you know NT Yes
19

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP Then you would get two elastic bands, and put a little holder on there, and use it to kill birds or whatever, or squirrels or anything
NT Yes.
LP It's pretty deadly, when you get to use one And then
we'd have little, what I'd say, gang wars is what we'd call them But they were all in fun . We would have these little rubber guns that we would make
NT Yes
LP And the trick to that was getting the rubber like the
inner tube from a car, or something, because they weren't too plentiful, like they are now If you got a good inner tube, then make some good rubber, elastic Well, it would be like elastic bands, you know
NT Big one
LP Then we would establish our own rules, and we'd go around
like we were fighting If we hit one of the others with
the rubber, why then we were automatically dead see NT Right
LP Until one gang wiped the other one out
NT How did you choose up sides for gangs?
LP Well, just through association and friendship, I guess NT Well, what kind of kids belonged [to] each one, were the
kids the age, or all the Austrian kids and all the Italian kids , or what?
20

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP No, there was what you'd call a family town There wasn't any class discrimination
NT There wasn't? Between the different, uh
LP The town itself was segregated into sections, the Greeks
would live over here, the Italians would live over here, the ---?--- over here, the Japs over here, the Negroes up here, and then the Mine Management and that down in another section But they all intermixed up in Moreland That was a nice town
NT Yes
LP In fact, they would have weekly dances, and everybody
would be friendly, even the bosses wives and that, would intermingle with the miners and dance with the miners, and things like that, you know It wasn't, like it is today, you know
NT Yes Was this during the 1930s that you mean, that you're talking about?
LP Y es.
NT When you went over to Hiawatha, was it the same?
LP When we went to Hiawatha, then we got into this here,
class.
NT What were the separations and, I mean, what made the
different classes in Hiawatha?
LP Well, your management, you know, the bosses and that,
thought they were a little bit better than the miners,
21

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
and just like [that] There is one man that is still alive around here that was a Foreman then, and I won't mention his name because it's on the recorder
NT Okay
LP But, he made the statement one time, his wife did, that
she wouldn't think of letting her kids play with those
miners' kids, see, so that gives you an idea
NT Yes Were there any separations between the miners as far as the ---?--- and the Japs and the Greeks were con-
cerned , or not?
LP Oh, some of my best friends even today are Greeks and
Italians We all played together, like Mike ---?---, if you know him
NT Yes
LP And hell, we would go down in the creek there and build
a swimming pool in Moreland, and we all played together NT Yes And in Hiawatha, was it the same?
LP No, there was that separation in Hiawatha, you know
NT Yes How did that happen? Was it fostered by the manage-
ment, or did it just seem to be the tradition of the town
or, as far as the two are concerned?
LP I think it just human nature
NT Really? But the two are so close, and you find people
going back and forth all the time
LP Yes People are like that. They reach a certain stage and
22

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
they think they're better than somebody else
NT So was Hiawatha a bigger or more important camp than
Moreland, is that what you mean?
LP It was bigger, yes
NT You think that might be one of the reasons why?
LP I think so
NT About how many people were there at Moreland, when you
were growing up, say in the 1930s?
LP Oh, I don't know That's something you'd have to ask my
brother. I'm even afraid to guess I know I was deliver- ing papers then, when I was twelve years old I had the whole town, winter and summer If I remember right, I had around 60, 70 subscriptions, subscribers Papers then were 90 cents a month
NT Sounds like a bargain now
LP Oh, boy And I'd have to cover that whole town, and have
you ever been to Moreland?
NT No I haven't I've been to Hiawatha, all over it, but
I've never been up to Moreland
LP Well, [in] Moreland the skeleton basements are still
there. If you had somebody point you out where the, like
we used to live what we called the knob NT Yes.
LP And where the knob was, there was a lot of Italians up there, and a lot of ---?---, and some Greeks
23

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
NT Yes
LP But then there was downtown, amusement hall foundation
still stands. And down there was, the mine Superinten- dent , bosses , foremen , and mostly Mormons Let ' s put it that way
NT Yes
LP They were concentrated there
NT Yes
LP: Because there was a sprinkling of other nationalities but
it was mostly Mormon, let's put it that way NT Yes
LP Then over there were the ---?---, where that loading ramp is now; they used to call that Timpletown
NT Yes.
LP And there was a lot of mostly Italians in there, and some
---?--- and other nationalities too Then as you went further up the canyon, then you got to where it was mostly all Greeks
NT Yes
LP They call that Greektown Then there was another little
settlement further up there, they call that Japtown NT Yes.
LP And then, right up at the top of the Japtown is where the Negroes were
NT Yes So you had to go all through the town delivering
24

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
your papers
LP Clear up there.
NT How did you get around? Did you have to walk?
LP I walked all the way In the winter I'd have a little sleigh, and I'd put papers on and when I got clear to the
top, I ' d ride the sleigh back empty.
NT Anybody ever get hurt sleighing down the canyon there? LP No
NT That's good. Because sometimes you know, they get pretty
steep, you get going pretty fast
LP Well, it was right on the road though, they had a road,
see.
NT Oh, I see. Did you ever play any sports as a kid, like
baseball, or football, in the camp?
LP Oh yes I used to play tennis, and in fact, I won the
Emery County Championship in tennis in my senior year in
high school.
NT Well, congratulations Was that at the high school, then? LP At North Emery High, yes
NT Did they have tennis at all in, up in Moreland or in
Hiawatha?
LP Yes, they had tennis courts there, and we used to play
there, and we played ball, baseball and NT Yes . How did you learn to play tennis? LP In Moreland .
25

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK
MAY 3, 1982
Well, who taught you?
I just learned on my own
NT
LP
NT
LP Right
NT How did you get your equipment, your racket?
LP Well, that's where I got some of my paper money
NT I see And then where did you buy it at the Company
store, or did you have to come into Price?
LP No, got it in the Company store up there
NT When you were buying stuff in the Company store then, as
a kid, did you have the script, or did you have money? LP Prior to that, they had script, and that was just, when I was just a kid then, and then they went into the money
end of it
NT When did they give up the script?
LP God, I don't remember; it was around 1938, 1937
NT Yes. So that didn't really have any connection with the
Union; it was just the Company's decision, or what? What
made them give up the script, in other words?
LP I think, uh I don't know I couldn't answer that
NT So when the union first carne in, it didn ' t necessarily
change a whole lot of things? Is that what you mean? LP Oh yes, it did You bet, it changed a lot of things NT What did it change?
LPá Working conditions , for the men
Watching other people?
26

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
NT Okay, how did it change them?
LP Well, it outlawed a lot of the policies the company was
doing before that time, like favoritism amongst the
employees. NT Yes
LP
And like I remember if a man had done any bitching at all, why they would reprimand him, and like my dad, I guess he started hollering about not getting his right weight when he was hand-loading on his cars They were cheating him on claiming he had too much rock in it, or something like that, you know It was outright cheating the men.
Right
And, uh, if they bitched about it, then they'd give him the worst place they had, and I remember dad used to uh, one time he come home and he'd complained about not getting the right money for his hand-loading, so before he knew it, they had him working in the water up to his knees, where he couldn't make hardly any money at all,loading and that Even to this day, you have some of
that
Yes
So there always are men that will brown-nose
Sure.
To better themselves I don't care whether it's union or
NT LP
NT LP NT LP
27

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
not, it still exists But when the union come in, it curtailed that to a big extent, to where it wasn't just free and all that, do as they pleased
NT When your dad was in the water, was that at Moreland? LPá Right.
NT: Was there a lot of water in that mine?
LP Yes
NT At least it made it safer, huh? Did they ever have an explosion out at Moreland?
LP No
NT Well, it doesn't usually happen if you've got that kind
of water, does it? What other things did the union
change?
LP: W ell, the work hours.
NT How would they change that?
LP Well when I started working in Hiawatha, you worked
eight hours right in the face, and from your home to the face , ---?---your time. And vice-versa, on the way back
And you ate lunch 15 minutes on your own time NT Yes
LP Well, down through the years, they have portal to portal pay now, your hours start when you first enter the mine and end when you come out of the mine You have a half hour paid lunch hour now , and in those days , you never had any of that
28

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
NT Yes When did these changes come in, as far as being paid for your time is concerned?
LP As they settled each succeeding contract, they would negotiate these things.
NT Isee
LP And better the conditions
NT I see. What other kinds of changes has the union brought? LP Safety That's the big factor right there
NT What kinds of safety practices have improved with the
Union; what kinds of things do they do now that they
didn't do back in the 1920s?
LP Dust control, and gas control, and roof control All of
these has come down with the efforts of the union to improve the stuff Back then, if you look into history, you had all these mine explosions that was either caused by gas or dust
NT Yes
LP The union put pressure on the government to institute
these safety features, made the government make manage- ment do these things, like rock dusting and to keep down the dust Checking for gas so that they won't have excessive pockets of gas that can be ignited, making them pin the tops so that the top won't fall It happens occasionally still yet, but you have at least a moderate medium of control. I'm not saying maximum because you can
29

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
always improve NT Yes
LP At least you have some, a moderate control
NT Who enforces all these regulations?
LP Camshaw and state mine inspectors, and union safety
inspectors The local Union has their own safety commit- tees, and these people are right on the job all the time Those are the ones that know what's going on day by day, and they should police their mines and make it safer
[for] their brothers
NT Yes Let's see, where there any things that the miners
didn't like about getting the union in? Now management, I'm sure there were things they didn't like--but the
miners?
LP I can't think of anything that they wouldn't like, unless
they were a company pet
NT That's true Was it possible before the union to go from
being a miner to being a foreman? LP Before?
NT Yes
LP Oh yes.
NT Do you know of anybody who did that?
LP Went right from the ?
NT Started out at the bottom as a miner, and then got to be
a foreman.
30

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP Well, he had to take his state mining test, you know
NT Yes.
LP They were so simple They were only 20 questions, true
and false questions, and if management saw a man they 1iked, why they would encourage him to advance, and they'd. Some of the best mining men I knew come up from the ranks was through experience
NT Yes.
LP And they were knowledgeable. They learned through the
school of hard knocks, so to speak
NT Yes. Were there opportunities for everybody to take that
test?
LP Oh yes, anybody could take it
NT Did anybody pass it?
LP Oh sure Some of those that hold their papers today have
got them that way
NT And then was it easy for them to get a position as a
foreman, or did they have to keep on mining, as a miner? LP Well, the company had that there, they still have that jurisdiction to advance a man once he qualifies with his
papers and that, they hire where they please
NT Has the union affected that at all, as to who gets hired
or can't they influence the management that way?
LP No. I wish they could because some of those people that are holding them jobs are not qualified, and they just
31

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
create a hazard for the people that are working under them And a lot of the people working under them are more knowledgeable than they are, and that's one of the things that, even when I was in office, I mentioned to the governor and the industrial Commission, and I'm still, the last time we had a meeting, I was still harping on that. Because I think that those people that are put in positions of responsibility should be knowledgeable and experienced, and they're not today because they've even made rules and regulations more lenient Before it used to be that you had to have at least three years of mining experience before you could take a test for fire boss
NT Yes
LP And five years for mine foreman. And they've made that
more ---?--- to where it's only two years, and I think it's three years now And I think they ought to go back, at least, to the old requirements, and I keep harping about that all the time
NT. But that's just a State law, isn't it, or a Federal [law]?
LP Well, yes. But then if you don't meet the state law you can't hold a position like that
NTá Right. But all these men that are in the position even though they don ' t have the knowledge, they have passed the test , is that right?
32

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP Right
NT Must be an easy test!
LP Well, I wouldn't say that, but everything you uh, there's
a lot of things you can't learn about out of a book.
NT Yes, that's true.
LP You might study and pass an examination in the book, but
not know a damn thing about what's going on
NT Yes And that's what's happening?
LP That's what's happening
NT I see What was the biggest strike that you were ever
involved in, here in Carbon County?
LP God, I've been in every one of them since 1940 That
three day strike was the longest NT In 1940?
LP No, not in 1940
NT When was that?
LP In 1977, wasn't it?
NT Yes That was the longest?
LP Yes
NT: When they get longer, do feelings run higher; people get
more
LP Definitely.
NT As union, you know as the Union's concerned, how do you feel about the strikes, does it, one of the important tools still? I know it used to be, but now--
33

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP If it's handled right, that's the only weapon that the miner has
NT What do you mean by saying, "it's handled right?"
LP Well, if they don't get too radical You know you can hurt yourself by getting too radical through negotia-
tions, is what I'm saying NT Yes
LP That ' s the way it should be handled
NT Yes How does the union pick their negotiators? Do you
have a special group of people that do it each time?
LP Well, that's their elected officials, that are doing it NT Oh, that's the ones that do it? And you don't pick any
extra special people? LP Yes!
NT Were you involved in that last one, as an official? When did you get your office of Secretary-Treasurer?
LP In June of 1977
NT So you were. Did you have to negotiate that one?
LP No, I wasn't See the president of the district is on the
negotiating team, not the Secretary and Treasurer NT Isee
LP But we all have some input
NT Oh, sure! And then you get input from the miners? LP That's where it should come from, yes
NT Oh, well, doesn't it?
34

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP Well, to a certain extent, I guess, but not like it should Now you take this last strike, if you remember, they were trying to sell the miners a bill of goods, the leadership was, and the miners didn't buy it So actual- ly, the miners were the ones that got the contract If they would have ratified that contract, like the leader- ship wanted them too, they've lost more than what they did lose.
NT Yes.
LP So we can thank the membership for being on their toes,
not the leadership.
NT I guess they have to work together You said you also
worked for Kaiser Steel .. LP 27 1/2 years
NT Where at?
LP Cotton Sunnyside
NTá Sunnyside? And what were you doing down there?
LP NT. LP
NT LP
NT
I run a continuous ---?--- there for 21 years Is that a good place to work?
Well, it was a dangerous, they have had ---?--- up there, and conditions weren't all that good
Yes could you do anything about it?
Yes Practice safety. Take care of yourself, you know, and your fellow workers, the best you could
What do you think is the best mine around here, to work,
35

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
as far as safety is concerned?
LP Now? At the present time, you mean? They all have
different conditions, that's the hard part about coal
mining, and that's what you don't get out of the books NTá Yes
LP And you have changing conditions from day to day They're not always the same In one mine, like Kaiser, maybe has had top, and they have gas, and it's a dusty mine Now Hiawatha over here is a wet mine, they don't have near as much danger with the gas or the dust, and when I worked up there, the top was about as good top as you could find, in most of the mines--there was some places that wasn't. Now I think those conditions could be still about the same because it's in the same strata, or some country.
NT Yes.
LPá
I've heard that they do have some bad top in some of the places, now. But what one contends with, the other doesn't have, you see. And there's a difference in the environment, and it depends on the individual, I'd say Now today, you have a young clientele, young miners Some of them don't even care about their brothers or themsel- ves, I guess Some of them are, even go to work with dope We've had instances where they find cigarette butts where they ' ve been smoking in the back entrees And this
36

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
worries me to a great deal because if this continues, and something isn't done about it, they're going blow one of these mines up
NT Oh yes, definitely.
LP And it just, even some of the inspectors, they'll agree
with me, I have some good friends that are inspectors, and they have that feat too If these young people don't wake up, and realize what they're doing, and the hazard they're facing, there's going be a tragedy here that's going to make everybody sick
NT What can you do about it?
LP Like I said, you've got. your safety committees, and even
some of those, I guess, are one of these rejects that I'm talking about. So I don't know, actually, unless you can get some laws passed with teeth in them, to where it doesn't become a management-Union problem, and make the, like I ' ve even told David Risky up in Kaiser--I said, "When you find a man that's on dope," I says, "you shouldn't fire him, so that It goes through the grievance machinery, and becomes a problem for the Union and the Management both," I said, "You have a narcotic divisions , agencies, " I says, "You should go right to the civil laws and uh, have the narcotics agents come in there and get that man It's a civil offense "
NT Yes
37

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP That takes it out of management, and union's hands entirely, and there should be no conflict there because i t's a civil offense , it should be dealt with as such
NT: Yes
LP Same way with stealing, you see And I told him, I says,
"By God, if you guys know that somebody' s doing that, why in the hell don't you set a trap for him, and get your law enforcement officers and take care of it that way Don't fire him and make a god-damned discharge case out of it "
NT Yes Has anybody taken your advice? LP Oh, he said it was a good idea
NT Oh dear.
LP But don't you agree with that?
NT I do, because I think that the unions [are] obliged to back up their members
LP Right
NT: Yet what these people are doing doesn ' t help the union
anymore than it helps management LP Right.
NT Yes, that does make a lot of sense But that doesn't mean that somebody's going follow it.
LP No, it isn't, but that's the way it should be dealt with I think it should taken out of the grievance machinery
NT Yes . There ' s just one more question I'd like to ask, and 38

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
t hen i f you have anything to add, you can I've had a lot of help of members of the UMWA that have been able to talk to me, and I really do appreciate it, but I'm also looking for people who used to be bosses, foremen, old- time supervisors Do you know of any that are living around here that I can talk to? That ' s the catch , they got to be living; it seems like there's a lot that have passed on.
LP How old would you
NTá Oh, somebody that was a foreman, at least in the 1930s,
or maybe even earlier, if that ' s possible, or a boss of
some kind; some management job.
LP I had a brother-in-law that was a boss in the 1930s, but
he is dead.
NT Yes, that's the problem I've faced.
LP That's going a long ways back, let's see I'd have to
study that some I'm sure there's some around, but if
they are, some of them would be senile now, you know
NT Yes, sure Well, anybody in the 1940s then?
LP Well, I know one man that was mine foreman when I started
working in the mines NT Yes.
LP His name is John Peperakis NT: Yes
LP And uh ..
39

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
NT He's still in Price, isn't he?
LP No, he's got his own consulting firm in Salt Lake City NT Oh
LP And he's one of the best mining men that I ever knew And
he goes way back there In fact he was my assistant mine foreman when I first started working in the mines, and he was graduated in, I think it was Colorado School of Mines
NT Boy
LP And uh, he introduced the ---?--- system into this
country And he is a knowledgeable man, and if you could
get to talk to him, that would be very beneficial
NT Well, I can always ask, all he can say is, "No "
LP That's right
NT Can you think of anybody else?
LP Well, let's see Okay I know a man that maybe could He
was a Federal Mine Inspector He was a Mine Foreman before that in Hiawatha I worked for him, and he was Foreman when we had all these different roof-falls and cave-ins and everything else, and like, they used to call Hiawatha the slaughter house around here
NT Oh really?
LP Boy, in those days, we killed seven men one year up
there.
NT In the 1940s?
40

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP Yes in the 1940s His name is Don Snow and he's retired He lives in Orangeville now, I believe
NT Okay
LP And uh, both of those fellows, you can mention me and
they know me good because I worked for both of them
NT Thank you, I will do that
LP Let ' s see. ---?--- , he's on a---?--- retirement, but he
doesn't go that far back Neither does Frank ---7---
Uh, Stanley Harvey NT Where's he?
LP I think he lived here in Price
NT Okay.
LP But Boyd Harvey is, uh, he's uh up in Price River Coal
now He's worked for him too He is a good mining man NT: And Boyd is Stanley's son?
LP. Right His dad's still alive, by the way His dad just
opened that mine up there above Clear Creek, he just closed it down again It had that loading ramp up here in Colton.
NT Yes
LP That's the Stanley family; the Stanley family is all
mining people.
NT Stanley or Harvey?
LP Stanley Harvey is his name. NT I see.
41

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP The old man. And then Boyd Harvey is his son
NT And they have the mine up at Clear Creek?
LP. Yes They just opened it up here a year or two ago, and
they just closed it down because it didn't have any
market NT Yes
LP Or something
NT Yes, that's right
LP But the old man was in that Hell, he must be in his
eighties
NT My heavens And what position did he hold, before? What
mine was he in?
LP He was up in uh, Columbia there, and in Clear Creek too,
I believe, as a superintendent, the old man NT Yes
LP Now he goes way back; he goes back further than John Peperakis does
NT Yes Well, now that they're not mining, maybe uh, he'd have a chance to talk to me
LP Oh yeah, I believe he would A lot of those guys, they like to get to reminiscing, you know
NT: Oh, sure.
LP I can't think of any, well, there's bound to be more
NT Well, if you think of any more, call me, because I do
need to talk to some bosses as well as some miners
42

 LOUIS PESTOTNIK MAY 3, 1982
LP NT LP NT
LP NT LP
Yes . Well , those are mining men from the first class Right Well, that ' s what you want, is the best. Right
It really is Thank you Is there anything else that you'd like to add?
No, not that I know
Okay I sure appreciate your time and your help
It's all right
