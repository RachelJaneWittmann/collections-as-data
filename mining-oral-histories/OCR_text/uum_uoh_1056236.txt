 THE FOLLOWING I S AN INTER VIEW WITH THOMAS E . KEELE CONDUCTED BY SUZANNE SIMON ON JULY 22,1970, IN 351 NO. 1ST W., BLANDING UTAH. [TAPE #125]
SS: Mr. Keele why don't you start by telling me something about where you were born and your childhood?
TK: Well, I was born in Heyburn, Idaho and I started school there when I was six years old. I think I went to first and second grade there and then my father has got called to Wyoming, northern Wyoming and Granddad had a ranch up there. That's his father--my granddad. So he wanted him to come back up there and run his ranch because he was too old to run it anymore and we had this nice farm in
Idaho and so we just give our farm up and sold it. It was a homestead, my father had homesteaded and it's over into Heyburn Idaho. So we wound up in Wyoming. Oh, we must have lived there until the Depression and my grandfather died and his property had went into oh, the lawyers went into probate court and so it might never have got off of there, so we moved to Utah because, you know, the mess of things legally.
SS: He didn't leave a will?
TK:
No. And so they sold, finally sold the property and just distributed it among the kids, his brothers and sisters, my aunts and uncles. But anyway the Depression was on then and we were in Provo, Utah, and I was, the only way my father had a way of making living then was to work for wages, the depression was on see. Jobs were hard to find.

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
So it was kind of rough and so as a result, none of us older kinds in the family--my family were ten children. There were five girls and five boys in the family. I was the oldest boy, but things in the Depression was real rough so that's when, in fact I left home when I was about 15 years old and started working. But why I got down here to Blanding was, I come down here to the CC Camp. After about 1932 why they started the CC's here. And I'd go into, what am I thinking about--'34, '35. And so I come down here. They had a CC camp here in Blanding and all of the CC boys was chasing the Blanding girls and the first time I'd ever seen.
SS: Those were the great old days.
TK: First time they ever, these girls used to where these cc
boys down the street, why they'd pull the curtain back and peek out the window at them you know. But as a result I guess there was about a dozen CC boys that remained here you know and married Blanding girls. I imagine there's at least a dozen down here. But anyway---?---
SS: Can I ask one question about, what kind of work did you start doing when you first left home?
TK: Well, we just did any kind of work. At that age we wasn't skilled at anything. At that time, why, might say we was just entering the machine age. Most of the farms were still run by horsepower, and it was a few years after
2

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
that, the first tractor I ever seen you know, tractors. But the cars then you know were crude you know. You see those '33 models you know, 1933 models and first car we ever had I think was a 1928 model, but we was just
entering the machine age, you know. So it was a difficult thing there. I mean, there was lots of, most of the jobs were just common labors you know. And so we, we'd you know, go around and catch freight trains. We was down in Texas down there and just out picking cotton and a few things 1ike this you know. Managed to get enough to subsist on you know.
SS: You felt pretty free though didn't you?
TK: Oh yeah. Well, there was so many people out of work then.
Every train was just loaded with men travelling back and forth hunting work you know, and even a lot of men didn't have to place for their families with them--their wives and kids. And then they had what they called hobos around all these bigger cities you know usually down on the river. And everybody would go down there you know and you could cook and wash their clothes down on the river there and hang them out on the willows, you know your clothes.
About like the hippies now.
SS: I never thought of it that way. I'm not too sure the
hippies ever wash their clothes though.
TK: No. You know we get old cans, these old honey cans, these
3

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
five gallon cans and with the lid cut out of them. There was always some of them around you know. And you'd get water you know and build a fire, heat water. Even cook your meals that way and warm down there. You didn't need much. Most of the time it was warm in Texas. Mississippi and all over the South. But anyway---?---but anyway that was the beginning of the start I had in life. Oh we had some rough times. We never very seldom slept in a bed you know. We all slept on the ground and we never was sick very much.
SS: Did you have to go hungry very often. I mean or did you manage to---?---?
TK: No, the people was real hospitable then you know. Farmers and stuff like that, you'd go around and want to do some work for stuff and they'd give you, you know, the old farmers had eggs and meat and stuff like that, you know, you could always find work for stuff like that. If something like that was to happen now--an economic depression where people had done that before, I doubt that people would be hospitable.
ss: Yeah, you're probably right.
TK: In fact I was in Texas when the Bonus Army had went to
Washington and you've probably studies history and know about the Bonus Army and how they were sort of on a bent like we have these demonstrations now and they was over
4

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
there trying to demonstrate you know, to get the administration that was in power to pay a bonus a little quicker than what the Congress had provided it be paid because they was hard up and the president I understand
ordered then driven out. So the Army fixed bayonets and drove them out of Washington. They were all, this bunch of people that were in there were all--most of them were ex-World War I veterans and so in the South down there a lot of them are hard up and in practically every city that I was in they had organized and they were marching, Bonus Army. They had their banners, 'Bonus Army' and this was just prior to the election of President Roosevelt in 1932. And of course after he got elected why one of the first things they done was ask Congress and Congress provided the money and they paid the bonus.
SS: And got the cc going which brought you to Blanding.
TK: Right. And of course I was doing all these things and I don't know hard these people were up. But when we got in
the CC, the miners we got paid, see, didn't go to us. We only got, I think it was eight dollars a month and then the rest of it was sent home to your folks. So I mean, the government furnished everything. We had a camp doctor. They furnished all your clothes and all your food.
ss: Was it a very big camp here? 5

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
TK: Oh yeah. It was just Regional Grazing at that time we
called it. Grazing Service now, Division of Grazing at that time they called it. They were working for them and I think there was about two hundred men in the company. Our company strength was about two hundred.
ss: How big was the town?
TK: Oh it was a lot smaller than it is now. I think, if I
remember right it was about seven hundred.
SS: How long did you stay in the CC?
TK: Well, I stayed in quite a long time until about 1935.
Let's say from '34, 35, '36 I stayed in and then I left went over in Uravan, worked in a uranium mine. Before I was ever married. That was about, I was about 19 years old.
SS: What was Uravan like in those days?
TK: Oh, Uravan was just a small place and US Vanadium
operated, the company operated it, and they owned the company store there and all the houses there were owned by the company. They rented them. And then they run a boardinghouse and had rooms and board, board and room. But we wasn't right in, that was the people that were in the mill see. The mines were up, most of the ore they got up at Long Horse on those bluffs above Paradox Valley and we worked over there in those mines for seven days a week for fifty cents an hour. We worked every day and we had
6

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
to pay, we paid, it cost us one day, we paid seven dollars, cost us a dollar a day for board and room. And we made eight dollars a day.
SS: You worked a long day if you only getting 50 cents an hour.
TK: Oh, let's see. No, we made four dollars a day.
SS: Oh, yeah.
TK: We worked seven days for 28 dollars. We got 21 dollars a
week.
SS: And how about the prices in the, I guess you had to buy
TK: SS: TK:
ss: TK:
your stuff there at the company store.
I suppose we never had to buy any groceries.
Oh yeah. You had your room and board.
We had to buy clothes, and we played poker and lost most of the money. The card sharks got it. We had a poker game every night you know, somewhere.
Well, was it a very big town? How many men worked there? Well Long Park is, I probably can't remember all the mines that were there. They were just scattered all over. There were, there were the Callradium and the Cripple Creek. That's where I worked in the Cripple Creek. The
Cripple Creek and Callradium was connected underground and then there was the Honeymoon and the Club. There was just several mines, see, that were all around. And long Park was a big area and they'd be, from the one end to
7

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
the other was probably about five or six miles and that's where this mineral was. And this is where Madame Curie mined, this French Madame, this is where she got a lot of her uranium.
SS: I'll be darned. Now is carnotite up there?
TK: Carnotite.
SS: And you say that you worked in the Cripple Creek, what
did they assay under there?
TK: At that time they just high graded, uranium with a high
grade, they sacked it up and shipped it. US Vanadium was interested in the vanadium and as near as I know at that time, why the low grade vanadium like thirty hundredths and twenty hundredths they just went out and dumped. I suppose they rerun it later. But when we find those high grade yellow carnotite trees why that was worth a lot of
money and they sacked it up and sold it. Shipped it out, but and there was a lot of that in there. That's where, really that's where the uranium boom first started you know. Over in this country, over in Long Park. That whole country was just honeycombed, you know, with just little tiny tunnels that Madame Curie had mined. I forgot now the amount of uranium she took out of Long Park but it
was a lot. The area up there, Uravan.
SS: Where is Rifle in relation to Uravan.
TK: сOh Rifle's quite a long ways from there. It's the other
8

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
side of Grand Junction and Uravan is south of Grand Junction so Rifle I would say is about 60 miles up the Colorado River, from Grand Junction. And we're talking about say 60 miles south, straight south of Grand Junction.
Were there any independent miners or did USV hold most of it?
There weren't any individuals as far as I know that had any claims in there, but there were other companies that had claims in there. But they weren't, at the time I was
SS:
TK:
ss: TK:
in there, they weren't active. They weren't mined. Their claims would be shut down. In fact there was another company that had a mill down at Nucla that eventually Vanadium Corporation of America, VCA, they acquired their mill, or not at Nucla, Naturita and that's where VCA got their property, their mining property and everything was from th is company.
It wasn't the Standard Chemical Company would it?
It seemed like, that could have been it. I've seen their name you know hundred times on that old mill but I can't remember what it was. But their property, their mill was right there. ~hat's right where the VCA bought theirs and
then they, of course they added on to the mill.
ss: How long were you up there?
TK: Oh, I must have been up there about a year and a half. I
9

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
worked underground there. In those days they didn't have mucking machines or nothing like that. We shovelled it
all.
ss: Would you describe the process to me of how you go about
mining the ore?
TK: Well, first if we're in a body of ore you know, it's what
we call full face of ore, why we just drill just a normal round you know and it's soft, it's soft. It breaks easy. So you don't have to drill so many holes in the face as you would hard rock mine, but it usually takes the, to pull a round out of the face in this type of mining this sand rock mining, sedimentary deposits it takes about four cut holes and then two side holes and three back holes and about three lifters and once in awhile if it's a big face, if it's a real big face you have to call what we call breast holes, you know, so that there isn't too much loading on the lifters, you know. And around like this and about a seven, seven face will produce about 20 tons. Then you, afterward you just run the drifter straight ahead you know, blocking it out. Of course if you was out mining then you could just slag off you know then that's cheaper drilling--blast it out that way then it is right straight out of a face. But in them days we had to set up a column and check. It would take all day long for a good driller to drill the round holes and load
10

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
them and blast it. See that would be one day's work for mining and then two muckers would go in the mine and muck this round out, see. These here mine cars was ton cars would be twenty cars of ore they'd have to muck out.
SS: When you working in Cripple Creek what kind of drilling equipment did you use?
TK: Well, we had our air compressor up to top see, and with the air piped down to the air hammer and then this air hammer was fixed so that it bolted and we set it on a column on a leg. Now this leg was just a big bold deal you could screw up tight against the ceiling so it would hold the weight of the hammer, and then it had a screw feed that you just fed the thing in and then drilled two feet changes with steel see. Of course that's all obsolete mining now. They don't use that kind of stuff.
SS: No, but it's important to know how they did it in the beginning you know.
TK: Well, in the beginning when first time I worked down here, Blanding Mines down here for Garwood down here in Cottonwood, they was a single jacking by hand.
SS: By hand. I bet you felt like you put in a day's work when you had done that all day.
TK: Well, I run the first hammer they ever got down there and they never had any, they never had any column to set it on. We had to hold it up with our hands. Drilling holes,
11

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
you know, and that bucking jack hammer. Boy that was a strain. We couldn't stand it now, but we called up, so we
rigged up a piece of pipe and a hook and fit in a bolt and a hammer and we could set the hammer on that pipe see and then they named that setup there, they called it the Mexican setup. [laughing]
ss: Well, had you mined down at Blanding, in the Blanding Mines before you went to Uravan?
TK: No, that was after. I forgot what year that was now.
SS: Well, we don't have to know exactly what year.
TK: There was some people come in here from California and
they had a fellow by the name of Garwood that backed them and bought these properties off the Shumways. Now Gary's father owned that property and they sold it to Garwood. He's probably told you about it but I worked in that mine for quite a long time. Kimberlys, oh, Howard Kimberly and his father came out here and they was running, but they built a mill there and everything and they were going to sell the vanadium to Hitler. That's who they were selling it to, and then the government stopped them. It wasn't a success. They never did make any money down there until after the government set up this Metal's Reserve in Monticello and they started buying this ore and they shut the mill down and then they just started giving all their
ore to the government here in Monticello. This
12

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
corporation that was set up--Metals Reserve. But they made a lot of money then and these miners would pay, they was just getting paid for the vanadium. Of course we
SS: TK:
SS:
learned later that they were catching the uranium was what they were interested in for Manhattan Project.
But you didn't know anything about that?
Oh no. It was one of the best kept secrets there were in
the world. Possibly maybe the German espionage might have known somebody. There wasn't anybody around here that knew anything about it.
Well, tell me about mining down there in Cottonwood. What kind of ore did you have there?
TK: We had the same type, carnotite. It was in the same formation--the Morrison formation--as the Uravan is. The common name here is Morrisonite. A guy can't even pronounce the right name for some reason. But they had oh, that ore out there, most of that ore out there was
what we call rattlesnake, was kind of a brown ore and it had a lot of conglomerate pebbles in it you know. And they called it rattlesnake. This ore down here was blue oxide down here. Most of the high grade was blue. Real dark blue ore. And this is a real good grade ore down
here, real good.
SS: That mill that Garwood had down there--did it ever, was
it ever a success or---?---? 13

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
TK: No I don't think it ever made any money. If it ever made
any money why somebody else got it besides those people. ss: What was the matter with it? Did it not have a good
TK:
process?
No, the process was all right and the people running it knew what they was doing but they had just got so much junk and put it together there, all their liquor tanks leaked--stuff running down the creek and their values run away, got away from them. But they were, they were always
in trouble financially and they couldn't borrow what they needed to run things with. They just cobbed things up you know.
Maybe not quite enough capital to really---?---
Garwood had all the money he needed to put in there but he kinda didn't trust the people that was running it or something because he wouldn't give enough money to them. When Garwood finally, when these people finally just give up, well then they had ran up a tremendous bill here with some of these local business people. There was a guy in Cortez that had been supplying oil. He was Conoco dealer and I can't remember his name. And then there was Marvin Lyman here and he was a Conoco dealer here and Howard Kimberly was one of them, but anyway all these people went together, oh there was a lawyer in Monticello, Donald Adams and they was the ones that formed Blanding
ss: TK:
14

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
Mines and Mr. Garwood let them lease his property you know to operate it and get their money back. About the time they took over, they ran that mill for awhile. It wasn't long after they got started that this Metals Reserve got going so that saved and then they finally went on to make, I suppose they made a pretty good chunk
of money.
SS: But when the Metals Reserve was operating was a pretty
good time for the miners, mining industry here wasn't it? TK: Oh real good. The best they ever had.
SS: Better than later?
TK: Well, no this last uranium boom they had here was, more
millionaires made. There was a lot of little miners here the time Metals Reserve you know that made a little money, you know, made better than wages. But when Charlie Steen and all that bunch, Joe Copper and Fletch Bronson and all of those why when they you know, when they acquired this property old Fletch and Joe Cooper and Grant Bronson, it was a father and son and son-in-law. When they went down and got that Happy Jack, they bought that for copper and they tried to sell the copper up at Salt Lake and up at Midvale and US Smelter sent it back and says, 'Don't ship us any more. It's got too much uranium in it. We can't buy it.' The government had a
clamp on it see.
15

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
SS: How did they get that ore out to Salt Lake City.
TK: Oh there was a little old trail down there, a little old
washed out trail, they had a little Bobtail, and they trucked it to Thomson on this Bobtail truck until they got a carload--a sixty ton carload. And they shipped it on the train from Thompson.
SS: Oh I see. Let's got back aways. When did you get started doing some prospecting on your own?
TK: Well, I learned about this here, just mining in it you know. And I got a job for VCA. I was building a road down to this Monument Two Mine. I built that first road. I went down there with a Navajo guide and built the first road into that Monument Two Mine. That's the richest mien that they ever--in this country there. Old Harry Goulding, the guy that owns Monument Trading Post in Monument Valley you know was the prospector for, Denny Viles was the boss. He was our boss. And they had the mill in, they had contracted this mill here in Blanding and later on they acquired the mill in Durango and then they had the one over at Naturita. And I started working for them driving a truck and we was hauling uranium, vanadium ore from over through Shiprock over on Lukachukai Mountain, what they called east and west side, one place we called by Teec Nos Pas and we load up over on the west side of the mountain and the next time maybe
16

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
some trucks would go down by Red Rock, Round Rock and they'd go over on the west side of the Lukachukai Mountain all night haul. We had a big stockpile there at Shiprock of uranium ore stockpiled. It's like a mountain.
SS: Real rich stuff?
TK: Real good stuff. Well, it wasn't sacking ore or something
like that it was probably about thirty hundredths
uranium.
ss: But, let's see, when did they get started operating #2,
Monument #2?
TK: Well, they had that before the war. They got that about,
during World War II, when I built that road down there. After I was drafted and then things died down. But VCA still held that property, see, was an Indian lease. They had a lease Navajo Tribe, and they even subleased out to, one guy here had a lease on it here in town now. Gibb Shumway went down there and mined a 1ittle and Tony Shumway. And then of course, this Tommy Balsley and everything and it was several years after the war they didn't do anything with uranium much and then after when the government really started buying it to develop atomic, 'atom for pe~ce' and all this stuff why that's when the uranium boom really started. Well, they already had theirs found, but they never even know then it was that rich. They had just barely mined a little bit out of
17

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
there, just, just a small amount during World War II.
SS: What was the channel like down there at Monument Two? TK: It's a big channel but it had three scours. They never even knew the bottom was there and that was the one that was really rich. But it was, it was different than these
ss:
TK:
SS:
TK:
other formations just like in the Shinarump.
Then you don't think that earlier, before the war or during World War II that even VCA knew how rich it was? Well, old Denny Viles was pretty foxy and knew most things, but I don't think he had any idea how rich it was.
You say you worked for VCA trucking, what type of an outfit were they to work for.
Oh, they was, they got all they could for the dollar you know. We got 96 cents an hour and that was, before World War II was going on, driving a truck. Of course when I started building that road down there why they had a little higher rate for that. They had that old swinging bridge down there. They had another mine they called Monument #1 over south of Harry's, over at Harry Gouldings. And we hauled, practically mined that out during the war. It was just a little mouth there, just set up there, there was hardly any open pit mine and the had Navajos, they'd get navajos, get down there and get a load and they'd have so many Navajos around them
18

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
trucks, they'd just load it with shovels and they'd load you in pretty good time. Then we had to come back to the bridge at Mexican Hat. They had that 1ittle Swinging
ss:
TK:
SS: TK:
SS:
TK:
Bridge, was the only bridge that was there. And we couldn't bring a full load across there. We had to dump half the load on this side, on that side, and then bring the half a load across and dump it over here and then we had to go back and shovel the other half on and then come shovel this other half on. The drivers had to do that. Wow, that really made---?---you wouldn't think about that
along with driving the truck would you.
I was working for them, and then old Cecil Jones, this game warden in Monticello. He was a driver for them. A guy named Ralph Miller. He was out there. He was a driver.
How many, how big a truck was this?
A nine ton truck running most of the time we had about 11. They were white trucks. And what did they call them? I think it was #17 White truck.
How long did it take you to shovel 11 tons of ore back on to that truck?
Oh, we was in good shape. We'd shovel the ore in a couple of hours.
SS: Well, Denny Viles was your boss then. Did you know him very well?
19

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
TK: Oh yeah. Yeah, I knew him, I ran into him in cafes later
you know as I had been working somewhere else you know and he'd want me to go back to work for him, and bought my dinner and you know.
SS: Did you like him as a boss?
TK: Yeah, I didn't mind Denny so bad. I was supervising,
looking after their property. This Garwood property here one time and I just had to go out there and watch. It was all leased out. This fellow came over there named old Wilhite out of Cortez there, and I can't remember his first name now, but it was after the government had drilled over in the Garwood and they found several spots of ore you know, several bodies of ore around on this property. Cecil Wilhite I believe his name was, no, Andy W ilhite; Cecil was a truck driver. Andy W ilhite and Andy was over there and Denny came over there with his engineer to show him which lease he could have you know, to mine, and so they had looked at two places there. All of the places there, and so they had it all broke down. He could have either this one or that one. His choice and he couldn't make up his mind, Denny, he couldn't make up his mind which one he was going to give old Andy. And so Any he says, 'Why don't you just let me have both of them.' And old Denny, he says, 'Yeah, you want to get in
business. ' And old Andy says, 'The VCA' s in business
20

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
ain't they?' He says, 'I guess so.' But Denny never done any business on paper. He made all these leases verbal, see. And he never had anything, never had any kind of a contract on paper. And he remembered, he had hundreds of them and he had it all in his head and he remembered what every deal was, and that's the way he made every deal.
SS: He must have been quite a fellow. Is he still around? TK: He's retired. He lives in Durango. The VCA, they sold out. They're not in business. But they sold out to Climax
Uranium.
SS: Do, did you think Denny Viles gave the miners a fair
shake most of the time?
TK: No, he was a company man. He never gave anybody a fair
shake. I mean he, he was a wonderful guy for the company though. I mean in his way of doing things, of course, maybe perhaps Denny Viles like he was that the VCA had to get out of business. Because they got such a bad name. There wasn't anybody that'd work for them. The independent miners wouldn't sell ore to him. They'd get gouged. And so I mean that's possibly the reason they're out of business today.
SS: Y eah.
TK: But while he was going he made money for them. He made
lots of deals and Denny never would mechanize things. He always stayed with handling you know. When all these,
21

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
this new modern drilling equipment and stuff come in why Denny was, he just had to be shown. And he wouldn't buy any mechanical loaders you know. He made everybody load
shovels and this was another thing that was wrong. He was just and old style business man. He made millions, you know the hard way. Just a hard dealer.
SS: Well, let's go on with your career. When did you start staking claims?
TK: Oh, I started too late. After all the good was gone. [laugh].
SS: Where did you start?
TK: Well, these, I'd staked some claims off and on
occasionally before this time. It was after the
government started offering these bonuses you know. SS: AEC bonus.
TK: About the time went prospecting.
SS: In the boom, the boom years then. Early '50s.
TK: And so I quit my job down there. I was hauling gas for
Black Oil, old man Black, got a truck. And I quit my job. My brother-in-law, Rex Neilsen was running a delivery truck for him. I'd run the transport. So then I got a job prospecting for some outfit out of Oklahoma. And this geologist that they had here was a squeeze-neck, real tight. So finally we quit him and went on our own, went on our own prospecting. And we got some good claims. In
22

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
fact we even had some property that produced uranium, the government came in and started drilling on our claims and about the day before that, why we'd signed them over to a corporation you know, and they issued us stock for them. So we didn't own it anymore. But they hit ore and mined the ore.
Did you get stock as your interest in the claims?
Well, these people we had who formed the corporation were Bill Gibson, Bill Browning, Jules Roberts, and Dr. Osmond, and Eastmond Hatch. Now this Eastmond Hatch is a brother-in-law to this Atlay guy, Court Ogle, and they're all big money fellows and they, they financed the thing and got it through the Security Exchange Commission and we become a company, called ourselves South Elk Ridge Uranium. And we put out claims in at, I forget now the price. And we got so much a claim for them stock. And before we got the stock it comes out thirty cents a share, and before we got the stock we already had uranium, a nice body of uranium already found. The government drilled didn't cost us nothing and I was running this end there and they showed me the drill reports on them and everything and before the stock was out--what they intended to do was raise a hundred and fifty thousand dollars by selling this reserve stock see.
They had as much stock to sell as they had issued us as 23
SS: TK:

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
was in the company you know, got the shares. So they were given, these Salt Lake People were given over a dollar share for them before we ever got our stocks see. So then we, our stock never did get on the market and the people that owned the stock in it--they never did put it on. They bought up old stock. But we was poor, we didn't have the money. I finally talked the banker down here at Moab
out of--if he'd give me enough money so I could buy five thousand dollars worth of that stock see, that thirty cents a share because it was worth a dollar a share. If I'd buy another, if I'd let him buy another five of the mine, see. I was entitled to buy as much as them guys were, so I let, so I could buy my five thousand, I had to let this banker buy five thousand dollars worth.
ss: That was a pretty sure investment wasn't it? For him. TK: Yeah it was all right.
SS: What are your claim names up there?
TK: Well, these ones that were good were Okies.
SS: Okie?
TK: An Okie Mine was one. Then we had some Hope claims across
the canyon from these. They were on the Verge Canyon. ss: Now is that the Shinarump?
TK: Yeah, this is all the Shinarump. And then we had some
claims over in Lyman Canyon and I think we had then claims over there called Lyman claims. Then we had some
24

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
down in Wooden Shoe. We called them Wooden Shoe claims down in Wooden Shoe Canyon.
SS: And did you produce any ore out of those others.
TK:
No, we never did produce any ore. This had, the rock was mineralized there, you know, and had good geiger activity around there, but we never could find an ore body around there. We done quite a bit of drilling too trying to find
ore. We never did find any.
Did the AEC do any drilling on your other claims?
Yes, they dome some drilling too. They, they found traces you know of what we call mineralization and that stuff produced low grade ore you know, real low grade. But we couldn't ever find anything you could mine.
What did you do with those claims?
Oh we, our whole company we merged, the bigger company, with bigger company. Federal Resources and I forgot just how, we give them so many shares of ore for their, we merged into those there and-- Come in. That's my daughter-in-law.
Oh.
ss: TK:
ss: TK:
SS:
TK: But, this is---?---
SS: Now, let's see, you were telling me how you disposed of
your other claims on Ore Mountain and across.
TK: This company, Elk Ridge Uranium, all of our stock see was in escrow and we couldn't spend it, couldn't use it and
25

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
couldn't get it out of escrow unless we paid a dividend that had to equal the percentage of what we could raise and Bill Gibson and the people that was the officers of Elk Ridge Uranium were influential in the bigger business world. And they knew these people from New York that owned Federal Uranium and most of them so they peddled our company at Federal is what happened. And we was
issued Federal stock and me and my wife had kept our stock today or a short time ago we sell it for about twelve, thirteen dollars a share.
How much---?---?
We had 17,500 shares didn't we?
So, but you, how long did you hold it?
Oh we sold about as fast as we could. My wife wanted the money. [laugh]
No. I didn't.
Well you sold it anyway.
Some people here still got stock they bought through that company.
There was quite a few mining people in this company. Kurtis Jones had a pretty good chunk.
MK: Ida Nielsen.
SS: TK: SS: TK:
MK: SS: TK:
SS:
MK:
TK:
ss: What is her name?
Grandma still had some. My mother. Oh she's still got hers.
26

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
SS: Ida Nielsen?
MK: Uh huh. And Vera Smart still has some stock in it. I
SS:
TK:
SS: TK:
SS:
TK:
MK: TK:
can't remember if she has a little stock left--maybe she doesn't. But my mother has---?---
Did you have any other claims other than the Elk Mountain area?
No, that's the only place we had any claims there. We had, the company, everything they owned was right there on that mountain.
Did you have any claims over in White Canyon at all?
I mined down there in the Happy Jack Mine. I had a lease down here one time when the Happy Jack Mine was---?--- Is that right? Tell me about the Happy Jack. Everybody talks about the Happy Jack but I haven't talked to anybody that---?---
I mined in the Happy Jack, me and Bud Nielsen and Keith Jones. But Nielsen is the city manager down here. Jones is a successful beer store man in Bluff and---?--- Grocery store.
Grocery store man, and Will Joe Nielsen, he's an Indian trader down on the Navajo Reservation and Russ Fullgare got a lease off of Joe Cooper and Fletch Bronson, Guy Bronson and we went out there to mine. VCA had built a little pilot mill to try recover this uranium out of the rock. This, uraninite ore was new around country and it
27

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
hadn't ever been processed. They hadn't ever, no one had
ever processed it before.
SS: That's the uranium and copper combination?
TK: Yeah, And so he built, he hauled ore, Elk Mountain, he
hauled a little old pilot mill and put it down in Hite, and the Shumways sold him over down there. They had the Shumways; Harris, and Abe and Lee and Seth, the old Shumways. They had a lot of claims in the White Canyon. So Mr. Viles, VCA, went around to all these people that had property around there and they got them to sign up and he tied all their ore up for nothing. All this property up and they couldn't sift their ore or sell it or sell the mines even, sell the claims to anyone. And the only way he had to pay for that ore, he had to soon as they assayed the ore why then he had to give them thirty percent of what it assayed and then after the ore was milled why then they got paid according to what the recovery was, see. If the recovery was only thirty percent, why that's all they got was thirty percent. So we leased this one part, the main part of the Happy Jack, it was just a side part on the side channel there and we went down there and we shipped several truckloads and we started drifting back in and it didn't run very good. But about the time we found out it wasn't running, why we had really run into some good grade ore samples. So we stayed
28

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
and mined and we mined down there awhile. Finally we starved out and we had to settle for thirty percent of the ore. That's all we got was thirty percent. We got one bar, they paid us thirty percent of what the ore assayed and when they give us the final settlement it was lots of
ore such and such a number and this was final payment for that ore. That's all we got. We got paid thirty percent of that. That's the kind of contract we had. The Shumways sold all their property to a fellow named Phil Sidney. He's been out here at Dove Creek.
[END OF S I D E ONE)
TK: And I guess Finnel made millions of dollars off of that
property. And then but he broke the contract with the VCA, with the help of the AEC. The AEC says that contract wasn't, that they couldn't hold that kind of contract, you know that the government had special powers over uranium that Congress had given them and that this here contract was illegal because of the uranium and because of the special power Congress give the AEC over uranium, so when that happened that turned Joe Cooper and Fletch Bronson and the Happy Jack Mine over you see. But they never did make, Joe Cooper and Fletch, they worked hard down there. They worked in there mining and everything and of course they later on sold out maybe six or seven million. They sold out to Texas-Zinc, TZ who built the
29

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
mill down at Mexican Hat.
ss: Well, that pilot mill that VCA put in there couldn't,
didn't seem to be able to recover the uranium, is that
the problem?
TK: Well, that's what they, that's what they claimed and then
they later on loaded up all their tailings and hauled them out and had them remilled so their process probably didn't work. So Imagine VCA probably lost money down there too. But they, if they could have held their contract they would have owned everything in White Canyon, practically the same, see. They had to borrow a bond contract, they couldn't sell it nowhere else. And they could buy it for thirty percent down see and then when they milled it, why then they had, then the miner had to stand the mill recovery loss see.
ss: Yeah, they had the miners by the nose didn't they?
TK: Well oh, Cooper told me a lot of times, he's dead now, he told me a lot of times that he hated to sign that contract but he was afraid that the government or nobody
would every buy that ore and he'd be sitting on that body of ore no place to sell it, see. Old VCA went down there and had worked out a recovery on it and everything and then they could just sit there and froze them out, see. That's what he was afraid of so that's why they signed the contract. But they were real lucky to get out of it
30

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
and you know and make the money they did.
SS: Did you know Cooper well?
TK: Oh yeah. I knew him real good.
SS: Tell me about him. What kind of a fellow was he?
TK: Oh he was a mechanic. The first time I met him he was a
mechanic for Moab Garage in Monticello and he was a mechanic there. He was a good mechanic Joe was. He was a conservative fellow and you know he saved his money. And
then he bought him a little poor tractor. Carloader tractor with a bulldozer on it and then he quit mechanic in that and then he went out on his own making stock watering ponds. A few cedar trees for the stockmen you know. And his father-in-law old Fletch Bronson was the guy that was always prospecting see. Of course, old Dan Hayes and a guy that's dead here in town, Jesse Johnson, and another guy that's dead now, his brother old Edgar Hayes down at Moab. They went down and staked their claims on they staked them for copper. That was during World War II you know when copper was good.
SS: Y eah.
TK: And they thought, that their old father had had that
mine, that copper deposit before and he had packed it down off there and put it on wagons and they hauled it clear up across the river and up to Green River there during the War, see. Maybe not during the War but
31

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
sometime earlier you know and in the wagon days. So that's how they knew what it was but at that time why the only way you could get in there was horseback. So they got on horses down in Moab, Edgar and Dan And Jess Johnson and they went down and staked that. Then they called old Fletch and Joe Cooper and Grant Bronson and
they was almost ashamed to tell anybody. They asked a thousand dollars for it. And so they got around there and finally old Joe took half of it you know. Fletch didn't have much money and Joe had saved his money. He had a little bit so he took half of it. And Grand raised 250 and Fletch had 250 so they acquired the Happy Jack Mine that way. And that thousand dollars I think somewhere around six or seven million they got out of it.
But they really kind of had a hard way to go to hold on
to that thing till it was worth it. SS: Oh you bet.
TK: Oh yes. Old Fletch every morning, when they was just starting in some of them tunnels on the outside there we lived in a tent down there. Every morning about daylight old Fletch would be up. He'd get up when you just barely could see him. He'd start firing the hole, firing the hole. Pretty soon why he'd have a round going on. Shoot
you know early in the morning.
SS: Well, I guess they didn't have a whole lot of choices
32

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
about, I mean aside from the contract about selling that ore it was so hard to get out I guess.
They wasn't loading out there. Hound Black stayed loading
for them here. They got the state to put up a little money and they hired some local tractors here and they pushed a road down there for the state you know. And they just, it wasn't a road really--it was just a jeep trail. That's the old road that was down there and that's the old road Cooper and Bronson hauled that copper ore out of there. That carload you know. They'd ship to Salt Lake. And of course even then why they didn't know what they was going to do with it. They was mad because it had uranium in it kind of you know. They really was.
TK:
I guess they could have been. It messed up their copper.
SS:
TK: But it's still good. They left some real high grade
copper down there. This Elmer Hurst and John Black see they leased it. They got the lease from Atlas control when Atlas brought TV on down there, they control it now. But they went back there just on a lease basis and found a rich ore or real rich deposit there and done all that for awhile.
SS: Oh boy, that's really been a bonanza hole hasn't it?
TK: Oh yeah. They went down there and had Isabelle Construction out of Phoenix come in there and they stripped that whole mine. Took a lot of them. They got
33

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
tunnels going back as far back they stripped oh, up there three of four hundred feet high and took off there but then there was still ore going back after that.
ss: I read somewhere that the Happy Jack ore was so rich that they never had any tailings, any bulk I mean.
TK: Oh no. It was all ore. It was coming right out the front. They never had any wasted. It was rich and lean places in there but it all averaged out.
SS: After VCA got their mill down there kind of a town grew up down in White Canyon didn't it. I'm especially interested in that town.
TK: Well, White Canyon is where most of the miners lived there and down at the mill they had a town down there. But Myron Free built a store down there, put in a trailer park and lots of people lived there and lots of prospectors come in there and lots of promoters you know and everybody. It was really a boom town. It was quite thrilling.
ss: It was kind of different from many of the other towns around here. Most towns around here were settled by the Mormons and all nicely planned out and but---?--
TK: Well this was just a thrown together store you know. I don't suppose old miners, he never done any planning at all. He just wanted something with a roof on it and something he could lock up you know, walls.
34

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
SS: Were there any permanent houses down there?
TK: No, there's no permanent house down there. Atlas
SS: TK:
Corporation come in there and took what we call Jacob's chair. They got all that there was all staked and left there. Well, no, that was Federal, the same outfit that bought us out. And they brought some portable houses in that you hauled. You just get them on a truck you know and then you just set them up. They have their own foundation and everything. Just set them on skids you know, skid and run and they were real, they were all self contained. They were all pretty well nice buildings. Then Colorado Oil Gas they tried a little low grade mill down there and they had quite a few families live there and they built one permanent house over there. But I don't know. I believe somebody bought it and moved it out of there.
I guess some people lived in tents down there.
Oh yeah tents, old Myron go around and buy all these little cheap trailer houses and bring them in and then he'd rent them see. I lived in one of them down there and down there it seemed it there were snakes all over there you know. They'd get in these trailers.
SS: What kind of snakes?
TK: Oh they were rattlesnakes, blow snakes and just what ever
kind come out.
35

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
SS: Well, all so far back in there, what did you do for
TK:
SS: TK:
SS:
TK:
SS:
TK:
entertainment?
Oh we didn't. We worked too hard. We'd just sleep for entertainment. We had a radio. Oh, they sold a little beer down there and a lot of the guys would sit there and drink beer half the day.
Did many of the men bring their families in?
Yeah, there were quite a few. There was an awful lot of them. In fact there was a lot of families there at one time.
Did they get any clubs going or did they have school --- ?---?
The county finally built a school down there and it's still there. I don't think they run it anymore but the school building is still there.
And it probably was, county built it. I guess the county paid the teacher.
Yeah, when they could get one. And sometimes when they didn't have one they'd just take anyone that was there you know. And have them teach the kids.
SS: Did the church have, did the church get organized out there do you know?
TK: No, I don't think there was any churches out there at all. No there were no churches. Of course I'm LDS. My church is here in town. I don't believe any church ever
36

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5 got out there.
SS: Was there, earlier you said there that it was kind of a boom town. Was there anything kind of special about the atmosphere or was it kind of wild.
TK: There was never really any wild stuff going on there. There was a lot of after the mine started you know, after the mines were there, there were probably more men there, I think probably wilder then than during the prospecting. You see, they had over Red Canyon, they had three mines,
four, five mines over there working and they had all men over there working. And then up on Five Point there was two mines up there and then there was the Happy Jack Mine and then there was several just prospect holes going on, you know, and a lot of guys around drilling you know. But a lot of these people, now, like, Radium King over there and the COG, Colorado Oil and Gas, they called it COG, why they had their own campsite up you know and these guys weren't actually in Fry, they'd just come in and buy their beer and their groceries and hang around there awhile and then go back wherever they come from. And then same way down there at the Happy Jack. And right around the Happy jack there was more mines than that too. Two or three mines there. Let's see, Bighorn had a place there they were mining. It never did turn out too good and then around on the Sunrise, there was a mine there, ---?---old
37

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
Ivan Hancock mined it. That's some of my old country and they got them off the Shumways you know. The Shumways had a hundred different shows in White Canyon, of uranium ore sticking out of the rock. And so really White Canyon didn't turn out near a big as it should have done you know from the show.
SS: You think there still is good ore back in there?
TK: Well, I think that there's some ore, they'll find some ore if they want, they'll pay it. Jeff Redd got property
there that produced ore again back in Red Canyon. And I think possibly a lot of this other property will produce ore, but the government quit buying and there's no market for it right now. These people that are selling these for power production and all they're asking is about two dollars a pound see, and the government was giving up to, five thirty hundredths over, was giving around three and a half a pound, plus 50 cents a pound development allowance, plus haulage allowance.
ss: Now they don't get haulage and they don't get any development. It's just.
TK: No. They're only offering about two dollars a pound is the way I understand it.
SS: That makes a difference.
TK: We got a lot of claims on Elk Mountain right now--me and
my partner over here, Reed. I mean there's a good 38

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
possibility of ore too. Of course we've got some low grade holes, you know, drilled. It costs a lot of money to drill holes.
How much does it cost to put down a test hole now?
Well it'll cost you about, depends on how deep you go--
SS:
TK:
SS:
TK:
it'll cost you around, if you just drill say, a hundred and fifty feet, you can probably get drilled for 75 cents on the foot.
But you have to drill quite a number of test holes to really be able to get a picture of what's there, don't you?
Oh yes, You've got to do, that's a big money deal--that drilling. You can just waste a fortune you know drilling and not have nothing you know. On the other hand you might be lucky like Steen and hit a hundred and twenty eight million on one hole.
Well, I guess that's what keeps people interested don't you think?
I guess.
Well, so you're holding your claims.
We're holding them hoping the future will be a lot better than the past.
Can you, could you name for me any of these people which you knew down in, that lived down in White Canyon that I'm looking for.
SS:
TK: SS: TK:
ss:
39

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
TK: Oh. You looking for some of them?
SS: Yeah, sure I am.
TK: Well, this head guy for COG, was the guy that was mine
boss he's around working for Kennecott in their big mine in Bingham now. His name's Bradford, K. Bradford. He was the in mine boss and then their engineer was Ross, Ross somebody. He started working for Colorado Oil and Gas. He was a geologist, engineer geologist for AEC, and then he quit AEC and went to work for Colorado Oil and Gas, down there. What was his name, Ross somebody. I can't remember his name. And one of the foreman down there. He's in California now. He's working down there in California in a steel fabricating outfit or something. Home Taylor, another guy that's down in California now. He worked out there for them. He was a miner out there. Kay Jones, he's in California. Probably find him in the phone book down there. He's down in that Los Angeles area.
SS: Well, that's possible.
TK: If you go back and see old Pep Prett, I bet he's even got
their phone number.
SS: Well that might be. He told me if I had some more
questions for him I could come back and ask him later. TK: If I'd jotted some of these names there, I knew practically everybody in that Cotton Camp there one time
there. At least by their first name. 40

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
SS: Well, I'll tell you what, if you think about it and one
of them comes to you just jot it down somewhere and leave a message for me over at Lee Shumways and I sure would love to get the names.
TK: Well, I really--there's a lot of guys you ought to get taped there. They do a lot better job than I could do.
[laugh]
SS: Well, let's see. Kind of going far into the night, but is
there something else that you'd like to tell me, something that really stands out in your mind that was exciting or anything like that?
TK: Oh, in prospecting there, why if you've never been prospecting, it's the most exciting thing, to prospect you know, and when you find something, in them days we didn't have a geiger counter that had a dial on it. We wore ear phones. We had these snickers and you'd get a narrow piece of uranium you know and it would just sound like it was going mad. You'd think that you was a millionaire and this is the most exciting thing. We'd be just overjoyed, you know. We'd find stuff you know and maybe we'd just hike up and down them mountains there you know and we'd just playing you know. We could race from one of the bottoms of those canyons clear to the top you
know. And then we'd have them earphones on you know, and we'd climb around in the brush you know and on those
41

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
steep side hills and under those ledges and you'd put that geiger counted down under there you know and you'd listen for it and pretty soon it would just go wild. And boy you'd just be so thrilled you know and you'd think,
"Oh boy, I've got it made now," and maybe you never even had any shipping grade ore but it would sound like it. But then course after awhile why they developed one strike geiger counters,and Bible geiger counters and I knew Gordon Bible. He's the guy that built that one you know--the Bible geiger counter. He's the guy that staked all these here, developed good mines north of Moab here that Shinarump formation just about seven mile there north of Moab.
SS: Oh up in Grant County?
TK: Uh huh. But the people that really made it are people
that got over there Charlie Steen. You probably heard
them stories a million times.
SS: Well, I've heard some versions.
TK: Well, old Charlie Steen you know, he kind of went
haywire, you know when it became evident, you know, that he really had it made. Old Cotton Robinson there in Moab run the barbershop and the boom was on and he was just a little small town barber you know and he had about 15 guys in there waiting to get a haircut, you know, and all of them about 30 days past due you know. So old Charlie
42

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
bounced in you know and just as old Cotton was getting through cutting one guy's hair, instead of waiting behind
SS: TK:
HK: SS: TK:
SS:
the line why he just bounced right in the chair right behind that guy. So old Cotton had to tell him to get out because it wasn't his turn. It made old Charlie mad and he jumped up and he says, "Charlie Steen waits for no man. " He went out and he got him, they had a 1i ttle, just south of town there they had a little airport out there, and he got his pilot there in that plane and they flew to Grand Junction to get him a haircut. Oh yes. Things was real exciting. I wish we could go through another uranium
boom. I think I'd do things a little different.
I wish we could just drum one up right now.
Yeah, I'm afraid we missed the boat. This is my boy Calvin, he wants to be uranium miner if the boom ever comes again. Hank this is Suzanne.
How do you do.
Glad to meet you.
She's from California and she's Gary Shumway's student
down there. She's up here trying to tape some of the things about the uranium boom. We though we had it made several times. We was disappointed.
You think you'd be interested in mining if it paid good money Calvin
CK: Well, my brother mined and he mined with the Shumways I
43

 THOMAS E . KEELE # 1 2 5
guess some of the most successful mines that I know of you know. You might not know too many of them but around town they are and I worked that way. I might go out and stake a few claims but I don't know if I'd invest a lot
SS: CK:
SS: TK:
CK:
TK:
CK: TK:
of money until something big came up like what Dad's got fixed up now.
Well, you kind of like to do a little prospecting though? Yeah. I guess everybody would you know. Get quick rich. I mean get rich quick.
There you go.
Well, prospecting here, the cheap way you know is with a geiger counter over the surfaces is all, over surfaces. Well, that's the only way you can really do it around here I mean because of the different formations and stuff you know.
So, now they have to drill, see all the places have been gone over.
Yeah. There's a few good ones I imagine someplace.
I don't think so. They did every spot. They go around in these airplanes you know, with a scintillator flying. Well, is there anything else you'd like to add?
No. It's been real nice talking to you Suzanne.
SS:
TK:
SS: Well, I'll tell you I've really enjoyed it and I think
we've got a good tape here and I certainly do thank you for your time and information.
44

 THOMAS E. KEELE #125
TK: I hope it turns out good. I hope I haven't ruined your
machine or anything. SS: Oh no.
[END OF TAPE]
