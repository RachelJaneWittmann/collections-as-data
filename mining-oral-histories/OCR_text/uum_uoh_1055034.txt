SS: W ell, Dr. Shumway, would you te l l
remembrances of the uranium industry from your father's association with it and on down?
GS: Yes, Dad had got totally involved in the uranium industry in 1931 when his next door neighbor came over with a piece of yellow rock that his sheepherder had brought in fram the Big Cottonwood area. The sheepherder had been out herding sheep in the canyon there for years, and apparently every time he took his group to this one spring he saw this outcropping of yellow rock. The longer he looked at it the more convinced he was that it was gold, and so he finally brought a piece in and showed it to Tom Jones, our neighbor across the road. Tom had brought it over to Dad who had had a long background in mining and interest in minerals. Dad told him that it wasn't
gold, but it was carnotite and that carnotite had uranium and vanadium in it and that there was a small market for it at that time in 1931 and the potential for a good market for it in the future. The stockman next door wasn't interested in mining at all , but t he sheepherder said that he would tell Dad where the deposit was in return for being s i nked in on the

claim. Dad and one of his brothers went into this area, walked into the Cottonwood area, looked all day for it and as you look out over that area you can understand how it would be almost impossible to find one little deposit at a spring. They came back and told the sheepherder that couldn't find it. He said,
"It's right down the very bottom of the creek, it had been up on the sides going along." He said, "It's right in the very bottom." So they went out the next day and got down in the bottom of the creek and started up looking for this. By the time they found that one deposit they'd found a number of other deposits. The creek was actually just--actually there was uranium leaching out all along the creek up through there, and they staked in the next few weeks 30 claims or so, the four brothers. So this got them then involved in the industry. Their older brother had been involved since 1912 and they had occasionally been up in Moab for Pete. Their older
brother was mining and had prospected and all.
SS: Then this was the background of interest in uranium that you mentioned earlier that your father had before '31. This association through his older
brother-in-law then?
ss: Well, I said he had interest in mining. Before this
2

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
he had been involved in gold mining up at the Dream Mine on Blue Mountain. My two oldest brothers were born in the gold mining camp up on Blue Mountain. Dad and Mom stayed up there their first few years and came down when the kids got old enough that they were
sliding down Blue Mountain in powder boxes and a few things like that. So they needed a little less dangerous atmosphere for raising children in. Dad had always had kind of a hobby of collecting minerals, of enj eying knowing about different minerals, and had certainly got the gold fever early in life. So all the rest of his life he had a few placer claims and he thought a good bushman's holiday was mining gold in his spare time. He had been involved in this, plus he had a few days work with his older brother in uranium mines up in Dry Valley north of Monticello. So he had learned to recognize carnotite and knew what was happening with it before then, but he had done--he had not become actively engaged in the uranium industry before 1931. Then
afterwards his whole life was the uranium industry. ss: Can you tell me something about this Dream Mine that
was on Blue Mountain?
GS: Not much. I never even thought about it as a matter
of fact, and this would be something I'd be 3

 DR.
GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
interested in knowing why it was named the Dream
Mine. There's got to be a Dream Mine in every mining, in every mining region, at least one Dream Mine and I'd be interested in knowing just why this was a Dream Mine. But Dad, I remember--
Did you know who located--?
Pardon?
Do you know who found the ore body?
No, I have the impression that Walter Lyman was someway involved in it. I may be completely wrong in this however, but I note that a few things that Dad had told me about it were that they had gone up there and worked on this. I know he said he ran a single jack, driving a single jack. Mom told me this, and that just after they got married and been up there, anyway, that Dad's arm when they were laying there at nights would just moving like this back and forth because it had all day long just been pounding a
piece of steel with a single jack like this to the point where his arm just moved like that at night. I guess he dreamed that he was still working and just sat there at night--
SS: GS: ss: GS:
ss: Or even his muscle spasms.
GS: Maybe. I guess it was quite a job, and I guess Dad
was very good at using a single jack. 4

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
SS: Do you suppose that this mine would have been located
in that area by these men through their work on the
tunnel, bringing water through onto the mesa--?
GS: It may well have been someway related to it, and I think this would be something worth following up on.
It may have been that they felt like the Lord had shown them this deposit of gold to pay for it for bringing the tunnel in. I know they felt like it was part of the destiny of the small town to have this tunnel through to provide the water that was so needed there. In some way it may well been have been related. My impression is that it was in some way related, but I may be completely wrong. Dad also worked on this tunnel for a number of years there and the two were possibly combined. Dad did tell me though that there were still places in there, in that old mine, when the last time he was there--I had forgotten this, but he told me years afterwards he
went out and went in the mine as it was already caving in and he had no business being in there. I mean it was far too dangerous to be in, but he crawled back through, and there were parts that were already caved-in, so he had to just slide in between lots of rocks to get in, in places. He got back there and he could see free gold, made of gold just
5

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
glistening there in places. Apparently fairly good 1ittle chunks of it so that you could have high graded the mine pretty well, that were showing in spots. He apparently had even considered doing that, but he was there, just being in there he could see the back beginning to buckle, you know. He slid back down out of it and never went in again. I don't think that you could go in now. There was a fair 1ittle tunnel driven back into the side there.
SS: Would you have any idea what value of gold might have been taken out of there?
GS: No, but apparently it was low enough in total, you know, in total production that they didn't continue it. I would suspect in order for it to be that low it must have been--I don't know, but probably not much over 12 dollars a ton or those people who so desperately needed work, you know, would have kept it up I suspect. My impression is that the ore was quite low.
SS: Well, perhaps to continue on with your father's involvement with the uranium industry after 1931--did he begin development, he and his brothers begin
development on the Cottonwood claims right away or
how did that proceed?
GS: They shipped a little ore mostly just for showing how
6

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
much there was there and the quantity of it. Apparently for example, in 1932 Bob Sterling of VCA at a time when Vanadium Corporation of America had no active production for the Colorado Plateau, Mr. Sterling heard about this and came from Boulder, Colorado where the VCA I guess had some molybdenum deposits. I'm not sure, but he came out, took a long
careful look, and the Shumway brothers shiped oh, I guess two or three tons or two or three thousand pounds of ore that went very good. As I recall, the least of the shipments was made five percent I believe of vanadium and about that in uranium. They had good enough deposits and rich enough ore that the VCA was quite interested in it at that time. However as far as production, really getting it into production, there was no market whatsoever for vanadium ore, for custom ore outside of what Union Carbide would be producing shortly after. They weren't even producing on the Colorado Plateau until 1934, and Dad and his brothers did high grade a little rich uranium and sell it to Howard Balsely in 1934, beginning in 1934 and after that. But they kept
the claims for a few years and then sold them for almost nothing. I think they sold them for almost $1,500, the whole group of claims there, and got a
7

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
pair of boots and saddle out of it or something like that. I know they jokingly said afterwards that's all they got out of it, but they did get a little money too. They sold it to an L.D. Hunter I believe in Castle Canyon, Utah. He then sold it to a Frank Garbitt in Los Angeles who was a movie producer, and Garbitt then leased them to the VCA after that. Bob Anderson of the VCA, superintendent in Naturita was telling me the other day that I would be surprised how many million dollars had been taken out of there. I had assumed the production had been somewhat limited; I mean in comparison with other areas, but he said it was one of the best producers this group that Dad and them started on in 1931. As far as production for the claims early, their production was minimal.
ss: Just what claim names are involved out there in Cottonwood?
GS: Oh, let's see. The Birthday and the--well, there's a problem with the claims in that there was an official name of the claims and then there was the name that to be certain, part of the claim--that the certain tunnel--actually, I got afterwards and I knew most of them as this for example: the South Stinking Hole as it was called was probably a part--I'm not sure of
8

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
what claim it would have been. It may have been the Birthday claim or the Spring claim. I'm not sure, but there were a whole bunch of little holes that went
in, you know, little tunnels driven in. Each one of them had a different name. The Big Hole for example which everyone knows about. I mean, it was one of the big, big deposits and the big success hole, everybody's found there. It was actually part of the East Bank claim on the east side of the creek and yet everyone knows of it as the Big Hole. They would refer to it as the Big Hole claim really. But there was the Badger and the Birthday and the East Bank and the Ridge and Cheese and Raisin. Of course that was on down, and the Lonesome--and of course on down too was the Butler. And the Dinosaur group. In the general areas, in the larger general areas.
ss: Do all of these claims date from the original 1931 staking or did they in fact go back and restake or do additional staking at later dates?
GS: They did both additional staking and restaking apparently. I don't know how expensive this practice was on this group of claims, but on many of their claims and on most of persons' claims who were prospecting at this time, when you had to do a
hundred dollars worth of assessment work every year 9

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
in order to retain a claim, and when there were long periods when there was no hope, almost no hope of claims ever being worthwhile both as a means of escape and the necessity of doing a hundred dollars work, and also as simply as a second thought afterwards that there maybe some importance to it, there was a great deal of relocating claims that had been staked earlier. Sometimes even the same people relocating them, so there were claims where perhaps Dad and Uncle Harris had been in on the original staking of them and then four or five years later you would find that Dad and Uncle Seth had their name on some claims, or Uncle Lee and Uncle Harris had their names on the claims. Meaning that in this interim the original stakers had decided that it wasn't worth the hundred dollars worth of work they had to do. Then someone else would come and decide that it was and
take it up, I mean it was worth putting the dollars
into relocating the claim, and they would do that.
SS: In this particular area did many other people other
than the Shumways come in and stake in Cottonwood?
GS: Not very many at this time. I just thought of something too in finishing this. There was some
staking too, some discoveries made at a later date. These Bank claims I think were discovered in 1938 or
10

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
'39, several years after the earlier ones had when
Uncle Lee and Uncle Harris were out there working. I think it was even after they had sold. Well, it was after they had sold the other claims and they were just working on the claims and they were sitting there eating their lunch and looked across and they noticed that the water had eroded for some reason under the bank on the other side. They got wondering why it would erode so easily underneath there, under the sandstone. They got over there and got right down in the water and looked under and they could see the high grade back in there, in the cave, the high grade showing up. So they diverted the stream there and had the water run the other way and then dug down through the sand in the bottom of the creek and found there was a large face of beautiful, beautiful high grade. I've seen pictures of this as they were there just exposing the face, and even on a black and white picture you can see just how rich the ore was there that they found just outcropping on the East Bank claim. It became known as the Big Hole. So there was some later staking. As a matter of fact, I can recall
going with Dad and Uncle Seth when I was a young boy, which must have been in 1942 or '43, going down the creek with them on down from the claim that they had
11

 DR .
GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
originally staked. I remember going along and Dad told me what to look for, called them buds of carnotite, they just looked like little spring flowers, little beautiful, beautiful yellow flowers that he said it would look like. As we were going along, sure enough we saw these just little chips in the sandstone rock looking underneath the ledges
close to the bottom of the creek there. We just all of a sudden saw a bright, bright yellow carnotite bud, and this was years after they had staked their original claims. Ten or 15 years afterwards.
Ah.
You asked me another question there that I never finished.
Oh, I asked you about other people coming into the Cottonwood area in the early years.
There were a few people interested besides the Shumways in this area. As a matter of fact, when I
was young, growing up, I was very conscious that the Shumways were a strange kind of people because they didn't work for the WPA or didn't work for the CCC or anything else. They spent their time out in the hills prospecting and there was a distinct feeling that they were strange as a result of that. There were a few people who during 1932 and 1944 when the Metals
SS: GS:
ss:
GS:

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
Reserve was in, staked some claims. Some of them even a little earlier than this, largely because of speculation and very often without any ore body being present. There were also a few others who had staked
in by the Shumways for grubstake reasons or for other reasons. For example, Marvin Lyman was one of the people who I remember was fairly sympathetic to Dad's and his brother's ventures and he supplied them a number of times with the gas and oil and upkeep on their pickups that they would need in return for being staked in on a claim, at a time when there didn't appear to be any great potential, value of some of these claims. He for a tankful of gas would be staked in, and beyond that he was a very fine person and close friend. Dad, I didn't know this until very recently, but Dad and Marvin Lyman had been as young people--those two and a man by the name of Wally Galbraith had been such close friends that they had been almost inseparable in growing up and I have never known this. I think this has carried over then and has carried over in my generation and has carried over into my son's generation with Kelly Lyman who is a grandson of Marvin Lyman. There were friendship reasons, but also I think Marvin was interested enough in the possibility of the industry
13

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
that he was taken in a number of times.
ss: Well, you speak about a feeling of differences within the community or perhaps skepticism of your family's interest in the minerals. Was this a real hardship for you as a young boy growing up, this feeling of difference?
GS: I don't know how much it was. There were some stresses and strains in the community that I felt without knowing it, and I probably explained a number of things that I didn't totally understand at the time. There was in the community the old Hole in the Rock fine elite sophisticated and truly aristocratic people. They were good people and fine people and cultured people and all. Then there were the Mexican Mormons who had come in; who had gone to Mexico for religious reasons, had got fairly well settled in northern Mexico and then in the revolution of 1910 had been forced, I believe, in 1911 to leave there and flee without anything, just grab what they could and leave right then. They left all of their earthly
possessions in Mexico and then spent a good part of a year I guess hoping to be able to return to their homes. They must have used up any remaining assets that they had before the Church finally advised them to find roots elsewhere because it didn't look like
14

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
there was going to be an early opportunity to go back. A large number of them had come to our small town and had provided a great population boom in the town. The town was for most purposes divided between the Mexican Mormons and the Hole in the Rock Mormons. I mean you were either one or the other. The Shumway family didn't belong to either group. They had come in before the Hole-in-the-Rock, before the Mexican Mormons. Just as the town was being established, the town of Blanding was being established my grandfather was 12 or 14--I can't remember which. He had come in and settled just south of the town, spent a year or two down there and then had moved into town, so the family didn't belong to either of these two groups and the town where there were very definite almost clan relationships set up. We didn't have the protection or the support or the sympathy of either group. Now it wasn't a vicious kind of thing. In most cases at least it wasn't even a conscious kind of thing, and by the time that I was old enough to sense these things much of it had dissipated also, so there
wasn't the opening antagonism or resentment between the Hole in the Rockers and the Mexican Mormons. There had indeed been earlier. At any rate the fact that the Shumway family didn't belong to either group
15

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
sort of accentuated it, and the fact that we also didn't belong economically to either group. We weren't either farmers or cattlemen. At least very successfully were farmers or cattleman, and mining may have been just a little bit much down in on Mormon society anyway. In early times Brigham Young had told the members of the Church not to spend their time looking for mineral deposits, that he could tell a millionaire in prospect when he saw one of these battered prospectors coming in. That's the way they would remain, would be a millionaire in prospect and that the Saints were to involve themselves with the tilling the soil and building up the kingdom and not be concerned with other things. Some of this, even though it had been 75 years since that suggestion was made, some of it may have come through so that the mining wasn't quite as respectable or quite as advisable an occupation for Mormons to be engaged in. So that all of these things may have had, unconsciously may have influenced the social environment in which the young Shumway generation
grew up in.
SS: Uh huh. For what reasons did you grandfather come to
Blanding?
GS: Well, my great grandfather had been a member of the
16

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
Council of Fifty in the Church hierarchy. He had been one of the staunch saints in the early days of the Church and he had come to Salt Lake with the pioneer band of 143 men and 2 women or whatever it was. When he got to Salt Lake he, because had had been on the
frontier all of his life and because he had some of the kind of skills that few of the saints did have for actually pioneering, he was asked by Brigham Young, not just one time as so many of them were, but I think five times in his life to move, be in on the pioneering facet of settlement. First to Sanpete County and settling Manti, what's Manti, Utah now, and then to I think the Cache Valley in northern Utah. Then to Star Valley, Wyoming, I believe, and then to Preston, Idaho, then to southern Utah, around Kanab, and then finally to northern Arizona and he died in a little town named after him, named Shumway, Arizona, near Taylor and Snowflake, Arizona. His life--I mention this because his whole life was dedicated to the Church in this way, in building up
the kingdom, in putting up the outer corridor for Zion. He had played a somewhat prominent role by doing this, but at the same time his--there was little opportunity for the kind of economic buildup that some of those saints [had] who refused those
17

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
calls and stayed in Salt Lake and got filthy rich off the gold rush or Johnson's army, the refuse of Johnson's army when they left and left everything there. Some of these good fine saints in Salt Lake had much greater cultural opportunities and economic opportunities. My grandfather almost literally crawled out of the hills really with his brood of half-educated and half-wild destroying angels. My grandfather and his brothers then had little
opportunity for really much of an economic stake in the beginning. He and my grandmother married, did not have much of a nest, and they moved from northern Arizona to northern New Mexico. My father was born in territorial Arizona and went to school in territorial New Mexico and they were not very successful in either place financially. I can't remember, with 12 or 14 children to support and with very little estates. They were having struggles, so they left northern New Mexico hoping to better themselves economically in southeastern Utah, which ultimately they did of course. When they came they were very
poor and--oh, I've seen early pictures of the family and Uncle Seth I noticed, I asked him why he had those things over his feet. It looked like he had taken sage brush or something and put over his feet
18

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
when the picture was taken. He said he did this because he was ashamed because they didn't even have a pair of shoes to give him to put on while the picture was taken and he didn't want to have a picture taken barefoot, so he had covered up his feet with brush you know in the picture. They've all got
terribly long hair and look like they've crawled out of a coyote den or something, but this was the reason they came to southeastern Utah was to benefit, to better themselves. They settled on this little ranch at Fiddler's Green down in Recapture [Wash] south of Blanding, lived there a couple of years and weren't apparently much more successful there than they had been in New Mexico. Then they came into town and really had little of a sound economic base between then and the time they got involved in mining, which was from 1910 till 1931. I wonder how they did survive in those in-between years or for 20 years after that.
ss: Were they farming?
GS: Yes, they farmed a little and they homesteaded there.
They took out a homestead of 160 acres and had some cattle running there, a few cattle. By that time there were almost no demands for cattle.
ss: Well, you yourself had, were more or less born into 19

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
the interest in minerals.
GS: Yes, my earliest recollections, the earliest things that I can recall, probably the earliest thing I can recall at all is very vague recollection, and I know it is a recollection and not just what other people have told me because I can remember things that they couldn't possibly have known about it. It was the experience of being lost. I wasn't lost, I was prospecting, but everybody else in town thought I was lost. My older brother and his girlfriend had gone out poaching deer, and as we were driving along--they had invited me along or I had insisted on going with them and maybe I was the chaperon or something, I'm not sure--but we were going along and DeVarr saw a deer [run] across the road and run down off the big cliff, so he stopped the car and they got out with a gun and went over and started following it to shoot it. They got down and followed it quite a ways and shot the deer and then had to dress it out and all. I was there in the car and they had, when they left they had locked the two doors assuming that as a small child of barely three I wouldn't be able to open the locks on the doors, you know, pull them up.
While they were gone I strained and pulled on them until I got one of the 1ocks up on the door and
20

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
opened the door and decided while they were gone I would go prospecting. I had hear Dad tell about prospecting and finding high grade minerals. So I took off and I went along and I remember I'd stop and break a rock and look at it and say, "Nope, not high grade," and go on. After an hour or so DeVarr and
Phoebe came back and I wasn't there. They called and shouted and waited around and then started following my tracks, but on the rimrocks 1ike it was--there just weren't any tracks left after a while. They spent quite a while looking for me before they had to--and I'm sure they very much hated to do this--I can imagine what kind of a response they were met by as they went back to town and admitted that they had
been gone somewhere long enough for me to get lost. They had to go into town and they blew the siren and had everybody in town come out and spend the day looking for me. In the meantime I was out prospecting. I went along and prospected and
prospected and finally in the afternoon I remember I had fallen down, I had started down a Brushy Basin slope there, Brushy Basin Clay, and had slipped and slid down it on my nose and I had skinned all my nose and it had been bleeding and I had blood all over me and wasn't too happy about things. I had stopped and
21

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
got me a drink of water down in the creek and had wandered on and on and later in the afternoon it started getting quite late as a matter of fact. I started getting quite worried about things and I was shouting and hollering. Finally I found a big old hole going back in the cliff, just a natural erosion back in, and I could look back in there and I decided I'd crawl back in there and sleep that night back in there since I didn't have anyplace else to sleep. I started to get in there and then just as I started back in, I thought, "Well, that might be a bear hole or there may be snakes back in there." I remember it must be a snake hole is what I decided, and I decided not to and I sat down under a tree there, and I was
just sitting there softly crying to myself when all of a sudden I saw a guy coming and I thought he was an Indian. As I looked at him I thought he was an Indian coming. I thought I 'd had it for sure, so I hid underneath the other side of the tree, hid there and was there real quietly. All of a sudden the first thing I knew someone just reached down and grabbed me and I looked up and it was Leo Black. He had been out, one of the search party, and he had seen me from quite aways off and had come over and got me. He put
me on his shoulders and went in shouting, "I found 22

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
him. I found him." I got back in and that was my first prospecting experience. I mention this because
it does show the kind of orientation my life was taking. The other experiences I can recollect of my very early life were after this going with Dad out to the Cottonwood mines where he was working. He had a horse-drawn cart that he would pull back, and he and- -I remember one time Miss Richenburger was working with him and they'd be back in there working away. Miss Richenburger was a kind old German who had fled- -I think Germany or maybe Switzerland, I'm not sure-- but had come there to our town, and he didn't speak very good English and I had a hard time understanding, but I kind of enjoyed being in the mines with him. I remember Dad--and I suspect this happened with most of the young boys at this time, Dad would keep me occupied while I was out there at the mines, he gave me an old powder box, a dynamite box, a wooden box and showed me a little tiny, very thin seam of high grade ore. It was very high grade but it was also so thin that it wasn't worth mining. To blow up the whole cliff just to get this little seam out wasn't worth it. So I'd sit there and pick away on that with his little pick and I'd pick away on that and get the soft ore out and put it in my
23

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
dynamite box and I would try and get my box filled by the time he went in and mucked out one of the big carts. He came out and I would just toss whatever I had, whether it was full or not on top of the load of ore. Dad used to look at that and he would tell me, he said, "Gary, that dynamite box with your high grade is probably worth just as much as this whole cart of my ore". I used to just work like mad to--I
remember doing this, working like mad at this little high grade seam on the South Stinking Hole claim there, but I remember how much I loved to go down with Dad to the mines. It was a great experience to be out there and Dad, I guess, enjoyed having me enough that he would throw in a big, big sack of these old fashioned ginger snaps, sacks of cookies. Dad 1ived mainly on beans and bread, he had just taken some pork and beans and put it on a piece of bread and (would] eat that and a few other things
that weren't especially attractive, enticing food, but he'd always throw in a big sack of these ginger snaps and put it in the bottom of the big wooden barrel that he had there. You had to put your food in the barrel because the packrats were so bad there. The packrats would carry off all your food and hide it in places around and carry off anything else that
24

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
was left just sitting around. They'd put i t--you 'd
find it somewhere else underneath some shelf on something. He'd put these ginger snaps in the barrel and let me dig down through there to get to them. I remember one time Dad invited me to go with him when he was driving old Maude, our old work plug. Old Maude became a part of the family and something that the young generation of Shumways felt so strongly towards. Old Maude was just part of the family and she was a very, very smart horse. She was smart enough that you didn't even have to give her orders in the mine. A mining horse, you know, gets to the point that they get pretty smart, and you could take her in and she'd know right where to go, how to stop, how to back up the cart right where she should be, stop right in front of the muck down, fill it up. As soon as it was through she'd take [it] on [up]. I think she probably could have done it by herself and gone out and dumped her own cart, really. But she would back up to the bin and stop just at the perfect place for you to dump the ore in, you know. I remember this experience of driving Maude, going out with Dad to the mines, from Blanding out there. It took us all day to get out there in the cart. We rode
in the cart as Maude was pulling us. Dad and I-- 25

 DR. SS: GS:
GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
The same cart that would be used in the mines?
Yes. I always look back on this experience because it was a time when Dad and I had quite a bit of time to visit with each other. The trip did take us all day long, and I remember there was a big horsefly that kept 1ighting on Maude 's back. Dad would take the reins and slap it off and he was concerned that that horsefly was giving her quite a bit of trouble. Oh,
it was a fun day to have going over that old bumpy road to the mines.
When you were going out to Cottonwood, it was an all- day trip, then how long would you stay?
We'd stay all week long.
You'd stay the week?
Yes. I remember Dad had an old 32-30 rifle, he had a dog that was a sharp dog, just a bright dog. All you'd have to do is say "sic 'em," to some cows and or she would take off and round them up. She also was the only that I'd ever seen that would do this. She was just a mongrel dog, but she loved to hunt ducks, just loved to. Dad and I would go out fairly early in the morning. There was an old mill pond there at the
mines and there were ducks on the mill pond in the morning. Dad and I would go down there and sneak up to a bank real quietly and shoot one of the ducks.
SS:
GS: SS: GS:
26

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
Then old Puffy, the dog, would take off, and run out there, swim out in the water and get the duck and bring it back to us. I just loved this. I used to
just wait for morning to come so that we could go down there and shoot at the ducks. They're just wild ducks, you know, flying in. Dad tried to make it interesting for me. There was an old man there named Old Chandler, Old Chandler as we called him who became a part of everyone's early life I think. He had been born in the gold mining camps of Alaska and had spent his early days in gold mining in Alaska and then had come down when the--I don't know when he came down actually. Whether he had come down during the radium boom or came down just about this time, but he came down and he located a couple of claims, rather worthless claims next to Dad's out in Cottonwood. He was always there with his long drooping mustache and his anarchist hat as we--you know, think of these 1ittle caps that foreigners sometimes wore. He would play the banjo in the evenings for us out there. He'd come over to Dad's little cabin there often in the evenings and he'd play the banjo and sing old gold mining songs of Alaska and sit around and talk to Dad. I remember I was always scandalized because he smoked and I
27

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
thought that any self-respecting person shouldn't be smoking, you know, but he was quite a delightful old man with lots of stories to tell and interesting
stores. He always kind of went out of his way to
make the kids feel entertained around him.
ss: He was mining, he was mining some below average
claims there?
GS: Yes, yes, Chandler. I don't even know how he even
obtained these claims. He may have been leasing. He probably was as a matter of fact only leasing them from VCA who now owned the mining block of claims there, but he had drilled the tunnel in--I remember we called it Chandler's hole there. He drilled it high off the contact and had it running right back in the middle of a big cliff there. You saw that hole as a matter of fact out when we went to Cottonwood. I recall he had just a big piece of culvert or something that he'd bring in the ore out in, or the rock, whichever it was--out in a wheelbarrow and dump it down. It would run down that down to the bottom, and I guess that's the way he planned on loading his trucks. I don't know that he ever got enough production out of it to load any trucks. But he did work at that and a little placer gold mining and not too hard at any of it as I recall. He was an old
28

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
elderly man and not too well and he just loved being there, but I recall shortly after this or when I was a little older, one winter he came to the door in the early winter and Mom opened the door. He knocked and Mom opened the door and he just almost just fell in he was so far gone from pneumonia that he was almost
dead. He could hardly even breathe. His 1ungs were filled so full. He could hardly talk or anything. So Mom set him up a bed right in our front room there and all winter long, that winter he stayed there and several winters after that with mom just welcoming him in and nursing him back to health every winter. In the spring he'd get better and go out and go wherever he wanted. He may even disappear until there'd come that knock on the door again and there he'd be back with the same kind of problem. I don't know, Mom always showed him a great deal of respect and consideration, kind of Christian charity I suspect, but she made him feel welcome and never, "Oh no, here's Chandler back," you know. But one winter finally he was gone and he didn't show up. He didn't come, and he'd been down at White Canyon now. As a matter of fact he'd been there for some years. He had
a little gold mining operation right under the road, the White Canyon road down there. He had him I guess
29

 DR.
GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
a little bit of colors showing and he didn't come in this winter, and didn't come in and some people were going out to White Canyon. I think Uncle Seth, I can't remember, somebody--and they went out there and
found him dead out there. He just hadn't made it in. He'd died of pneumonia and it was at that time we learned he had a son in Alaska who was contacted. He come down and attended the funeral and we learned that he had had a family. We'd never known anything about his personal life at all, but he had had a family and his son was quite a fine person, quite a well-educated person as I recall. We were quite
impressed with him as an individual.
But that was the first that you had known of his family at all?
That was the first that I had ever been aware of that he ever did have anybody concerned about him.
To go back for just a minute, you mentioned when you were talking about your first prospecting experience that you were fearful that the person you saw coming might be an Indian. Was that just a child's fear or was there good reason to be fearful of being found out alone like that?
No, there wasn't. If it would have been an Indian he
would have treated me as kindly as would have anyone 30

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
else would have done. There was no problem. I perhaps--(Break in tape) No, and it may have been
just maybe from the impression that maybe that's the reason DeVarr and Phoebe left me out there. They wanted to give me to the Indians or something.
SS: Another thing that impressed me about that story that you told was that even at that early age you had been impressed with the kind of excitement that must have been generated in your household whenever some of this good ore was found.
GS: Uh huh.
SS: Can you relate something of that feeling?
GS: I remember a few vague things. I remember one time
Dad--(phone rings).
SS: You were telling me about remembering these very
exciting times when your father would come in with
good ore that he had found.
GS: I remember one time him bringing in some red oxide,
which is very high grade vanadium. He brought this in a little seamless sack, a small sample sack. It wasn't too small. It probably would have held five pounds. He showed that to me and was obviously very excited about it. I remember even, I was on a program in primary, in a church children's program, and I was an Indian. He used this red oxide for putting on the
31

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
war paint on me you know. I'm not too sure how healthy it was now, but it was excellent war paint. Just excellent. I recall the first samples that they got back from White Canyon when they'd went down to White Canyon to prospect. They got the assays back
and they went something like 15 percent or something like that. When Dad got that assay back he was so excited that he just jumped up and said, "What a red," and went running out to tell, running down to tell Lee and Uncle Harris and Seth about it. It was quite exciting to him I recall. I can recall throughout life different assays coming back and also of some of his discoveries. The early ones--this is all I can recall as far as him mentioning this--that I know from a number of different times I must have gotten the impression that prospecting was something terribly engaging and something worth spending your time doing instead of hunting deer or something.
SS: What can you tell me about your experience of going into White Canyon to prospect?
GS: Well, in 1943 I guess it was, I believe their first-- well, there are several different ways, and I've even heard the story from several different sources in different ways that they did become interested there, but there were several things that must have led them
32

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
there. One, they had by then become involved in some mining on the reservation where there were some beautiful huge deposits in the Shinarump formation. If you look at a map even though you don't realize
it, White Canyon is fairly close to the reservation. You know, it doesn't seem like it, but it isn't far away and they knew that there was Shinarump formation from geological maps. You could see that there was Shinarump formation exposed all up and on through the White Canyon, Red Canyon area and and [they] also read Gregory, Herbert Gregory's report I think of 1933 when he had done a reconnaissance through there. He had reported--I remember Dad telling me this when I was little--that Gregory had reported that there were uranium salts in the old copper diggings at the Happy Jack Mine. Now uranium salts are very high grade mineralization. I mean actual crystals of uranium, which means they're very high grade, and these were present in the Happy Jack. So they knew from this source that there was uranium there. Then too Wiley Redd had--and this must have been another source of i t--W iley Redd had been the caretaker at [Natural] Bridges in Upper White Canyon, and in going from there up to Elk Mountain and home over the trails that went from down there, he apparently had
33

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
found some salt with copper showing in it at the bottom of one of the telescopes there, that would be Moenkopi at the bottom but Shinarump up higher on the ledge. From what Uncle Seth told me when I was young and down White Canyon with him, apparently he, Wiley, had looked for this deposit and couldn't find it, assuming it was down there, and he had looked along for it and couldn't find it. Finally he came to Uncle Seth and said there was some ore there and showed him some pieces of the ore. It was lovely ore, and Uncle Seth had then agreed to go out with him and find it. Uncle Seth and Wiley Redd had gone out and found the deposit that became known as the Hideout Mine, a fabulous deposit. Uncle Seth told me and I'm not sure how good Wiley Redd had ever felt about this, but Uncle Seth said he knew when he saw that just what a good claim it was. He just didn't bother sounding very excited about it to Wiley, and they staked the claim. Uncle Seth waited a year or so and then came to Wiley and I think said, "I'll give you five hundred dollars for your interest in it." Wiley said, "Okay." Uncle Seth was very thrilled about getting it. Uncle Seth's a businessman from the word go, I found in a number of ways.
SS: So he realized that it was a tremendous deposit but
34

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1 just played it cool--
GS: Yeah, he just didn't sound overly thrilled about it apparently until he had--and this is what he told me. This is exactly how he approached the whole thing, that he knew from the beginning how good it was. Of course Uncle Seth didn't get much out of it either because even though he had not planned on including
this in the sale when the White Canyon claims were sold, he found out when they sold these to Fennel Sitton, when they got over there to sign the papers, when he was reading it over he saw the White Canyon, I mean the Hideout claim as well as the claims that were listed on there and he told Fennel that those claims wasn't supposed to be in on there and that Fennel had misunderstood this. Fennel said, "Well, it's there, let's just leave it there since it's there because it needs to be there," and you know Uncle Seth I guess wasn't overly happy about it, but at least I heard from one person that his brothers were so fearful that Fennel wouldn't go ahead with the two hundred thousand dollars if it wasn't included, that they put a little pressure on him to not sweat the small stuff. So it was kept in on the deal so he didn't get much out of it anyway. Perhaps Wiley got the better deal out of it, as a matter of
35

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1 fact .
ss: There were some other instances of rivalry between the Redd family and the Shumway family.
GS: Yes, uh huh. At the same time Dad and them apparently from other sources were deciding that White Canyon, Red Canyon should be a profitable area for prospecting. They had been prospecting on the Morrison formation up to this time. Prospecting in Cottonwood and in the Butler and in Recapture [Wash],
lower Recapture and extensively in Montezuma and had gone to many other known areas for prospecting around. Then in the early 1940s with the Metals Reserve program going on and the great emphasis on production they had began looking at other areas and had decided to go down to the White Canyon, Red Canyon areas. But at the same time Pat Redd and his father Wiley had been given information on this country from other source. Pat Redd had spent a few winters probably down with John Weatherall on the reservation at Kayenta where John Weatherall (who was a great early explorer and prospector and archeologist in the area) had a trading post and knew most of the country around. John Weatherall had told him after some unfortunate experiences in trying to get into the mining industry on the reservation that
36

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
he knew a deposit off the reservation would be a good deposit, and this apparently was the introduction that Pat had to the Red Canyon area. He went then having been told by Weatherall where there was a deposit at almost the same time that Dad and them were deciding to prospect there. As a matter of fact, apparently they arrived there so nearly the same time and started looking at some of the same deposits that there was a good hardy rivalry that developed that could have developed into more than a rivalry for a while. It was an honest rivalry apparently with both of them having learned of this area and determined to go into it at the same [time]. Probably neither of them was overly careful about putting up corner posts and maybe even recording your claims after they had them staked or being sure that they did the assessment work, etc. But yes, there was a healthy rivalry for a year or so and it was worked out probably because they were all, I think, honorable people and wanted to do the honest thing,
instead of beating, one group beating the other out
of the property.
ss: Well, now as you've mentioned there were some pretty
definite indications that the Shinarump was going to be a good area of mineralization for uranium, but in
37

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
actuality it wasn't recognized as such for quite some time. I mean the four senior Shumway brothers were the first, apparently, perhaps excluding John Weatherall, to actually realize that the uranium was there in the Shinarump.
GS: I suspect if you went back and talked to some of those old prospectors almost every one of them would say now that they had known that there was uranium there, but there was also high grade copper. As a matter of fact there's a good deal of activity right now with copper at 60 cents a pound in this country, beginning operations of mining copper. The copper is just high enough grade there and enough of it in some of these places that there are some beginning interests there again in this. There had been copper attempts--every time I guess the price of copper was just right there would be another attempt made to mine this for many years, and there had been men there in that area who had been interested in this. The Happy Jack, the people, the Hayes family
who had this and even some who had had it earlier than this had looked at the Happy Jack as a copper prospect and not uranium. Although Dan Hayes told me that he had known definitely that there was uranium there; that he had picked out little marble sized
38

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
bills of uranium, almost pure uranium he said, out of there that came in little nuggets in the mine. Most of the activity had been for copper, although people probably recognized uranium also in there.
SS: Uh huh. I think there was some--especially along the river--placer mining, gold mining.
GS: Yes, there had been gold mining in the sandbars along the river, yes.
SS: But until the early '40s period I think this probably was the first effort to--that would motivate strictly out of, more or less by the uranium instead of the
other minerals that are present there.
GS: I'm not even sure but what part of the motivation
even then wasn't copper. As a matter of fact it may have been even the major motivation. Some of these claims that were staked were almost pure copper and almost no uranium, and yet they were staked with a good deal of enthusiasm, and some of the claims for example, even that the Redds staked, they said they were staking them for copper. Now, I asked Pat Redd, Preston Redd about this, and he seemed to think that they were staking them for uranium but that it was-- there were some problems with claiming that you were staking them for uranium at this time, which may be true. I know that there was a time between '46 and
39

 DR .
GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
late '48 where there was a good deal of uncertainty as to whether a uranium claim was legal. So you might stake a claim and say you were staking it for vanadium or for copper ore or lead or silver or something else. But, I think probably even in this period when both of the groups were down prospecting, I think some of the claims at least probably were copper claims at that time.
SS: Now in the early '4Os they would have been staking more or less by the outcropping without the use of the geiger counter.
GS: Yes, they didn't have a geiger counter at that time, and what they would do, I went with Dad down while I was quite young as he was staking. It must have been in the late '40s. We would go along, what they would do is look from quite a ways off, look over across the country and somehow they could tell where there were channels. I hate to admit this, but I can look at that same country, even now when it's been mined and all, and I have an awful hard time seeing channels, but they thought they could see these old Paleo stream channels that they had discovered. I
think that Dad and them were the first ones to really apply this knowledge of one connection between Paleo stream channels cutting down into the Moenkopi and
40

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
uranium deposits. They would stand off quite a ways and look, at least there they thought there were channels showing and at least they could cut out a lot of country where they could see that the Shinarump just wasn't thick at all and there were no
indications of any possibility of mineralization. Then they would go over to these likely points and they would go along below it and see that there's a whole telescope of maybe of, oh, four hundred feet of Moenkopi before you get to the Shinarump, and if you spend much time going up over those telescope rocks with big chunks of Wingate that's fallen off the top and all of this rubble you know, all of it down off the cliff. If you spend much time scampering up there to check everyone of these and then down and over to check another one of them, you'll wear your tail off you know. So what they would do would be to go along at the bottom and they would check the rocks that had come off the Shinarump formation. They would just look for pieces of Shinarump formation down on the telescope, down at the bottom. They would break these rocks when they would find a piece of Shinarump, they would break it open and look for just a speck of copper. I remember one day going with them along and they found just one little speck of copper in one of
41

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
those. As soon as they found that speck of copper they went up and they knew they had a good deposit. They went up and sure enough there was copper leaching out on the rocks and then of course uranium also. But there you would look for copper as an indication and there was an association between the copper and uranium. This type of prospecting probably, however, kept Dad and them out of some of the more important discoveries because they, in doing it this way, they very often were looking at highly oxidized deposits, finding them in this way and also deposits that were rather shallow with very little Wingate on top of it, you know, overburden on it.

 [ T H I S I S THE CONTINUA TION OF AN INTER VIEW WITH DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY BY SUZANNE SIMON A T ANAHEIM, C A L IFORNI A ON AUGUST 31, 1970 FOR THE URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT. TAPE #1.]
GS: So much of the ore was of an oxidized variety that I guess it was hard to mill for one thing. Also often these buttes there were so thin that there wasn't much--even if you had a channel running through it wasn't too far between one s i de and t he other side of one of these for mining. Of course they did discover a number of the great deposits down there also. But they spent a lot of time on deposits that never did prove out to be so important and left others. If they would have just staked one row of claims behind the ones that they staked for example or a few rows back like any person would do now they would have included a number of important deposits they missed otherwise.
SS: Well, when your Uncle Seth and J. Wiley Redd did find and locate the Hideout Mine, did the four brothers then go down soon after that and explore more of the area?
GS:
Yes, they staked extensively on the rim of Deer Flat. As a matter of fact I think fairly shortly after Wiley and Uncle Seth found the Hideout, I think some of the other brothers went down and staked. I think they even called them Hideout Number Two or Three something, just appendages right next to it t hat al l had deposits on. I may be wrong as to the proximity
43

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
or the sequence, and also even perhaps Wiley was in on these also. I'm not sure, but they did then after this go to Deer Flat which is the plateau on the side of White Canyon.
ss: Uh huh. on the north side.
GS: And staked extensively there. I remember being there
as a matter of fact with Dad and Uncle Seth when they staked the Dead Buck claim there. We were going along there and we found--I can't remember what we found first, the outcrop or the dead buck, but anyway we decided the claim should be named the Dead Buck because there was a huge buck that had been shot probably during the last deer season and had laid there all winter long. Someone had shot him and never found him, I guess, because they would have surely taken him in because he was a huge buck, a big, big buck, I think nine horns, nine antlers on one side as I recall. Then we named this the Dead Buck and it was a pretty good claim. That was on Deer Flat. They did stake extensively there, although they could have staked much more extensively. They could have staked the whole Deer Flat, up on top and across instead of just the rim, and been very successful in doing so. But from there they then went up on to Elk Mountain which was just a natural sequence away. You go to Red
44

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
Canyon, White Canyon, Deer Flat and then up on to Elk Mountain--and staked rather extensively on a number of outcrops in the North Elk area.
SS: Did you go with them on those prospecting trips?
GS: I was there; I wasn't there when they staked the Knotch claims, but I was there when they went back to do the assessment work the next year and that was the second time I got lost. I didn't get lost again. What had happened, we were going back and there was thick brush as I recall. There was very thick brush on top of the mountain and we were going back fighting our way through. Dad and Uncle Seth, Dad could outwalk any 15 men, normal men, even though he was then 65 years old. We were going along and I was just having a terrible time keeping up with them and I remember Dad and Uncle Seth slipped down this big bank of Chinle, and as I started down, Dad said, "Gary, don't
come down here." And he mumbled something else and I thought he said, "Just wait there for me! We'11 be right back, you know." He meant, "Don't come down there. Follow along and find a better place to come down instead of [here]," because there was a rim off. If I didn't stop sliding at just the right place I'd just slide clear off into Hammond Canyon. So I stayed right there and I sat there and I remember I was
45

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
sitting there holding onto this root. I'd started sliding down when they told me not to, and I was there holding onto the root and I looked up and here was a big old centipede crawling along the root. So I had to let go of that and go down a little and I was becoming increasingly disenchanted with staying there holding on there at this point because it had been oh, a half hour and I thought they should have come back for me by then and maybe a little longer than that. So I waited and waited and finally I shouted. As I shouted then I listened and I could hear way, way, way out, just barely hear it was so far off. I could hear somebody shout back and I had said, "Dad, can I come down there?" and as soon as I said that and I heard them shout. I thought, "Oh no, they thought I said"--here's a big break, you know, and I heard them shout and then I felt real silly you know. But it was so far off and I just sat there and I heard these shouts going and going and actually getting closer each time. Finally someone shouted and there was a pause for quite a while, and then someone shouted up on the rim above and I shouted back. Then Dad said, "Gary?" I said, "Yeah." He said, "Where in the world have you been? We've been just frantic."
You know, when they got down and went down a ways Dad
46

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
called up apparently and said, "Gary, you can come down now." There was no answer and they thought I had got ahead of them and gone on down. So they went down and got clear down to the end to where they had some
claims and I didn't show up and didn't show up and they started getting worried. They thought I had just wandered out somewhere in that whole area there, so to try and find me they started shouting and they didn't hear me and they got very concerned. But all of this time I had been there clinging to the same root you know, and so when Dad learned that I had just stayed right there, he was really very relived and very happy that I had not wondered off, because if I would have started wandering at all I'm sure I would have got hopelessly lost there. It was very late in the afternoon. But this--I hadn't been there when they staked the claims, but I was there when they went back to do the assessment work.
SS: Now, that area is quite rugged. Did you have to follow the trail up from Blanding up over ---?--- over to North Elk?
GS: There was a road by the time we got there. A road, it wasn't a good road at all. As a matter of fact, I remember we got stuck in the pickup just trying to get over. It wasn't mud, it was just plain old sand
47

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
you know. We did get stuck on that trip going out there and we had to get out and pile a whole load of rocks into the back of the pickup in order to get over it. I remember I had to ride in the back then. I don't remember why now. Well, I guess maybe I just enjoyed it. I guess I got carsick wherever I rode, and so I enjoyed, I guess little kids like to ride in backs of pickups, but I remember on that trip as had
always been the case, I knew this was the penalty for going with Dad out to the mines, and yet I loved it enough that I was willing to do this. I would always get carsick. If I was going to Cottonwood I would get carsick once going out and once coming back, and if I was going to White Canyon I'd get carsick at the same spot as I would going to Cottonwood. There was a rock there that I could almost splatter every time. You know, riding in the back of the pickup I wouldn't even bother telling Dad and Uncle Seth that I was carsick. I would just wait until the time came and heave. I would get carsick once there if I was going to White Canyon and then again out about the time we were coming down off Maverick Point on the other side of the mountain I'd get carsick the second time, but it was--going to White Canyon it was a two-time ordeal. It was never very comfortable. What we call
48

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
carsickness was terribly uncomfortable. I remember very definitely as we were very young, going out to Cottonwood. My one cousin Rex also got carsick, and
it was kind of a contest as to who would make it
first.
SS: Well, what year would this have been approximately
that you were doing the assessment work at that
particular time on North Elk?
GS: It would have been I believe 1949, because I spent
the summer of 1949 with Dad and Uncle Seth down in White Canyon, a good part of the summer down there. It was on the way back from down there that we had driven up across North Elk to do the assessment work. When I say assessment work I should say "assessment work," because we got there late in the afternoon and
I think the assessment work probably consisted of them going down and rolling a few rocks off the cliff there at these [claims] and maybe throwing a few branches and a few roots and a few rocks out of the road, road building or something like this for the assessment now. But it was the summer of 1949.
ss: And then what mining activity were you involved with in White Canyon that you were returning from?
GS: Dad and Uncle Seth had been mining the Gone Away claim I believe. I was just east of the Happy Jack.
49

They had a little camp set up there just down in the rocks. Every morning we'd walk out to the mines. As we started we'd have to walk up there and do a little shooting without a compressor, just single jacking, drilling, actually, just mainly putting some dynamite under some big rocks and blowing them off and there was high grade right on the surface there. We got a
little stockpile of ore there that looked quite good and then we had Oz Hunt come and built a road up there. That's rather an expensive road building up over the cliff and up over the talus slope. He came and brought his cat, his caterpillar and bulldozed a road up to the claim there so we could get a truck up to get the ore down, but it wasn't underground. As a matter of fact, when I left at the end of the summer there was a tunnel you still--it wasn't back into where you'd need a miner's light or anything. Much of it was right on the surface right there. When Oz got there he stripped off some more of the surface and you could just shoot up the rock right there and load it in. As a matter of fact there was even a hazard I recall. We had quite a hard time finding any place to get that you could get--you had to make the fuses very long and then just run like mad and go. Even then you had to dodge rocks. I remember because when
50

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
you're shooting just in the open there; when these blasts went off it just threw rocks up three or four hundred feet in the air and across like this. You'd look and you'd see this big rock coming hurtling down at you and you were just--you'd have to look to see where they were coming and step out of their way one way or another. It was not an overly safe kind of mining venture for this reason. It was hard to get
far enough away given the ruggedness of the terrain, to keep out of the way of the rocks when they'd blast. It wasn't much of a mining operation, but it was a great summer. It was a great experience to be there in that country when it was just primeval country. Dad and them were even naming the land, Dad and anybody else who went there when they named something, it was the name it ended up getting I guess. Hidden Valley, they had some claims there and they named it Hidden Valley and it's Hidden Valley on the maps now and a few other places that they named in that area, those are the names that appear on the
maps.
SS: Fry Canyon for instance.
GS: Yeah, yeah. I'm not sure. Did they?
ss: I was under that impression. I think--what did your
uncle tell me, that they named Fry Canyon? 51

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
GS: Oh, I hadn't known this but it probably is true. But
it was a great experience to be there when this was just a Shangri-La really. It was so primeval, so untouched, that the rabbits didn't even have enough sense to run away from you. I remember I had been going to take the .22 down but at the last minute for some reason I didn't. I had a carton of bullets packed away and when we got down there, oh I believe Bud Nielson and Keith Jones as I recall were working at the Happy Jack and they had a .22 but they didn't have any bullets and furthermore the rear side had
been knocked bringing it down there over the rough roads, the rear side had been knocked off, and so all you had was the head on the front of the gun to sight. But we combined in the evenings, we'd combine my bullets with their .22 and go out hunting rabbits and it was fairly fortunate that the rabbits were so stupid that they didn't know enough to get out of the way, because it sometimes would take several shots to get enough to have cottontails for supper that evening. I remember there was a big old lizard, big green and yellow long tailed lizard that just became kind of a part of our camp there and it--there was water dripping from the water bag, you know, and there this was all the water that was in the whole
52

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
country; we brought it down in these metal containers and then we put it in one of these water bags to keep it cold enough to drink. It was blazing hot and this old lizard several times a day would come up and just open its mouth up and wait for one of those drops to come from the water bag and maybe wait for four or
five of them and then it would take off again and then come back again. It may not even had been the same lizard, although I think it was actually. It just became kind of a pet around here. The rattlesnakes were tame enough that you could hit them over the head with a rock. It just wasn't anything in that country that was disturbed at all, hardly.
SS: Well, in the Summer of '49 had work begun on the VCA mill that was being built?
GS: Yes, it had. As a matter off fact, there was a buying station there. I spent quite a bit of my time riding with the ore truck. Teke Lyman was hauling ore and I would ride with him down to the mill. Actually it even seems like there was some kind of a mill there although I may have just assumed that it was a mill
when in fact all it was was just a buying station. But there was some kind of an operation going on there and I recall going in and being weighed and checking in the truck and being weighted and checked
53

 DR . GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
and dumped the sample taken.
SS: Was this ore from the Gone Away?
GS:
He hauled any ore that Dad and them had, but I think this consisted of only at the most one truckload a day and maybe not even that. Most of it he was hauling I think from the Happy Jack, but anytime Dad and them had a load he'd come and get that.
Was this one of those small seven ton trucks?
Yeah, it may have been eight tons or nine tons, but it probably would have been an F-6 Ford as I recall. What was your impression of the White Canyon community when you first saw it?
Boy, I don't recall that there was anything there. I really don't recall that there was any town there
when I--there may have been that there was and we never saw it, but I recall going over to the ferry and going across on the ferry. Chaplin had a ferry there and I recall that, and I don't recall any kind of a town there in 1949. It seems like I would have remembered something about it if there would have
ss: GS:
SS:
GS:
been anything there.
SS: I believe that at one time in a period of inactivity,
I don't know if it was--I believe that the mill was probably under construction if not completed in the fall of '49 and it didn't open for operation until
54

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
the spring of 150. I believe that at one period of inactivity either then or later when the mill had been discontinued or there was another period that it was just shut down for awhile that your father worked out there as a watchman.
GS: Yes, I believe it must have been that winter. I was, I would say in the fourth grade that winter. I'm not entirely sure, but it seems like I was in the fourth grade that winter. I remember the feeling I had when Dad left. I probably didn't realize everything that I know [now]. There was a little tension and a little something that made me terribly insecure. Anyway Dad had several loads of wood brought in. We used wood in stoves, wood and coal in stoves, and he had a supply of coal and several loads of slab lumber that we used for wood in the stoves brought in and made sure that the family was all taken care of as far as these kinds of things. He left and I rarely remember feeling really sincerely as lonesome as I felt when Dad left at that time. It was a terribly lonesome
time for me and for Mom and my brothers and sisters, I know, but I remember Dad leaving and taking off and he spent the winter down there. He'd write us letters very often and always included dollar bills for each
one of us to spend, you know, for different things, 55

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
but he did spend a good part of the winter--! think he came back one time in the winter as I recall. It was a very bad winter I remember. A very bad one. The
snow was very deep. He probably came back more than once actually, but I remember one time only when he did come he apparently had a great experience down there. I mean it was an interesting kind of experience, and I never talked to him too much about it. I wished I would have now, it was one of those things that never occurred to me to talk to him [about] too much. He did tell me about a man being drowned there one day. A man who had swam the river. An excellent swimmer and a young man apparently he thought very highly of, they were close friends. Apparently the community at that time was very, very close-knit, the people that were there. He had felt very highly of this young man. It seems like he was someone from back East who had come out there. I'm not even sure of that, but he was a very superb swimmer. Yet one day he was swimming and it almost seemed like maybe he was knocked out of a boat or something. Anyway he just disappeared and they found his body, I think they found his body several miles downstream. He told me about a huge catfish that he caught and told me a little about some of the people
56

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
that were there, how kind they were and what interesting discussions that they had and how everybody treated him very, very nice.
SS: Do you recall that these people were people that were connected with the mill or were they what you might call the local residents of Hite?
GS: No, he did go over to Hite a few times, and I don't even know how much there was at Hite. I don't think there was much more there, but there wasn't much more, my impression was, on this side of the river either. There were only a very few people there. My impression then as a matter of fact was that there must not have been over ten people there at the time. Since then a number of people have told me they knew Dad down there that winter and made me wonder if maybe there weren't more, but my impression was at that time that there was a very, very small number.
ss: Well, then you returned the next summer to that country, didn't you?
GS: I think I probably went down the next summer once or twice. I didn't stay there. The next time that I really was down there to stay was the summer of 1954.
ss: What sort of impressions of change did you get between that trip in '49 and the one in '54?
GS: There was--it was a whole different area. The 57

 DR .
GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
cottontails were gone. I remember I looked forward to them being there and they were gone. There weren't any around. I suspect even the rattlesnakes were so wild or--I didn't even see one again anyway. There was a real thriving town. It was a boom town---?--- in 1954. I had been working for Hubby, Glen, Alden Shumway and Burdette Shumway out at the Rock Claim, out in Montezuma. I had been out there a few days and had not enjoyed the experience very much. They were kind of--they liked to give people working for them a bad time and make sure they worked their tails off at all times. I was very young and just starting out as far as just mucking all day long in a mine, and I remember that the back was low, you couldn't straighten up. You had to keep bent over all day long shovelling into a shuttle buggy and I was kept right at it and we had some good ore. They'd just drilled into a good deposit of ore and there was a lot to muck out and we were working like mad. I came in one night and there was a man there who was looking for a driller's helper. I'd been making a dollar a day out working for Hubby out there at the rock claim, and this guy said he was looking for driller's helper
down in White Canyon and he would offer a dollar and a half a day plus a few other fringe benefits that
58

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
seemed like a really pie in the sky kind of thing as far as financing for a young fellow like me, and I was, I think 16 that summer. 15 or 16. It just really seemed like the thing to do, so I took off and Dad kind of wanted me to go anyway. He had a few claims that were being drilled, you know, down there. I
jumped at the chance to quit my Rock claims job and go down there. So I got my bedroll and everything together and went down to White Canyon. When I got there, we got there late at night and they showed me, I went and I had to locate a place to stay and place to eat and all. I went to the little bunkhouse--well, boarding house that was there.
SS: Let's hold if for a second.
GS: Okay. (Break in Tape)
ss: You got located in the bunkhouse.
GS: No, I didn't. I went over to the boarding house
there. I didn't know anything and the guy just kind of dropped me off. He was a rough, tough kind of guy. A real tough guy. He had--! don't think he ever paid a bill in his life and he managed to leave just when his bills got mounted up pretty high; he'd go from one place to another. He had a little tiny wife, a young wife, she was younger than I was and already had four children. I think I was 16 and she must have
59

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
been 15 and beautiful, just the most--oh, she was a beautiful girl, beautiful blonde girl and just a lovely girl and already a whole houseful of little kids and her husband. I don't know, she had a big black eye. Her husband had beat the scrud out of her
for something or another. He would get on real good and drunk quite often and was quite abusive apparently while he was drunk. He had pretty well beat her up that day we went down there. She had been beat up just before that, and she was quite submissive at this point as I recall. But we got down and they just dumped me off and said, "Well, here you are, find a place to stay and be ready to go to work in the morning." I went running around there. I was just a young kid and didn't know anything to do, but I went to this boarding house, and actually it wasn't a boarding house. You didn't live in there, you just
ate there.
SS: In White Canyon itself?
GS: Yeah, uh huh. I went to these people and they were
very kind people. They were a very fine young couple. Quite young. I don't even know their names, but I knew it at the time and appreciated very much both
[of them and] the woman's cooking. It was good and was wholesome and she was very considerate of me. She
60

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
put extra little things in my lunch everyday and things like this, but I went there and told them what
I needed and they helped me. They said it will cost you three dollars a day to eat here, and they found me a place, a little tarpaper shack. All it was was just boards up. Very primitive little place. It did have, I believe had a floor on it. No, I remember now. The fellow that was my roommate had just taken some boards and laid them on the floor, I believe, so that--and he said that was very fortunate because I had a floor in my place. They got me with another young fellow from Salt Lake who was working for the same company that I was. He was, as it worked out, he worked the day shift and I worked the night shift so we never had much chance to do anything together, but we did have some chance to compare the experiences now. So I got in there and it cost me almost nothing or almost nothing for then. I think it may have cost me five dollars a month for this place to stay. The food became--it ended up so that it seemed like most of my check went for food as I recall.
SS: I was going to ask you if you were making a dollar and a half a day, how could you--?
GS: I wasn't making a dollar and a half a day, I was making a dollar and a half an hour.
61

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
SS: Okay.
GS: Yeah. I was making a dollar and a half an hour. Of
course by the time they took the income tax out of a young unmarried, unattached fellow, wages and the expenses, different kinds of expenses, I ended up having there--! think the only place that was air conditioned in the town, it was blazing hot and I worked at night, and so in the daytime I had to try and sleep, but I also had to try and find someplace that was cool you know. The only place that was air
conditioned was a store there that doubled as kind of a beer parlor and store and post office and I think a few other things as a matter of fact, and it was air conditioned there in the front. I think I drank up all my profits in soda pop that summer there. It was a great place. It was a great experience being there with all the old drunks. Every once in awhile one of them would rouse themselves off the counter just enough to say, "I'll spring for everybody here." So there were beers lined up and one soda pop, you know. I guess I left just about time--it was time for me to spring or something and I probably would have used up the rest of the money I earned that summer to spring. But I got situated in this tarpaper shack and spend the next day just resting up and recuperating
62

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
and then that night went to work in the evening.
SS: What was the name of the company you worked for?
GS: Boyles Brothers Drilling Company. The claims that we were drilling you went up past the mill, right past the mill on the road and around to the road that Dad had built up there, some of his claims and around and around and way to the other side of the cliff and
then beyond, down in a valley. It was about 13 miles over. You had to have a power wagon to get up there, and way over there we were drilling claims. It was a rugged country back in there and there were mountain sheep, bighorn sheep around and we'd see them occasionally as we were coming to and from. I remember being up in the top of the drilling rig and we'd shut down to do something, make some minor repair, and sitting up there--I was just a young boy and it was maybe three o'clock in the morning and there would be a big old moon. I remember one night a big moon coming up over the rimrocks there, over the
Wingate cliffs and there was a coyote sitting up on the Wingates just howling away. I was young and I was homesick and I was lonesome and it was such a different life. It was so different to me that I could hardly adjust to having coming from a very staid, very close Mormon home to a boom mining camp
63

 DR .
GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
with all the vices and enticements of a boom mining camp. That night was so lonesome. I remember that one especially there with that coyote howling there and all alone, really virtually in the top of this drill rig. But it was interesting work. The fellow that I worked with was not much of a--was a real rugged tough guy in most ways and was always very considerate to me. The whole group of them, I know it was because of my family and their importance in the area and all, but everybody there treated me with a great deal of respect. People who had known my father
I think went out of their way in any number of ways that I wasn't even aware of to make sure that my stay there was as enjoyable as it could possibly be.
SS: Would you describe to me just what kind of equipment [you had] and what you did on this drilling rig? How
large was the crew that worked on it?
GS: There was just me and the driller, the driller's
helper (which was me) and the driller, and there was the daytime crew. A man by the name of Johnnie, I can't remember his last name, but there was a little very short Italian and he and Dave Baker, this guy that I was working for, were the day and night drillers. But they had been together. They had been down in Ambrosia Lake drilling. This is where I heard
64

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
of Ambrosia Lake because when we were here drilling down and maybe finding a few inches of mineralization ore even a little ore. They had been drilling in 70 feet of ore down there and he told me about this. This is the first that I heard and didn't hear about it for years after that as a matter of fact. For some reason the gap between the initial discoveries and production was somewhat late--it seemed like at least from my hearing about it it was. But they'd been down there drilling together. I can't remember this little Italian's name but he was a terrific driller. He was a great driller and had developed quite a bit of prestige in the drilling business. He knew how to drill and knew exactly what was happening and Babe, the guy I was working with, wasn't nearly the driller. He would have been a little more capable if his mind would have been a little clearer, but he was almost always drunk when we went and drunk enough so that I would have to drive just by the fact that I just about scared the pants off of him driving over those roads with just barely learning how to drive you know, but the alternative was so grim that we
both agreed I would do the driving and they were--it was just a little trail up with nothing but a cliff way down off the side and it was pretty frightening
65

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
for me because it was a high old power wagon with a water tank on the back of it and the water would slosh back and forth and sideways, back and forth, and you could feel this jerking and pulling you. Then we'd take this load of water up there and use the load of water in drilling. Sometimes I'd have to come down and get another load during the night sometimes. It was just a bigger drill rig than I had ever seen since then. It was a big enough so that in the regular wagon drills or other drills that I worked on after this time, you would both stand on a little platform or just in the dirt, you know at the base, but in this one I would work in the derrick. He'd work down below and we would have a taller standing pipe and I would do the changing up at the top. No, we'd we would put the additional joint of pipe on down at the bottom, but I would have to beat at the top to lift it over rather than having the cable that would lift it up as you usually did on a drill rig. But it--I don't know what kind of a drill it was, but it was larger than usual and you could
drill deeper.
SS: And you were doing exploratory work?
GS: Yes.
SS: At approximately what depths, were you up on the
66

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1 W ingate?
GS: No, we weren't. We were below the Wingate. As a matter of fact we were right on top of the Shinarump. [Ed: In the Chinle Formation] It wasn't deep drilling
there and we were core drilling, which would have been absolutely unnecessary. As a matter of fact we may have even found some ore there in a place or two, but we never were sure because every time it got to the point where there was the possibility that there would be some ore, we would lose the core. You'd come back with your ore barrel only half full and you'd see where it started here and there was nothing. You could see a different kind of rock next to it and only in 12 foot core barrel. They have maybe six feet of rock or something and we never were sure. We didn't have a probe to probe the holes with. I'm not sure there was, I guess there must have been some in existence then, but we didn't have--and I really think it would have been much, much more economical to have used a wagon drill, drilling with air for example, and not coring. Just using a regular knuckle bit instead of a diamond bit on it that you cut cores with. But we did core, and even though it was only I think 10 feet down to the Moenkopi, we cored all
the way.
67

 DR. SS:
GS:
GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
Do you recall how the person for whom you were doing this drilling was charged, how much and by the foot? No, it was by the foot. We kept this as the last thing we did before we came home. Meanwhile I was cleaning up the stilts and wrenches and other things. Washing them off and all, and we would sit down and write down in the book just how much footage we'd made that night, and it was by the foot that we were paid. These were claims that had been staked as speculative claims for one of the companies, one of the boom companies, and this was just as the boom was getting pretty well started, the speculative boom, the stock market boom. This had been staked for this
purpose.
Do you recall what the name of the stock company was?
SS:
GS: No, I don't. I never did know and I think there were
precautions taken for no one to know in the area just so that people couldn't either boom or probably not worrying about booming, but cutting down the price. In other words people went back and said we drilled that whole set of claims and there wasn't a bit of ore on the claims or something like this. The people wouldn't have appreciated their stockholders knowing things like this. So there was, I believe, some
precaution taken so that they didn't know any of us. 68

 DR.
GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
The town was full of--there were a number of people my age who were working on drilling rigs for different people and none of us knew whose claims we were working on that I can recall.
Now one thing that I would like you to do by way of comparison, is in 1949 when you where in White Canyon the Happy Jack was in operation and you were working at the Gone Away. Were there any other mines in operation at that time?
There were. Uncle Lee and Uncle Harris were working I believe White Canyon Number One or one of them along there. They were there doing that. I wasn't aware of any other mining operations at all going on at that time.
And it had--did that picture compare with what was going on in the way of actual ore production in 1964? The Hideout of course was then going very strong and I believe the Sandy mine. I imagine the Blue Lizard down in Red Canyon, the Happy Jack, of course, and White Canyon Number One and the Gone Away and several other of the White Canyon claims were producing quite strongly then, but even at that time my impression is that the production wasn't anywhere near what it was a couple of years later. It was still largely, at least my impression of it was that it was still
SS:
GS:
ss:
GS:
69

 DR . GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
largely a great deal of drilling activity going on and blocking out ore reserves of different kinds, but mining ope~ations just beginning on a number of the-- you know the Gizmo and the old Radium King and the--
SS: How about the Spook and the--?
GS: Yeah the Spook, uh huh. My impression was that they
were just then beginning into operation. As a matter of fact, these may well have been some of the claims that others were drilling while we were there. The whole town was largely at this time--he VCA mill had closed down. It was inoperbable and most of the activity was exploration work, was my impression.
ss: Were there still people of the mill era living in White Canyon when you were there?
GS: Yes, I think there were a few, although I couldn't tell you their names. These people that ran the boarding house I'm quite sure were of the mill era and also the people who had the trading post were, and some of the old, some of the people that were there, I had the impression that had been there for two or three years at least and just kind of liked it, but largely and by far it was a real booming situation then. I mean there were cabins all over the
place and all throughout the tamaracks there. There were a great number of people living right there and
70

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
also a lot more who were out in mining camps around just in drilling and things that came in on weekends to the town there. I remember some parties that we had on weekends there that were really great.
SS: Why don't you tell me about some of your experiences. GS: Well, I was working at night you know, so I had to find largely my own entertainment, and I remember
some things about it that were almost winsome. There was the girl who was married and had four children you know who was about my age and she was beautiful, a really truly beautiful girl and I think she was also not overly happy with her marriage and her situation of being drug from one place to another and her husband never paying his bills and beating up on her and being drunk most of the time and never having any money. It was just kind of a rugged, rigorous area when you live where you have to haul your water in and outside plumbing and all these things. I am quite sure she wasn't overly happy about this. I
would go swimming every day in the afternoon after I woke up. I would go over and go swimming and take my bar of soap along and take a bath in the Colorado River and I would swim in there, swim in this little eddy that was there. There was a big cottonwood tree hanging out over the river and a little bank down and
71

 DR .
GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
the swimming pool there, a deep hole in there was all it was in the edge of the river, but this wasn't too desirable for several reasons. The main drawback to the swimming hole was that the sewer from this boarding house and all came in just about this a little ways, and most of the sewer was dumped in the
river upstream shortly above this and it hadn't had time to be processed by the river as well as it might. There were all kinds of drawbacks and hazards to swimming in this little pool, one of which was just the stench that I'm sure now knowing what we do about things would have kept anybody from even coming close to it. It wasn't, I guess the stench wasn't that much, but it was noticeable at least. So I would spend a good part of my time out swimming in the main channel of the river. It was terr1bly invigorating, terribly exciting at the least to swim in the channel of that river. You'd get out there and be swimming along and it would just pull you at a--it just seemed like a tremendous rate downstream so that to swim across the river would take you maybe oh, two and a half or three miles just to swim across, swimming with all the vigor that you had, to swim across you'd be swept downstream that much before you got to the other side. As you got into the channel, you got in
72

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
very easily. There was something that would just suck you into the middle, but trying to get out of the channel over to the other side, or to get back again, was very, very hard. It would just keep pushing you back into the channel and to try to swim back into
the channel it required all the energy that you had. It was very exciting and almost too thrilling at times. It was frightening almost but there was something about it that would keep you going back day after day. I remember I used to swim across, and then there was a big long sandbar with most of the channel on the left side of it, on the east bank, east part of the river. You know this was far towards the west, but there was a little water going on the other side of it too. That's where I'd mount that sand bank and run up and down it there. I remember it was so hot that if you wanted to cross it and get in and swim across the river to the other side, it was--oh, it was a couple of blocks across this big sandbar and you had to take off running just as fast as you could and run as far as you could with the blazing hot sun and then hurry and stop and dig a hole real fast and get your feet into áit down because it was so hot that it would just bake your feet and you couldn't have done it. You couldn't have gone all the way across
73

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
it. It would have been so painful. You would have laid down and sizzled the rest of your body I think. But I learned very quickly there was very cool sand down beneath and you could just furiously dig a hole and get down to it and get your feet cooled off and then run again fast as you could across. But I remember after I'd been there a few days, this girl started coming. I would go swimming and the girl would come over too and swim and we never did really ever--there was no hanky panky of any kind and we didn't even really communicate except that I remember how very beautiful she was, and how, you know there was an attraction that you could feel there between two people of the same age. Yet I went my way back home and have never seen her ever again in life. I've never seen either of them and never heard what did ever happen to them as a matter of fact.
SS: What was her first name?
GS: I don't remember.
SS: Ah.
GS: And so far as entertainment, other things, I remember
we had a party one weekend. A couple of my cousins were working, they were up in the Jacob's Chair area. What they were doing, they would come into the area, be driven in as close as they could get in a jeep, go
74

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
up and stake a whole batch of claims up in that area and then find some mesa with a big enough area on top that a plane could land on it and they would clear a landing strip there, just grub the sagebrush off or pull up whatever was needed and fill in spots so the plane could land. At some of the places that these planes lit at that time were just unbelievable. You'd have a little Cessna or a little Piper Cub that could
land in almost anything and they would. They would make a runway big enough for the plane to land and pick them up then and then they would go somewhere else and stake more claims. I remember that Duane Shumway and LeMarr Heckless were down there staking claims for a company, doing this. One weekend they came down to White Canyon and there was a dance being held that evening and the three of us as young vigorous enthusiastic young bucks went to the dance and there were a lot of good looking girls there, fine looking girls and we had a lovely evening there. There were whole huge loads of beer, case upon case you can stack up there, and everyone just--I can¥t even remember who it was who furnished it now. Some of the people there though had bought all of the beer and then they bought several cases of soda pop for those of us who didn't drink beer. It was a lovely
75

 DR.
GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
evening just drinking soda pop that didn't quit. We had an old record player there and had some pretty good records there and we just had a great time. We had old work clothes on. I remember I was dancing out there with big old boots on and clothes that probably didn't even smell too good, but everybody treated us very nice and it was a great dance. It was a real good dance.
Out in the open?
No, it was inside a big old building. Although there were a lot of people outside too. There was kind of a hall there that I think the people had thrown together or that was at least there, I had the
impression at the time that the people had built it as kind of a community project.
Is that where the school was held?
Well, this was in the summer and, yes, I believe it was or as I recall now I think there may have been a smaller building right next to this that school was held in, although I may be wrong. This was just one big long hall, and I believe there may have been a
building next to it. I'm not entirely sure. It was in the summer and there wasn't any school being held. But it was a good, good party, really with everyone-- there were a few fights I remember and a few people

that were way too drunk to operate properly, but generally there was a good feeling there and an enjoyable time. Most of my recreation was swimming though as I recall, and sitting around listening to people in this trading post there. This is where I
spent most of my spare time. But I remember two or three nights a group of the young people there, a young Black boy and Terry O'Brien I believe his name was, it was some Irish name--this fellow that I was living with who was from Salt Lake who was working for Boyles Brothers also, and a couple of the Whitlock brothers from Provo who had the, I believe Whitlock-White something Uranium Company, were down there drilling some of their claims. A few others would get together in the evenings--we did two or three evenings and went out hunting foxes after dark. We'd take a spotlight out and they were actually swift--they were smaller than foxes but were a fox variety. We'd shine the spotlight up and they'd just be tearing off across the rocks in the dark, or they'd stop and you could see their eyes shining with the spotlight and we'd shoot at them. We never did get one of them I don't think ever, but we had a good time shooting them running over the cliffs at night. But as far as recreation, half of--lots of visiting
77

 DR . GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
was about what we did.
SS: You said there were a lot of good looking girls. How in the world did good looking girls materialize?
GS: They may have not been so good looking. It may have
been that after a few weeks they looked like they were good looking, but I was just at that age where I was quite interested in girls and I really think there were some. My impression was that they--I know this one girl was very, very good looking--the married girl, and there was another girl who the last two or three days I was there I got to know quite well. I can't even remotely remember her name. The only thing that I can remember about her was that she had been over in Wayne County; they had come from out
in the country somewhere and she and her father and mother and younger brothers and sisters had been over there and had joined the Mormon Church over in Wayne County. Then they had moved over there and had a fairly respectable home on the north side of town there that was much nicer than most of the homes in the area. Just the last two or three days we found each other and we spent an awful lot of time there. We even had a really good romance going and there was some feeling. I remember she told me when I got ready to leave that she regretted that we hadn't got to
78

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
know each other much sooner that summer instead of just waiting for the last little part, but as I recall we made up for some of it in the last two or three days and she was pretty. She was young. I mean she wasn't full blown, full grown or anything really, but she was pretty and very sweet and very
interesting to be around. I think if I were to have seen her a few years later, even in more civilized state that I would have agreed that she was still pretty. There were some of the other girls. There were a couple of girls there who I think were there for an economic venture you know, that were quite pretty as I recall too, although I never did--I wasn't very fascinated by them at the time. They weren't overly pretty but they were apparently pretty enough so that--I guess you don't have to be too pretty to at least make it fairly lucrative for them.
SS: There were quite a few people there, I mean the wages were quite good there?
GS: Uh huh, and expenses weren't too high. The food [prices] in the store were very high but most people I think would do their shopping out and bring it in and just get those things that you had to have like beer and soda pop you know. They did have a stock of food there, but I'm sure it was much higher there
79

 DR .
GARY L. SHUMWAY #1
than it would have been in Blanding or Hanksville or Green River or somewhere. I think people that were living there probably got most of their supplies out and only bought most of those things they had to have in there. There wasn't much to spend your money on. Certainly housing was very inexpensive and very substandard also.
SS: How about gambling? Did you witness much gambling while you were there?
GS: Boy, I didn't witness any gambling. I really didn't. I suspect part of this would reflect the fact that I worked at night and we worked every night, not--the only times we had to do other things was when we were shut down for two or three days at a time. But I'm sure there was some of that that went on, but I don't think it would have been as great of stakes or as predominant a thing as you may have found in some mining camps. There wasn't a saloon that everyone just sat around and gambled in at least. The one place you would have suspected to find this I don't remember seeing any of it at all in that.
ss: Not over in the pool game in the store?
GS: I don't even remember there being a pool table there,
although there may have been and I may just not have been fascinated with those kinds of things. All I
80

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
remember there being is just a bar along there and people sitting there and talking, talking at length and telling all kinds of exciting stories of their mining operations as well as other kinds of stories. I don't believe there was a pool table there. I'm sure there was some gambling going on that I wasn't involved in.
SS: Well, once you went in were you in for the duration more or less for the summer? Did you get out?
GS: I came back twice during the summer, but it was an ordeal. It was a terrible ordeal. One time, for example, Terry, this fellow I was living with and I went into Blanding over a weekend. On the way back we were in his little car and we blew out three tires going in. We had--they were old tires. At least the spares were old that we had and they blew out so that I can't remember what happened. It seems like we had- -the last little ways we had to get a ride in with somebody else, and then somebody gave us a tire to take back out and put on the car, but it was just a rough enough road and it was a terrible road. It really was. You could pay five dollars and get across the ferry and go out to Green River that way, but that 100 miles there was as bad, almost as bad as
going to Blanding 100 miles that way, and so it was 81

 DR . GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
not a very rational thing to do very often, to leave there.
SS: Was there a lot of flying in and out going on?
GS: Uh huh. A good deal of flying. People who really had to get somewhere or get around, it made a good deal of sense at that time. When you could fly to Blanding
in little over 20 minutes and it would take you all day--and it would. It would take you almost a solid day of just bone-jarring driving to get to Blanding in a car, and a car wasn't good for very many trips. Even a new car wouldn't least very many trips. You've had some experience with roads that are so much better than I thought it was a super highway as I went over it this summer. But you know what effect this does have on cars, so flying was a good way to get around, and if there was any emergency, of course, flying was the way.
SS: And were there pilots that had planes in White Canyon that would be available if you had to get out?
GS: There was one plane there that was there all the time and then there were planes that flew in and out quite often, but, as I thought, it was the man who owned the trading post, I have thought all of these years that the man who owned the trading post, the only thing I can remember about him is that he was quite a
82

 DR.
GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
good looking man as I recall, kind of of square-jawed that I can recall and quite a capable man, quite an
impressive kind of person. His wife had tinted red hair, that always my whole background had led me (to believe] that women who had painted hair you know were painted kind of women. I guess she was just as sweet and pure as the driven snow, but I remember, that's what I remember about them was that she had tinted red hair and that he seemed to be quite capable and I was sure, I was sure that it was he who had the plane and did fly people in and out of emergencies and flew out quite often for different
reasons I remember--
You say that something had come up to change your opinion?
ss:
GS: Well, someone I was talking to this summer who said that Myron Foree, I believe, who apparently owned the trading post this time, didn't fly.
SS: He did, he did.
GS: Oh, is that right?
SS: Y es.
GS: Oh, okay.
ss: That's the report he gave me.
GS: Okay, fine. Well, this solves it. Does his wife, does his wife have tinted hair or--?
83

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
ss: It was blond when I first met her.
GS: Yeah, I'm sure times have changed you know. Chemicals
have come and different things that make blonds possible whatever you started. But this must have-- this was my impression at the time, as I recollect. I remember one time something quite sad. The man that lived next to us--and it shows how impersonal even in this kind of a situation I guess you can be, when you're new there and you're involved in this and all, involved in working every day and other people are new and you don't know them. I felt quite guilty about this as a matter of fact the rest of my life. The man next to us, he must have been about 40 years of age. He got sick one day and he got sick quite often always because he drank far, far too much and he had ulcers. Every time he'd drink way too much he'd get sick. So one day he got even sicker than usual and the next day he was even sicker and the next day he was even sicker and he finally got so sick that he quit drinking just to show you how sick he was. He did, he quit drinking and he wasn't drinking anything at all. So when he didn't get better in the next two or three days some of the
people around got a little bit concerned about him. I remember one morning very, very early, I think I was
84

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
just getting home from work and he was just coming back from a little trip to the john and I said, "Well, how are you feeling?" and he said, "Oh, I'm not feeling good at all. I'm not at all." He looked like he really meant it, and I went inside and told my roommate that he wasn't feeling too good and I just climbed in bed. He came over there and he just knocked on the door and he said, "Oh, God, you've got to help me. You've got to get me out of here. You've got to get me out of there." And so we went to the door and he really was, he was just really sick. So we took him down and the man at the trading post cranked up his plane and took off just as it got light, just enough light to see, and took off with him, I think to Grand Junction, although I'm not sure. It may have been Moab or somewhere, but he died a couple of days later with a ruptured appendix. It had been ruptured before, it had apparently just ruptured when he came over and told us, but he had appendicitis for a week before, and you can imagine the kind of agony he must have been going through. I guess it had ruptured, and he came over and got us to take him up. But why we didn't show enough consideration for someone else to do this sooner I don't know. Except the fact that he had problems all
85

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
summer with overdrinking and he'd always have problems of different kinds when he did drink too much, but he did die. It was Mr. Foree I guess that flew him out that morning. But it was too late.
SS: As you were saying, the population of the town may have had a few of the old mill people still there and there were a number of speculators that came.

 [THIS IS THE CONTINUATION OF AN INTERVIEW WITH DR. GARY L. SHUMWAY BY SUZANNE SIMON ON AUGUST 3 1 , 1 9 7 0 IN ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA FOR THE UTAH URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT. TAPE #1.]
GS: SS: GS:
A number of people involved in the--
W ell, yes.
The people that were there were--actually you had to be a pretty sincere part of the industry. There weren't any of the fly-by-nighters who would--milking
the boom who were there. I mean, they were putting their money's worth into it if they were there. It wasn't promotional, although some of them were engaged in promotional activity, but a very sincere kind of promotion. I mean they were there looking for ore and they weren't just skipping off with the profits of the sell of stock.
Could you estimate how many people were there in the summer you were there?
People that actually lived there, actually were there and were working there, probably weren't over 300, but there were--it drew you know from the whole area, and in the area that there were probably five or six
hundred that were in within a 20 mile radius. Including some of the larger mining camps and this sort of thing and other exploratory drillers and so forth?
SS:
GS:
SS:
GS: Yeah, uh huh. I may be totally wrong on those figures 87

 DR.
ss:
GS:
GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
but it wasn't a large group to have. The one little trading post could handle the area and to now have any other kind of activities.
You say that even though it was summer and the school wasn't in session, you were under the impression that they still held school there?
Well, they held school after that I'm quite sure. I know they had before. There may have been a time between the closing of the VCA mill and this opening of the boom part of it that there weren't schools; that school hadn't been held, and this may have been
for a couple of years after that there wasn't. I suspect many of these people were people who would keep their families elsewhere in the wintertime rather than have them there.
Were you under the impression that most of these mines kept up an all-year operation there? I suspect that the ones on Elk Ridge and perhaps Deer Flat had closed in the winter.
I'm not sure that Deer Flat did. I suspect they probably kept open most of the time. I know they built a road up from below about this time or shortly after this time so that this would mean that they wouldn't have to cross the mountain in the wintertime. You probably couldn't plan on crossing
SS:
GS:
88

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
the mountain during much of the winter, but I think most of them in Red Canyon and White Canyon would be year-round operations. I sure remember very few of them that were actually in mining stages then. I may have just not been aware of it.
ss: According to other information I have gotten, some of the larger Red Canyon/White Canyon mines didn't get into operation until '56 and later. So that would certainly jive with what you recall. What can you tell me about your family dealing and the way in which they managed those claims that they did have in White Canyon and on Deer Flat?
GS: Well, Dad and them went down and staked these claims with almost no capital. Just almost no capital, and it was terribly expensive to build roads up to these claims. After having gone to all of these expenses of going down, finding the claims, doing the "assessment work," and going and beginning mining operations and mining some ore and building a road up so that they could get a truck up to get it down, they discovered that all of this had netted them almost nothing. They probably did make the cost because the ore was very rich, and they probably did make the coast of paying for the roads up there and all, but they were really having a struggle financially with it, primarily
89

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
because the VCA had a pretty firm contract over the area that they wouldn't ship the ore elsewhere. VCA I think probably as I look back on it now, although I don't think that I could have convinced my father of
that or that I could have been convinced of it at the time--! think they probably gave all they had to working out a process that was amenable for this ore, but either through incompetence or simple inability through there just not being a process that would work very well at that time, they couldn't find a process that would mine the highly oxidized ore that Dad and them were shipping to them even though it was very rich ore, much of it. So that samples that they had shipped that they were confident would run a couple percent in uranium would come back maybe saying it would run ten hundredths or twenty hundredths or thirty hundredths. This was very disenchanting to Dad and his brothers when they were so very short. As a matter of fact, they would even send samples out somewhere and have just the samples that they'd taken of their ore and say that it would run or 75 hundredths or so and have it come back from
the mill; much of it they just simply couldn't mill, they didn't mill. After having shipped a great deal of ore there, Denny Vowles, the VCA man simply said,
90

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
"We can't handle it so we won't mill it." So they had this contract that they were to shift their ore to the VCA mill, and yet the mill either could not handle or would not handle their ore. Probably in part because the Happy Jack could supply all the ore that the mill could handle anyway. Why try and handle these highly oxidized ores that required a much more detailed process apparently to get milled? Why mill that when you have more than you can possibly handle
from the Happy Jack itself? So Dad and them were rather disenchanted with the kind of treatment. Yet Denny Vowles had quite a stronghold over them with the contract that was set up to the point where at least he can see that he had the mines pretty well sewed up; that anyone that needed to deal with him in thinking of taking over the mines. So Dad and them having put most of their resources into developing these mines and then finding they were getting almost
nothing for it, Denny Vowles was even a little antagonistic apparently in the case of two there when Uncle Lee and Uncle Harris went to him and said, "Look, we've got to have some money. You promised us this, and we've shipped the ore in good faith and haven't got anything from it." He reportedly took out
two dollar bills and gave each one of them and said, 91

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
"Now you've been paid in full." Probably it had cost him; that's probably all the profit that he had made too, worked out possibly at least. But with this kind of discouragement, Dad and them decided that they would sell their claims. They were convinced that uranium had a great future, near future. I think there was some reluctance initially to have to do this, but they had large families who made great demands upon them. They needed and didn't have any
[cash] and after all these years there was a possibility of selling these claims. So they decided to find a buyer, and they went over and talked to Denny one more time and ---?--- both ways and told them if he couldn't guarantee them purchase of their ore at a decent price and all that they were just simply going to have to sell. I recall Dad telling me as he got back very, very discouraged, from this meeting and very disturbed, very irate. He said that Denny had looked at them and said, "I'll tell you, if you find somebody that you think will be interested in our claims, have them come around and I'll talk to them." He gave Dad and them the impression that he thought he actually controlled the claims and that they were VCA property. At least this was the impression they got, so they came back and fumed and
92

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
thought and considered it for a while. So as they got back to Blanding and talked about it and were quite agitated over it for a few days they finally wrote Denny a letter, as I recall, saying, "We've decided to sell the claims since you aren't able to take care of the ore. We're going to sell it." Denny came over to Monticello as I recall and Dad went over and talked to him and they had lunch together. The last thing Dad said was, "Now Denny, we're serious. We're going to sell those claims." He still didn't seem to
feel like they could do it without him signing the, you know, the contract or something. So they went out then and started--and there's been a number of people as I recall those days, every evening, every day as a matter of fact, every minute Dad was around there were all these terribly important people, you know, promoters with all kinds of big money taking in hundred of thousands of dollars around. I guess most of this was just shortly after this time. But there was at least enough market then so that they had two or three people quite interested in buying the claims. As I recall, I remember going out with Dad and Uncle Seth and Fennel Sitton, we went out to the claims and we went up to the Hideout claim and sat down there and went through the mine. There was just
93

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
a little short drift running back in and there was just uranium all over, showing it leached out yellow all around it. As we started back in there Uncle Seth told Fennel, he turned to him and he said, "Now, Fennel, this mine here is going to make you a million dollars," and Fennel just kind of laughed about it you know. We went back and looked it over and came
out and sat down and ate our lunch there on the edge of the cliff. As we were sitting there we looked down and there was a deer running down clear at the bottom, running down. It ran and we watched it and it ran all the way down into White Canyon below us, just slowly working its way down. As we were sitting there watching that Fennel looked at one of the bridges down there--! believe it was right at the Hideout
where we were and he could see one of the bridges, part of it spanning White Canyon. He said, "What's that down there?" Dad or Uncle Seth said, "Well, it's one of the natural bridges," and he looked at it and he said, "Well, you know, it's just a perfect road leading across there and that will be a perfect way for me to get my ore across this." Dad and Uncle Seth kind of mumbled something about, "Well, I don't think the nation's going to let you haul ore trucks across there." He said, "Oh, I think I can work it out." He
94

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
did have quite a bit of influence, but I don't think he ever had quite enough to get his ore trucks across Natural Bridges. He went back, but he told Dad and them that he was quite interested in the claims. However, in the meantime somebody else was I recall here, and the sequence isn't too good in my mind, but I remember someone else came and wanted to look at the claim. So I went out again with them and they went out to show them the claims up there and these guys were definitely interested in buying them. They told us they were interested in buying them, and on the way into town here came Fennel Sitton out. We saw his dust coming. We saw his dust coming and as we came up Fennel Sitton recognized Dad and Uncle Seth and had us stop and he jumped out and went over and said he wanted to talk to Dad and Uncle Seth in private. This other guy was there and there was a little bit of uneasiness right at this moment, but they went over and Fennel told them, he said he¥s got--let's see, what did he say? He said he had $10,000 with him there and he had another 25,000 in town and that the rest of the hundred thousand dollars was waiting in the bank in Dove Creek and that he'd have the other hundred thousand. They were
asking two hundred thousand for it, and the next few 95

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
days they asked if they would sign a paper right then, right on the stop to agree, and they said,
"Well, let's go in and talk about it." So they went in and talked about it, and since he was there with the money and these other guys simply said they were interested in it and they definitely wanted to buy them, they sat down and Fennel had the papers all drawn up and all and they signed the agreement that then gave him all of the White Canyon property.
ss: Did that include then all of the property in White Canyon that all four brothers owned?
GS: Yeah, uh huh. I don't know exactly how they worked this out, because I'm not sure it was entirely equitable you know. Some of the brothers, I know Uncle Seth's Hideout was probably worth as much as any 20, I mean as 20 of the other claims and probably more than that. Although you know 20 of some of the claims anyway, but there were a number that were very good. Apparently they all felt, the brothers felt good enough about it that they just all four threw
their claims into it. They'd been kind of partners and kind of associated in it for many years and they threw it in and $50,000 apiece seemed like an awful lot of money for them right at the moment when they'd been struggling as they had. So they all just threw
96

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
in all of their claims there. Uncle Seth apparently hadn't, as I mentioned earlier, hadn't been very enthused about including the Hideout since he owned this just alone and since he'd gone to work buying out Wiley Redd's half and all this, and it really probably shouldn't have been included, but there was enough pressure put on him that he went along with it even though he wasn't very happy.
ss: Was this the only claim over on that side of the canyon that was included?
GS: No, uh uh. No, they had claims all along the rim of Deer Flat.
ss: And those were all included?
GS: They were all included. They had claims in Deer Flat,
in White Canyon, in Red Canyon, at Fry Point and those were the ones that they included in the deal. Now after they had signed the paper and Fennel Sitton was supposed to get them the rest of the money, they went over, went in the bank and Fennel Sitton told the employees there, said, "These man have got another $25,000 apiece coming, and if they need some money in the next little while you give it to them 'cause I owe it to them," but then they were supposed to have it just anytime. It didn't come and it didn't come and it didn't come. In the meantime he had sold
97

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
them for a fabulous amount, I mean a much, much greater amount apparently than this. But he didn't fork over the money and they started getting a little concerned about it and finally started checking and he hadn't even made any preparations for paying them the money. After waiting several months for it and after him saying he wasn't going to give them any more money because he had found out they hadn't put up some corner posts or that there were disputes over some of the claims, that this is all they were worth and all. They started a lawsuit that dragged on for several years and during of which Dad and his brothers were quite deeply in debt because they had, when they were given this money they had finally
fixed up their homes and started their children in college and were a little bit less cautious with their money then they had been probably at times in the past and they were quite deeply in debt. So for several years there, until I think 1954, from about
'49 or '50 to '54, at the very time I was a teenager growing up, Dad had some debts that he worried very, very much about. ---?--- Finally, they, when Fennel Sitton saw there wasn't a chance of winning the lawsuit, not a chance, as a matter of fact they would
have been thrilled to get the claims back you know, 98

 DR.
GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
and that's what probably would have been the outcome is that they give him the hundred thousand dollars he'd given them and get all those claims back. He definitely didn't want that. So he settled out of court for most of it, although the lawyer's fees came to I think half of what Dad and them got out of it. So it was one of those cases of things being tied up and in litigation. The only people that win then are the lawyers, but they never did feel too good about Fennel Sitton and his dealings. He had not had the best reputation for some of his financial dealings, I think before this.
I believe part of the dispute over the claims centered around the difference between, instead of getting a quick claim on those claims at White Canyon and Red Canyon, well, all of them that Mr. Sitton had gotten more of these claims, more of these claims. Can you explain this?
SS:
GS: Well, I can't. I was of the impression as a matter of fact that they had simply signed the quick claims contract agreement with him. I really don't know what the actual legal problem was. Where did you--?
SS: This Art Genie Shumway was telling me all about the details on this.
GS: Oh, I see.
99

 DR . GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
ss: But I wasn't too clear as yet over just what the
legal implications of what he told me actually were. Now to go back for a little bit to the dealings that the four Shumways, senior Shumway brothers had with VCA in White Canyon, do you know if the contract that they negotiated with Denny Vowles for that ore was based on a third down payment of the value according to the assessment--?
GS: I really don't even know anything about the contract. I have never seen a copy. I'm not sure there's a copy of it. It would be interesting to see a copy. I know that was probably generally the same for all the miners who had claims there and another thing where you were under the impression at a later time that perhaps maybe some of that ore that was shipped out of the--
ss: Well, she was saying the ore that came from some of the mines was often in oxidized condition. I believe that some people found that this ore was actually out of equilibrium, that it would count much higher than it would assay. Do you think perhaps this was the case for some of the ore that might have been shipped out of White Canyon?
GS: I know this was the case of the Knotch Claims in the oxidized area, and it was the case in the other
100

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
places. Of course, they did have samples taken that were assayed, you know, which then would make this difference. I mean you would then know that--
SS: ---?--- not just counter machine.
GS: I suspect there probably was some imbalance there in
equilibrium. Dad and them had an old geiger counter, one of the first that Gordon Babel had put out, and it was just a set of earphones that you put on and you could hear the ticks in there. It didn't have a dial on it; it didn't have a light; all it had was a tube sticking out in front of just an aluminum box, aluminum colored with the tube sticking out in front attached to it, just screwed into the little box and this is the way they'd tell. They'd stick that on somewhere and how many ticks, whether it ticked quickly or not figure you'd tel1, and I 'm sure it wasn't the most accurate. There was no way to calibrate the instrument that I know of or anything else. It was a very primitive kind, and I suspect this probably led them to assume that the ore would be higher that it did. But there were samples taken. There were assays that went very high off from the outcrop.
ss: Did you have any idea how much tonnage the--from White Canyon mine and the Gone Away that might have
101

 DR . GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
been clinched down and stockpiled at White Canyon?
GS: I doubt if it was over a thousand tons. It may have been, but I doubt it.
ss: Well, after the White Canyon claims were sold and after that summer of '54 that you were involved down there, what other experiences and dealings did you have in the uranium industry?
GS: Well, the next winter, the winter of '54-'55 was a very great era of speculation in San Juan County, and there the interest was high enough so there was a demand for what came to be know as goat pasture claims. I mean there was a demand for any claims staked in San Juan County. You could probably have sold any claims staked in San Juan County maybe three deep, and there had been two people that beat you to
it--for a hundred dollars, and we found that there was a pretty good market for claims that we would stake anywhere we'd stake. We'd just go out of Mustang there or down the bottom of a canyon or anywhere and we could get at least three dollars for every claim that we had staked. We'd sell it to one of the people in the area who then probably sold it for a hundred dollars at least and who included, so I found out just recently, included the two or three hundred claims that we staked into a corporation that
102

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
he was forming and then charged a hundred dollars apiece, yet he got a hundred dollars a piece for the money that was being raised through the corporation
for these claims that he paid us three dollars to stake. So we spent the winter after school occasionally and occasionally during school--! got a D- in geometry that year because at noon, there was only going to be one class in the afternoon with the assembly for the rest of the afternoon, and Bob Payne, one of my friends who has come into the country as a result of the boom, he and I and a couple of my cousins and others had become very close friends. Bob Payne and I decided to take off and go stake some of these claims, and we went out the back door of the high school and snuck down through the 1ilac bushes and around and got down a couple of blocks away almost crawling on our stomachs. Then got up and thought we were pretty safe and took off. Apparently the high school principal had watched us all this time as we snuck along and all that, and so when we got back the next morning he called us in and told us that he had seen us leave and that we were then going to be docked for it and he sent a note to teachers that said we were to be--to have our grades cut as a result. Of course my grade was already low
103

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
enough that he cut, he should have given me an F plus I believe in the class and he was going to have me cut two grades for it. I talked Mrs. Stevens into giving me a D- instead of an F+. She looked me and she said, "Well, do you mean that would help you out?" I said, "Boy, that would be great if I got a D-
instead of an F plus," and so she kind of laughed and said, "Okay." And she gave me a D-, but we went out and staked a number of claims that afternoon and during the time up there in the winter and early spring; whenever it was fairly good weather and we felt like it. We could have made an awful lot of money and the fact that we didn't just shows a lack of motivation or something that wasn't because we had any scruples. So we spent a good time then staking claims, and that was an interesting part of the uranium industry.
SS: How much did you make that winter? Do you have any idea?
GS: No, I don't. But it must have been two or three hundred dollars apiece, and that was pretty good money for that time. We had all that we felt like we needed anyway. Whenever we needed any for any special thing we'd go out and stake some claims. We always
had a ready market for any of them we staked. Then 104

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
the next spring a man, one of the hundreds of men who had came to see Dad to buy claims from him--Dad, in addition to the claims that they had in White Canyon and Red Canyon, had two or three hundred more around and people were--they were in a great demand; he was selling a few around here and there. A man came and bought his whole ton Dinger claim that was worthless and gave him a couple of thousand dollars for it. He was there--I was very interested in this, you know, the dealing that was going on. Dad had made an agreement with me that I could stay in the room and listen to all of this big wheeling and dealing as long as I didn't interrupt. I knew that as soon as I made any noise at all I'd be out of the room and I wouldn't be invited back. So I would just sit there very quietly 1istening. This one man seemed to be quite interested. I think it was R. A. Stursick, he was a retired Navy commander during World War II and he had developed a number of businesses in Hines City, Florida. He had some land and orange groves and a few other things like this. He was fairly well off and he was a very benevolent kind of individual also. As Dad was talking to him I saw that he was quite interested in obtaining a number of claims, so that evening he was staying down in one of the cabins. I
105

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
went down and approached him with the idea of me and him and working into an agreement where he'd provide me with a jeep and a geiger counter and expense money and a salary and a royalty in the claims and I would go stake claims anywhere in San Juan County for him during the next year. He was definitely interested in this, interested to the point that he went back to
Florida, got a jeep in Florida and pulled it behind his car all the way out and got me the geiger counter (which I never used by that time--there wasn't any surface outcrop you could use a geiger counter on) and then he paid me, he worked with me for awhile. He was a geologist and a good geologist and a great
person, a very fine person to work around and with. He showed enough consideration, as a matter of fact, a few times I almost thought he never planned on making anything out of it. I think it was one of his philanthropic ventures for providing me with good experience and background. He worked with me and made sure that I knew all of the formations and knew everything that I should be looking for and all. Then he went back to Florida and just would send me a check and reimburse me for any expenses I had and
would send me fatherly advice once in a while. I went out and spent the summer of '55 out staking claims
106

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
then for Stursick. I put his name on many of them; I staked three or four hundred claims that summer. I tried to stake them in areas where it wasn't just great pasture. I staked them in areas where there had been some discoveries found closely. I picked the best claims that I could. I didn't stake any for him
just out on the goat pasture, but spent the summer then with a lovely jeep which he told me to keep when I was through, it was mine, and I enjoyed that for years after that. It was an excellent jeep, a beautiful jeep and a good expense account and enough money so that it was one of the more lucrative summers, but I enjoyed that kind of experience. I could go anywhere I wanted on the whole Colorado Plateau and stay as long as I wanted and stake as much as [I wanted). Beyond that we had a friendship that has continued throughout the rest of my life. He
was a strong motivator for me continuing on, going to college and continuing on through it. So that summer, the summer of '55 I did that, and then the summer of
'56 I was going to college that next fall at Brigham Young, so I was saving up money for that and I stared out this summer drilling, working on a drill rig with a man by the name of Bill Young and Jim Terrel, a good drilling company drilling. I spend the early
107

 DR .
GARY L. SHUMWAY #1
part of the summer drilling. We were drilling some of Dad's claims that he had sold in upper Cottonwood. He had sold them to the Ransom brothers; two brothers who had a farm implement and machine shop and all down in Roswell, New Mexico. They sold the business
to come up here with a couple of hundred thousand dollars to spend I think in getting a mining operation going. They had come to Dad and Uncle Seth and asked if they could start mining their upper Cottonwood claims. Dad and them had walked up there and staked these claims, but they weren't really sure, as a matter of fact they weren't sure at all that they were worth anything. I remember Dad telling the Ransoms that he thought they were pretty decent people and he wasn't sure, but they would lose their life savings in this and he didn't feel entirely good about letting them do it. They said they waited to and they understood the risk, so they worked out a deal where Dad and Uncle Seth would get a 20 percent override, which was a good deal for them. They had none of the risk and had to do none of the financing and got 20 percent of the net profit when it was through, which was a fair deal for property like this was. It had to have a long road built into it and everything, and these men went up and started. They
108

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
built a road into it and did a very minimal amount of stripping and found some good ore showing there and
started in on that. They had bonanzas everywhere they went up there and they came back to Dad and talked to them and Dad said, "They just told me they wouldn't
sell that for a million dollars," and a few weeks later they were offered five million for it. So anyway, they'd been developing these claims in upper Cottonwood and they decided to drill them. So I worked with Bill Young in drilling up there.
ss: What are some of the claim names up in Upper Cottonwood they worked on?
GS:
The two biggest ones were the King James and the King Edwards, which Clarence Rogers and Alma Jones and Uncle Seth had staked. Apparently as I hear one source but--I understand that Clarence Rogers and Alma Jones had decided to go up there prospecting. I don't know why, because neither one of them were prospectors in any sense of the word, but they decided to go up prospecting in this area and were all ready to go when Uncle Seth came driving up and asked them where they were going. They said they were going up Cottonwood and he said that he had been planning on going up himself that day, in Upper Cottonwood to prospect and suggested that they kind
109

 DR .
GARY L. SHUMWAY #1
of form a partnership with him throwing in his expertise in prospecting and then finishing the horses. I didn't know that they were overly enthused about the idea, but they certainly did lack the expertise and he had it. So they furnished the horses and went up and made these two discoveries that later proved to be more important at least in the early
initial production, would be more important to them. I don't know how they could go up when there's several miles separating these claims and how they could go up and just discover these two claims and not stake any other ones in between and have those two be the claims that proved to be so important in future years. There may have been more to it as a mater of fact then that. There may have been, these outcroppings may have been known by someone earlier or something, but that's what they did, they staked these two and possibly a couple more just next to them as cover claims and then came back and waited a year or so and then weren't very interested in them all. Dad and Uncle Seth decided to go up and look over the whole country, and they went up and left the two claims that Uncle Seth--they probably could have staked over them and claimed them because I doubt they'd done the assessment work. I don't know. But
110

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
they didn't restake those two claims but went on and staked the claims up and down, because there were outcrops showing up and down and some of them have since have proved to be good deposits also, but they had got these claims then into the hands of the Ransoms. The Ransoms were developing these when I went up there with Bill Young to drill them. Now they had been mining on the King James and the King Edward both and had good production there. I remember when I went up there and they had a stockpile on the King Edwards of 1,500 tons just sitting there, of good ore
and were producing like mad, but they wanted to drill in behind, and so we drove in across from the King Edwards first and didn't strike much of anything at all there. Then we went up across from the King James on the Avalanche claim and drilled one hole as I recall with only minimal success and then started drilling the second hole there. I believe it was just the second hole that we drilled, I don't believe it was the first. We were drilling along and all of a sudden black ore just started shooting at us. We were drilling with air and it just started shooting out the air pipe, just blowing out, just beautiful black ore. Dad had just gotten there and Mr. Ransom, Ray
Ransom had also just gotten there and we were 111

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
watching the operation when this came in like this, drilling. They sat there for a while and we turned off the drill and they looked at it and felt it and
sure enough it was ore. They had a 1ittle geiger counter there and they put it on it and sure enough it was good ore, so they were quite excited and they turned it on expecting it was a little streak going through. It just kept going and it kept going and it kept going, as we went down and down drilling, as we realized the size of the deposit they got more excited and finally Dad in a rare expression of emotion just reached down and grabbed some of it and threw it in the air and just yelled, "Whoopee, we've got it." Then he and Ray Ransom started hugging each other and dancing around in circles and they still just kept going and going and going and we finished and finally hit the red stuff there. When we finished to a point where we knew where in the Moenkopi we took out the probe that we had, a long probe, geiger counter with a probe on a long cable, and put it down the hole and found that there was 13 feet of ore there that would go over one percent the entire 15
feet, and so we realized we had a real bonanza there. That was the first time I'd been there when we had really drilled in to a bonanza. Dad of course was
112

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
very excited about it and the Ransoms were, so the next week Mr. Ransom had told me that he would very much like to help me come out and work in the mining operation. They needed more men very badly, and I wasn't entirely happy with working as a driller; I
didn't like it. It was boring work. I, everyday just had to push myself to go to work, you know. It wasn't the kind of thing that you look forward to doing, and I probably wasn't the most efficient driller's helper in the world either. So he came down and asked again if I would consider going to work. I told him yes, I would, and I went right that day out without even
quitting the other job, went out to work and spent the summer, the bulk of the summer out working as a loader operator in the mine. We had some big Michigan diesel loaders that we would run back into the mines and get a bucketful of ore, pull it out and either stockpile it or dump it in a truck if there was a truck there.
ss: Is that what's called a slusher?
GS: No, a slusher is air driven on a track is what we
usually think of. This had huge tires on it. You've seen the road making equipment and they are huge diesel loaders; they were too big as a matter of fact for the mining operation. You had to have the back,
113

 DR .
GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
you had to take a whole batch of waste just so that you could get these in and out, whereas if you would have had the back say six feet high you would have had a full face of ore all the time and there was
expense going into another three feet of just sheer waste, you know, that you had to move at all times. So this is what I ran for that summer and a couple of more summers and during Christmas holidays. This is what helped me get through college although Dad would have supported me entirely I'm sure, but this pretty well supplied the money for my college years. So that took care of that part. I had had a couple of mining experiences before that and after that, and my total mining experience led me to conclude that that wasn't my bag. In the vernacular of the bag. I had gone out with my cousin Dean and this friend Bob Payne, who were working for Merlin and Burdette Shumway out on the Payday claim. I had gone out there to work while Bob was sick one we'ek and I worked out there all week. The equipment was just so archaic, just so atrocious. It was just a cob job of the worst extreme, so you really had to be a pretty good
mechanic and be pretty used to the equipment even to get it to run. There were some functional problems with the equipment. You had to, in order to turn off
114

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
the shuttle buggies to run you had to get it parked and then jump off and run around and push a piece of iron on the spark plugs and ground it out on the side of it in order to get it to turn off, you know. The shuttle buggy that I was operating, the clutch would go bad on it that it wouldn't disengage very often. You just had to fight it to get it to disengage and
sometimes it simply wouldn't. This had created a number of problems. When one day I went out to dump a load of ore, Dean was back in the back of the mine, we had mucked it and loaded it up. I went out to dump it, and as I went out there'd been--
[END OF SIDE ONE]
And now for our---?--- that stopped you from going
into the bend that was on the edge of the cliff there. There'd been enough ore spilled that instead of hitting the log and stopping there it just ran right up onto the log. All of a sudden I looked and there I was looking down off that cliff with four hundred feet of cliff staring me in the face with me sitting right on the edge. I had to get that in reverse or it was just going to flip over off there. I was there just frantically trying to get it out of
forward into reverse and get it off and the clutch, of course didn't work on it. It didn't ever, but then
115

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
it didn't at all. I was there fighting and fighting, and slowly it just built up with my foot on the brake, slowly built up pressure so that it was just slowly edging off, and then all of a sudden it just flipped and the shuttle buggy flipped into the bend. It flipped me up in the air and I came down and lit with half my body on the outside of the bend and half in. A log crashed down and pinned me inside so I didn't fall out, but I sat there with that log across the back of me and I watched my mining hat just go around in circles, just swirl down and down and down and crash and fell on this rock below. I was just
held in with this log that was pinned across me there and I was just sick. I didn't feel very good anyway from the slamming down, and I had to dig myself out from under the log, dig down to the ore that was underneath it and get out, climb up there and go in
with no hat in the dark. I had to just stumble along, feeling my way along the wall and felt all the way back to where Dean was. Then I blurted out "Dean!" and I just about scared him to death because there was nothing at all that he could see: just pitch
black behind you. The only way you can tell if somebody's coming is if you see a light coming. To have someone just out of the dark you know, shout,
116

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
just about scared him to death. I told him what I'd done and he went out and looked at that and he was just sick because we were just petrified; they had he and Bob just terrified, so they just worked on sheer emotion, working every day. They had them so terrified that they were going to lose their job and all, and then we had to drive in. It was on the 24th of July. It was supposed to be a holiday anyway, and they hadn't come to work. They just told us they wanted to see all that ore mucked out when they got there the next day. So we drove in and I had to go up there and drive up and tell them that I'd wrecked the
shuttle buggy and the bin and the bin was inoperable, it put it out of commission and their shuttle buggy was in it and half in and half out. Boy were they mad. Oh man, where they mad. I always--! promised them that day that I was going to find enough money to repay them for the loss of equipment and the time that it took, because they couldn't work for two or three days after that and this really hurt them because they were--they made over three hundred thousand dollars that summer on it, you know, and this really hurts a person to be out of commission when you're making so much money and have got so much
high grade ore around you. I felt some obligation at 117

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY #1
the time. Since then I have rationalized it to the point where I haven't felt the same obligation to repay, felt 1ike maybe they ought to have had a little bit better equipment there. But that was my first real experience with mining that was rather distasteful. Then finally I, after having worked with the Ransoms, you know, in the Cottonwood claim there, ---?--- a couple of summers and sometime in between you know, I got away from it pretty well. I worked on oil rigs for a couple of summers during college and pretty well got away from the mining of it. The summer after I went on a mission for two and a half years. After I got back I got back just about a week and a half before school started, so I went out to mine for that week and a half out to ---?--- in Colorado with Duane Shumway, my cousin who was working there. I went out and Lark was very happy to give me a job, and I went to work. I spent [my time] in the mission field just talking to people for two
and a half years, and I was just desperately out of shape for any kind of physical labor anyway. I had put on plenty of weight and wasn't in good condition. We got there in the mines and I had never worked with a Navajo miner, before and my whole orientation in
life was that a white person was just several times 118

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
better than a Navajo under any circumstances. I got there in the mine and Lark told me to get down there and get to work. He was real gruff about it and I thought he was far too gruff as a matter of fact, because I had been quite anxious to see him. He had been the priest quorum adviser before I went in the mission field and he just told me to get down and get to work and quit standing around. So I went down and
started working. This Navajo started working and I started working and I assumed that it was my responsibility you know, the white man's better than- -to make sure that I several times outworked him in a day, and he started working when I started working and in 15 minutes I was just shot. I was just dead and he wasn't even warmed up yet hardly. All that day long I just worked like mad and I finally had to admit that I just wasn't even near that kind of man the Navajo miner was when I came in. That week and a half I worked there I just worked until every night I was so tired, even though---?--- we were starved to death--when we came up to the trailer we had to cook of course our own food. I was so tired that I was--
even though I was hungry also, I just decided that I would much prefer just falling onto the bed and going to sleep, which I did every night without any supper
119

 DR. GARY L . SHUMWAY # 1
or anything, and it was a very grueling experience. It didn't overly enthuse me about mining. Then my last experience, which was I suspect probably the last experience I'll ever have with mining as such, I had gone out in the summer of '61 I believe to work the Rex Claims with my two cousins and Bob Payne an old, the old friend of mine--
