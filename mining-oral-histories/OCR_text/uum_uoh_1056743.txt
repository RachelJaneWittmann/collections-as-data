 The following is an interview with Louis Hayne, conducted by Mitch Haddad, at the Kennecott Building, Salt Lake City, Utah, on August 4, 1970.
M: Okay, Mr. Hayne, the first thing I'd like to know is something about yourself.
L: Well, my name is Hayne. I am an attorney in Salt Lake City with offices in the Kennecott Building as you've already stated. Will that thing pick it up from here?
M:
L:
Uh huh.
I was admitted to the bar first in 1954, back in Idaho and in Utah back in 1955. I was a graduate of the University of Utah Law School in 1951. Before that time I had been working in a legal capacity
for a large oil company. In '54 was about the time the first
uranium boom started. So, I came back here and in association with two other attorneys we opened a small uranium brokerage office,
which mushroomed over a period of a year or so and then business fell off to nothing and we closed it up.
What did you call your b,1:okerage office?
M:
L: It was called Empire Securities Corporation. Then after 1957 roughly, I went back into the practice of law and that's what I've been doing since.
M: Now, you say that your prime, your main dealings with uranium industry have been in the area of securities. Now, could you tell me what some

 M: of the, for example, like during the boom when you were operating your securities and exchange and things, what were some of the main problems you encountered there?
L: Well, the biggest problem we had there was the fact that so many people were in the business that didn't know how to do it. I
suppose we were among them. We didn't really have the personnel
that were trained in bookkeeping and the various reports that were required by the SEC to be able to keep the control of inventories.
I know, as a matter of fact, that a number of brokerage houses
didn't know within 50,000 dollars where they were because the volume of business was so big. They didn't know the positions of those s.ecurities; that is whether they were long or short and whose account they really belonged to. They just mixed them all together under
the name of the security and when somebody came in and asked for their stock they'd just take it out of their boxes and hand it to them. So, bookkeeping was probably the greatest problem because
nobody knew at any time where they were.
M: You say that there's certain regulations; the SEC demanded them to be valid. Were these followed fairly close?
L: The bookkeeping procedures?
M: Wel1, the general procedures.
L: No, I don't think they were. No. Because most of the people in the business didn't know how. They would comply with the state regulations
page 2

 L: which at that time I think required about a 5,000 bollar bond. You put up your 5,000 dollar bond; you go take the securities test,
which amounted to practically nothing and all of a sudden you were
a securities dealer. Then came the National Association of Securities Dealers, the NASD which you may have heard of. They obtained the memberships of the various people who were in the business and they
as an inforcement agency among its members tried to teach the brokers how to run the busines.s. I suppose at one time there were fifteen uranium brokerage houses here in the city and out of that group I can only think of a couple that have survived. The rest of them have gone under or out of business mostly because of their in- ability to keep their books right.
M: Un huh. What was the biggest legal problem in dealing with the securities? I mean there was: such a fever for your penny stocks, your uranium stocks at the time. Didn't it cause certain legal problems?
L: Oh, let's see. The main legal problem you say? I guess the main problem that arose among the brokers was the problems that came up because of the failure on the part of the issuers. That would be
these little companies to either obtain a registration of the
securities or a resumption of registration. Then, of course, if you are dealing under an exemption like Regulation A or 3A-ll which is
the exemption, then you have the questions as to what all the promoters
do with their stock. In the first place, they weren't marking it
page 3

 L: properly with the restrictive stamps, and they would start, many
of them would start cranking it out with a machine, just issuing,
stock as fast as they could put it out and selling it to the public without any registration. Of course, you know there's a real fuzzy area in this business as to when you may or may not sell stock. The Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Ac~ of '34 (neither one of them are really clear as to what people can do) do not reg- ister their shares or do not follow the prime exemption. For instance, you've got Section 4 which talks about private transactions. When
may a person sell his stock and what is a private transaction..
When may a person sell his stock and what is a private transaction? Well, the SEC has got a few rules about it, but even they don't really tell you what you can and can't do. So, there's been a big report come up, oh, in the last few years in which they've tried to define this thing. In other words, if an insider has stock for two years may he sell some of it and if so, how much? May the legend come off the stock, may it be sold just to a private sophisticated buyer or can it be sold over the counter on the market generally.
All these things have never really been established. So back in
those days, everybody did as they pleased. I would say that there was a wholesale violation of the law going on. This is the biggest legal problem. The remedy, of course, is either a criminal penalty or the civil penalty provided under 10B5, Rule 10 of the rules of the com-
mission. Excuse me, Section 10 of the Utah Code, or the United States Code which gives you as a buyer the right to get your money back if
page 4

 L: you've been defrauded or as a seller the right to get your securities back if you've been defrauded . There ' s really a
very little bit of that. For every violation, I don't suppose for every hundred violations there was a singl e l awsuit , because
there were literally hundreds of little companies and hundreds of promoters and I suppose that most of them were out peddling their securities.
M: So there was kind of a random thing. I mean everybody wanted to get in on this type of thing.
L: Yeah. Most people in the business really didn't know anything about it. This went for the promoters, the companies, the prospectors with claims, and the people in the securities business itself. Of course, because of this, every kind of unscrupulous character you could name came into Utah during those days. You had ex-convicts and all kinds of people and the professional con-men. They were coming in rows getting into the act. Most of them are gone now. They were here
for a while.
M: Didn't this present a lot of problems there, I mean, a lot of people getting cheated then, right? Didn't some of them attempt to take court action or to ... ?
L: I suppose some of them are. I mean, I suppose some of them did al- though I know if you're dealing with the cookedy, it takes you, even if you get a judgment against him, you'll never catch him. So a lot of people just gave up in despair.
page 5

 M: The Salt Lake Exchange kind of totally depended on that uranium boom. I mean, you hear stories about how people actually stood in line outside the doors just to see, you know, or have stock issued to them, different other things. Was that really the situation?
I mean was there really that much of a fever?
L: Well, a lot of fever, but when you talk about people standing in line in front of the stock exchange it wasn't to buy securities that were on the exchange, but the biggest uranium broker of them all, I suppose was Lyman Cromer. He had his offices in the Stock Exchange Building. So when you talk about people lined up with money in their hands to buy stock in front of that building, it
would be to get into one of these offices that was in there, to buy new issues, but not stocks that were on the exchange. Salt Lake Stock Exchange at that time had made it mostly of mining stocks. We weren't members of that exchange. But a lot of these companies that were on the exchange did get involved in the promotion of uranium. But basically at the time they started, they were all involved in other minerals.
M: This primarily would be what was called over-the-counter stock transactions, correct?
L: Not the exchange.
M: No. I mean .¥.
page 6

 L: Those listed on the exchange are listed stocks and those that weren't would be over-the-counter stocks. Of course, none of the new issues were listed.
M: So this is all over-the-counter or penny stocks as they called them, right?
L: Some of them were penny stocks although some of them started out in the dollar area. Stocks like Lisbon and Federal were trading up in the area of five to twelve dollars. They were the exception. Most of them were stocks that started out at a penny or two.
M: What was the, you know like, you're told that my stocks went up four or five hundred percent; sometimes in one or two days. Does that, for example, like your company, your brokerage, did you see things like that happening?
L: Oh yeah. We saw stocks that went up much more than that. I remember a penny stock called Spencer Uranium and it went from a penny to
some 50 cents almost overnight, trading in the area up to 50 cents
went up to a dollar.
M: People were, now what was the general trend of the market? Were people buying these stocks and would they hold on to them or would they buy them quick and sell them quick as well?
L: Well, you've got, of course, two kinds of people buy stocks. You've got the man on the street who buys the stocks and you've got the
page 7

 L: broker who buys them for his, own account. The brokers are, of
course, in a sense traders. They played on the small margin for the quick turnover and they're in and out rather rapidly. While the
man on the street usually tries. to buy stock and hold it long
enough to get a capital gain. Of course, once you get the fever,
and it's still going up, you won't sell it even if you've got a
long term capital gain because you think it's going to go higher.
So a lot of the people who bought these stocks with the anticipation of big profits ended up holding them. Maybe still do. But most of the people, well, it's hard to say. There are all kinds of customers. Even people of the street begin to become traders. They buy hoping
to hold them two or three days and get out. The biggest problem the brokers had at that time other than bookkeeping was the business of colleetion. There's what you call Regulation T, which required that you collect them within four or seven trading days. If you don't then you've got to sell it out, and then you've got to penalize a customer. You've got to prohibit him from trading for a certain length of time and all that. Back in those days no one paid much attention to Regulation T and as a result of it several brokers lost thousands of dollars, maybe over hundreds of thousands on bad accounts. And so
we get into this kind of thing where we get people going into the market who expect to make big money and then lost their money, not being able to pay off. Because just as stocks go up three or four times in a day, they could also go down by 80 percent in a day or two.
page 8

 M: Now this brings to mind some of the large companies. For example, you mentioned that you know Charlie Stein quite well. His company was probably one of the what, larges t on t he market or s omething?
L: No, Charlie Stein's stock didn't trade.
M: It didn't?
L: No. Charlie Stein had some claims down on the rim and he, of course, was down there looking for what they call yellow cake, because this was the classic uranium ore that you had from Utah. Yellow cake
was a rather low grade ore but it is nevertheless profitable to mine
it. I'm talking about a real legitimate mining venture where you go into the ground and dig out ore and ship it and sell it and make a profit. Out of all the companies that were down there, there
weren't more than two or three that I know of that ended up making money. The rest of them were just promotions. They'd go out and
raise two or three hundred thousand dollars from the public and sometime they'd use it to go out and drill for mineralization and
most of the timeáthey didn't find it. In many cases, even if they
did find it they didn't know what to do with it. So, most of these companies really didn't give the people the real run for the money, other than the glamor of it. But some of them did; Industrial Uranium
has been a big shipper of ore and people that bought that stock initially made a lot of money. But Charlie Steáin's company wasn't that kind of a venture. He was down there as a graduate geologist
prospecting for yellow cake--I've forgotten what they call it.
page 9

 L: As he tells me the story, he was out south of Cisco. Some grocer there in Cisco was grubstaking him. He was out there drilling away
and all the time he was drilling up came what he thought was over- burden--black rock. And he'd just throw it aside hoping to get out into some yellow cake. So one day he had to go back into Cisco
which is just a little one grocery store, three or four people
town, although the people of Cisco may disagree, maybe it's more
than that. I don't know. It appears to be that there's only a
couple three houses out there. Anyway, he put some of this black rock in his jeep and headed in there and walked into the grocery store,
and the grocer, the fellow who had been grubstaking him was showing him his new geiger counter and so Charlie and he were admiring the g~iger counter and as they walked back out to the jeep they carried
the geiger counter with them accidently and as they got near the jeep the thing began to go crazy. Suddenly he realized what had happened. Re had been drilling through about 60 foot solid uranium mine which theretofore had only been found in Canada. He became so excited he began to run towards the little shack where his wife and children were living and hit his neck on the clothes line because he turned in the house and knocked himself out cold. The next thing he woke up, laying looking up at the sky. He said he thought he was dead. He was afraid it was all another dream. But it came to him again, and of course, innnediately, overnight, he was vastly wealthy because there was
$60,000,000 worth of ore on that one small area, I think just part of the claim.
page 10

 M: This is what he called the Mi Vida Claim.
L: Mi Vida, the Mi Vida Mine. Of course a number of people staked claims out around his Mi Vida Mine and then standard uranium which became a very, very, good mining operation too. Anyone in that area, the immediate area, found the uranium. It was a big, big deposit. Prohably the biggest single deposit of uranium in the United States ever. So Charlie took care of the people that had helped him, his family, his mother . . .
M: He had mortgaged almost everything. He was down to his last penny wasn't he?
L: There have been a number of stories told about him. He was down below his last penny; he was living on borrowed money, grubstake thing, see. So Charlie was a man with a big heart and he took care of everybody that even remotely had ever helped him in the past.
One time I was invited to come to Denver to represent a client who had a big lawsuit. So I got over there and it turned out to be Charlie Stein's mother. She wanted to sue him after he had given
her everything. She had her own private airplane and her own private pilot and all this stuff you know. Charlie had treated her like royalty, but on some hair-Qrained theory she had in mind because some people were provoking her who wanted to get in on the gravy, she had
it in mind that she wanted to sue him for more. Of course, I refused to have anything to do with it and she ended up hiring another lawyer in town who did in fact sue Charlie.
page 11

 M:
L:
M:
L:
Uh huh. I heard this.
I saw Charlie later about it. He was very kind and gracious about his mother. As a matter of fact I think he helped her even after that. After she sued him, again she came to him for help and Charlie gave it to her.
So, in essence, how did he lose all his money? This is a question that a lot of people are vague on.
Well, of course, Charlie could tell you that better than anybody else, but according to what he tells me, he lost it in a number of ventures. He dropped over a million dollars in a marble venture down in New Mexico. He, of course, continued to explore for ore and mineralization all over the world and undoubtedly dropped a lot of money there. He bought out an aircraft company. I don't remember which one. Do you remember Awako A irplane?
Uh huh.
I think that's the one he bought. He lost a lot of money in that and he just generally made bad investments; lost it all. Like I told you yesterday, a lot of what I'm telling you is hearsay. The only things I'm telling you are things Charlie told me about and a lot of them are my observations from conversations I've had with him too. But Charlie initially, oh he'd come up to Salt Lake and make speeches before the Bar Association, things like this. He had a real distrust
M:
L:
page 12

 L: of lawyers. He told tham if any of them ever came after him they'd better be prepared, because he was going to, you know, they weren't going to get him easy. He'd make statements like this, and of course, I suppose, you've got to understand the nature of the man because he'd undoubtedly had some experiences that were unpleasant to him.
M: Well, just how did you become friends with him?
L: Oh, I wouldn't say I'm really that close to Charlie as a friend. I met him initially through a friend of mine named Jennigs Phillips who's a public relations man here in Salt Lake. Charlie and Jennings have been very close and through the Mayor, J. Bracken Lee who used to be governor of the state and a very close friend of Charlie. Charlie used to take the Mayor and Jennings fishing in his fishing boat. He went to England and bought a converted boat of sIDme kind. I don't think it was a destroyer; I think it was sIDmething smaller than that. It was still a 60 foot craft and took it to lower California and would take his friends and his airplanes down there fishing for deep sea fish. Through Jennings Phillips and Mayor Lee, I met Charlie. I've been down to his home two or three times down in Reno. He's been a very gracious host and a very interesting man to talk to. So, I've seen him maybe a half a dozen different times in my life. I used to see him when he was up here in the state legislature. But he moved
to Nevada because he didn't like Utah income tax law.
M: I'll get to a final question, but yesterday you mentioned this shell game and what is going on now. For example, that involves Charlie
page 13

 M: Stein in many ways, like his claims. Many people are wondering whether or not his claims are staked now.
L: I don't know about that. I don't know that Charlie Stein has anything to do with the shell game. I would think not. In my conversations with him, he seemed to abhor the kind of thing that was involved in the
shell game business where the public was being hurt by what promoters were doing.
M: What is one? What does the shell game actually consist of?
L: Well, I don't know where the word came from. I suppose the word
'shell game' goes back to the old carnival act where a man would place
an object under one of three shells, like a half walnut shell, and
he would maneuver them around with his hands and get you to point to
the one that has the marble under it and make you a bet that you couldn't. That was the old shell game. With a slight of hand they would move the shells around. The word has been extended I suppose
to recent days to include what we call shell companies. Utah law was not, is not exactly the same as in some other states. For instance,
in Wyoming the corporation ceases to do business, it goes out of existence by proclamation of the governor. In Utah up to now, and maybe the legislature will change it, but up to now, if the corporation
was formed in Utah, then for one reason or another (usually failure
to pay your franchise taxes) and if for one reason or another that corporation has its charter suspended for nonpayment of taxes, it may
be revived by the payment of all deliquent taxes. So you've got a
page 14

 L: corporation that was formed say in 1955 and here's 1970. Maybe it paid its franchise taxes in '58 or '59 and the law permitted people to go back and pick up the 11 year deliquent taxes made by the pay- ment of $200 and you have an active corporation. Then I noticed a
lot of people picking up these old shells and getting control of
them, and now that the stocks have been out 12 years, why the normal rules that govern the selling of securities of the SEC have long since lapsed so people would begin to trade all of that stock as though it were registered, and a number of those companies then became active again and people started buying and selling the securities in com- panies that had no assets, none at all. Usually the buyer and
seller both knew it had no assets. But the buyer would buy, and I
can only guess on it, because the buyer would buy thinking, and know- ing its worthless, but if I hold it a few days it will go up and I'll get the profit cause somebody else will be buying at a higher price thinking he also can make a profit. Of course, that lasted for a year or so and it looks like it's over now.
M: Uh huh. Was there any legal action brought of this. I mean it seems
like it's as fraudulent as, you know, not as fraudulent~ but it seems like it is deceptive to say the least.
L: Highly deceptive. I don't know. I suppose it will be. I haven't seen any lawsuits that have been precipitated by this but the reason I know a lot of these old companies have been revived is because you can walk into any brokerage office and see the names of these old
page 15

companies on the board. In a number of cases I've asked the broker what assets they have and the brokers told me that as far as they know they don't have any.
Yet they're revitalized companies?
Yeah. Somet~mes they'll put assets into them. A number of these promoters will put assets of s_ome sort into them. It's always tough to find out why this is, but they'll talk about things.
People don't have to issue reports that states what their assets are, like fact sheets more of this type of thing?
I don't think they--I don't know. I doubt it.
So people are just kind of buying them on blind faith to say the least.
No, no, they're not buying them on blind faith.
They 're buying them on speculative blind faith, how's. that?
I think everybody that buys them is a little bit greedy. They're buying them though they're worthless figuring somebody else is
going to be just as greedy as they are and get them out at a profit. And for a while it was very true. Some of these penny stocks went up to ten or eleven dollars as.hare all overnight. If I had a sheet
here I could show you one of them. Well, for instance, in the law practice, I particularly notice it because very often you have a
page 16

 L: probate case. You know what a probate case is?
M: Uh huh.
L: Somebody dies and the court makes a disposition of their assets.
A number of my friends were involved in cases such as this. They were making inventory and appraisement at the time of death and in
that inventory they would make a list of a number of various stocks, all of which had no value. I'm thinking of one particular case, one particular stock; the estate had been closed for a year. You can't transfer these stocks without a court order cause they're in the name of the deceased person. So in one case they had a number of shares of stock that were absolutely worthless and within a year the market had started and these stocks had a value of a couple thousand dollars.
So the widow came in and said, 'Would you ammend the probate to permit the court to issue its order, so I can sell these securities because they now have value.' So the lawyer started to process the papers at the value of two thousand dollars and by the time he got them processed the stock had a value of 11 thousand dollars on the market. They sold at 11 thousand dollars and almost immediately it was worthless.
M: All the way up and all the way down.
L: Just like a roller coaster.
M: It's really an interesting--that was within the last couple years?
L: Within the last year.
page 17

    M: And so it's coming to a decline now.
L: I haven't noticed lately, but the last I looked was about a couple months ago, and just scanning down the list of stocks that I knew had a lot of, were suppos.edly trading at a lot of money a year ago, two months ago, were all down to practically nothing.
M: Uh huh. Well, cK.ay thank you."
