INTERVIEW WITH ANDREW HUNT CONDUCTED
GS :
AH:
Well , Mr. Hunt,
to me and tell me of your early experiences in the uranium industry. To begin with would you tell me your name, when you were born and where.
Andrew Hunt is the name. I was born in J arrow' s (?) just above here about ten miles.
What was the year?
I
IN HANKSVILLE,
UTAH ON AUGUST 14,
appreci ate your t aking time to talk
GS:
AH: The year I was born? That's a problem see. Just right
off the reel.
GS: Yeah. It was probably in the 1890s sometime there.
AH: W ell, I'm sixty--you see, I--
GS: That's all right. Let me ask you, you had mentioned
that you used to ride for Scorups when you were a
little boy. AH: Yeah.
GS: How did you get that job?
AH: Well, I just--they needed a ---?--- out working. I
was only about, let's see, fourteen, I believe, when
I started.
GS: And you worked over across the river or on this side
of the river?
AH: Well, we worked both sides, but mostly on the other
side.
GS: In the White Canyon area?

 ANDREW HUNT # 1
AH:
Yeah, White Canyon area. And they had a lot of cattle in them days in there, Scorups did. And I used to ride mail from here to Rite's. I think it was about that age, and that was quite a long old ride from
Hanksville to there with the mail.
How long would it take you?
Oh, it takes about twelve, fourteen hours. It's just, it's about sixty miles [south] on horseback. And I rode mail there--well, I was riding mail there about 1910. That's quite a while ago. I know the first time I took the mail down there when the river was high and had to go through right in the water on one place there, belly deep to horse for just a little ways around the bank. And I didn't know whether to tackle it through there or not. It was dark. They told me it would be dark by the time I got there, so I went right on down through the willows. You could just see it. You just couldn't hear anything for the roar of the water. And it was about one o'clock in the morning before we got in there.
Oh dear. But you did ford across the stream, did you? No, we didn't. I just went down along the side.
By the side. You could get over to Hite by going along the side?
GS:
AH:
GS: AH: GS:
AH: Yeah, yeah. It was just a ways there that you--the 2

 ANDREW HUNT # 1
water was running right out in the roads. And being dark it just--you have a little bit of road and that's about all.
And you were all alone?
GS: AH: GS:
AH: GS:
AH:
Yeah, all alone.
Uh huh. You were riding horseback instead of driving a wagon.
Just had a horse and mail sack.
Was this a job that you had been given or were you only doing it for someone else?
Well, there's a fellow here, John Noyes had a contract, mail contract, so I just hire out to him to
run the mail. And I guess they didn't have any rules or anything about age. But anyway that was quite a problem at first when I was so young, see.
Yeah. When you were over there riding cattle--
[interruption] We had a little interruption here, Mr. Hunt, but I was going to ask you, when you were over there riding cattle, were you ever aware of the Happy Jack Mine that was there?
Yeah, we camped a lot out. There was a copper deal there. They were digging copper and hauling it, taking these on a boat and then they was hauling it out from there. And I don't know where they were taking it, but they hauled it across--the copper that
GS:
AH:
3

 ANDREW HUNT #1
was there at White Canyon Mine.
GS: And they were there mining it while you were there? AH: Well, they'd been digging some. It wasn't steady mining, but they had some there off and on, just
taking out, but it wasn't a very fast mine.
GS: Do you remember anybody that was involved in that or
did you ever know who was doing it?
AH: Well, I don't. I don't remember who was doing it. But
anyway, they were hauling it on wagons from Hite through here, and I don't know even where they were taking it.
GS: You remember that when you were out there cowpunching though?
AH: Yeah. We camped there quite a lot.
GS: Was there a spring there?
AH: Yeah, there was a little water there. And this
Scorup--well, he went down--the first time I seen Al Scorups, he was waiting for me to bring in some horses, some saddlehorses. And I remember down there under the ledge and his hair was that long. He wanted me to know if I cut hair, and I'd told him, yeah, I'd get that off.
GS: Y ou'd sheared enough sheep.
AH: So we had a pair of sheep shears is what we had. They
cut a horse's mane. So I gave him a hack. We're right 4

 ANDREW HUNT # 1
under the ledge in the shade there. Neil was---?--- and that was my first time with swimming horses.
GS: You swam the horses across the river?
AH: Uh huh.
GS: Well, I'11 bet that was quite a job across the
Colorado. AH: Yeah.
GS: It was too deep for them to touch.
AH: Oh yes. It was way deep. Down there it's, oh, I guess
forty feet in places. And they'd swim from one place
to the other.
GS: How would you get horses to swim across?
AH: Well, the main thing, you had a boat there, went with
the horses and let them swim and handle them along with the boat. That's the way it was with the saddle horses.
GS: You'd lead the first ones. Have hold of the bridle as you were in the boat?
AH: We'd lead the horses right down in there. The horses at the time were ---?--- But anyway we got them across, just swum. We rode in the boat to take them across.
GS: What did you do? Start quite a ways up stream and then go and--?
AH: Yeah, kind of a long space there and we just, oh, 5

 ANDREW HUNT #1
just didn't have any bother with them at all.
GS:
AH:
About this same time you got involved in the uranium business. Can you remember how it was that you came to get involved?
Well, we got this uncle of mine, Horace (?) Robbins, he was tinkering with the uranium a little. I happened to work for him. He had cattle, too, there
in Four Corners. I was helping him with cattle and digging with the uranium too. I kind of got to where I like it pretty well, and I went into the business, been digging uranium ever since.
Who did you sell the ore to when you had it dug out? Well, I couldn't tell you that, but he sold it somewhere. I don't know just where he sold it.
Uh huh. And what kind of percent did you have to have in order to make it profitable?
Well, I know we had to have better than one and half percent or else we wouldn't take it. And we done a lot of our mining just with a single jack, taking it that way. And then we had these gabs, we called them, just picked out the high grade.
This was kind of a chisel or something like that? Yeah, just a chisel and a hammer. And judy dig it out where it was the best, see.
GS: AH:
GS:
AH:
GS:
AH:
GS: Were you looking for high-grade trays? Is this what 6

 ANDREW HUNT # 1
it was mainly or--?
AH: Well, yeah, because you see, you'd have to throw away one and half percent before you could take it. So we had to kind of hunt the high grade, you see.
GS: Well, where was this that you were mining?
AH: That was at Temple Mountain. It had to be pretty good
ore to get it above one and half percent.
GS: So you threw most of it just over the dump then?
AH: Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, we just drive the drift in and
then take the highest grade. We'd take everything
that was, well, one and half percent.
GS: How did you--what method did you have of knowing of
whether it was one and half percent or above? Could
you just tell by looking at it?
AH: Well, no. We had a little old machine quite a lot
like that there.
GS: Looked like the tape recorder, huh?
AH: Yeah. But it had a little old dipper off in here and
it was glass top, and there was a hand down in there that would show you percent. And anything that was any lower than one and half, we'd just throw it out.
GS: So how often would you test this to know how it was running?
AH: Wel1, we had to test it every drift ful1, you see, and then if it went above one and a half, why, we
7

 ANDREW HUNT #1
took it, and if it didn't, if it was below that, why, we just dumped it as waste.
Would you wait until you had a big pile of ore there before you test any of it, or would you test every sack that you got out or--?
Well, we'd test every night, every evening. Once a day. Of course, digging the stuff out we had a pretty good idea on it after we got used to it.
You got to where you could tell what was high grade and what wasn't pretty well.
Uh huh. I don't believe I'm doing you any good.
It's great, very interesting. It really is. There's no one left around that could tell us these kind of things. Did you ever have any problems with your method of assaying? In other words, did you sometimes think that your ore was running one and a half percent and find out that it wasn't?
AH: Well, it either would or it wouldn't. It must have been just like today's outfit. It just told what it was and that's about all.
GS: It was pretty accurate, in other words.
AH: Yeah it was pretty accurate. And we didn't seem to
have any bother with it anyway.
GS: What kind of problems did you have mining at that
time? What were the problems that you encountered? 8
GS:
AH:
GS:
AH: GS:

 ANDREW HUNT # 1
AH: Well, of course, we shot it with powder, see.
GS: Black powder?
AH: Black powder and also the other. And that's what we
run our drift with. And of course, we didn't make drift very fast. A lot of it anyway was just single drift.
GS: You didn't have any jack hammers at all at that time? AH: Well, we eventually had some jack hammers, but then we did most of the drifting of ore just with these
chisels.
GS: With a single jack.
AH: Yeah, a single jack.
GS: Did you ever sell any ore to Standard Chemical
Company?
AH: Well, I think this probably was. Of course, I was
just a kid and I didn't have much say so, but I think they did.
GS: Uh huh. You remember when the Standard Chemical Company came in?
AH: Oh yes.
GS: Did they have a mill? I believe they had a mill over
here, didn't they?
AH: Yeah, they had a mill there.
GS: Where was that?
AH: Well, it's right where you first hit the Trachyte(?)
9

 ANDREW HUNT #1
Creek, is right upon the ledge, right upon the Trachyte Creek where the road crosses. And there was a lot of good ore there, all around. I don't know as I done any of that work on the mill, but I dug a lot of ore out there.
GS: Uh huh. After the mines closed down in 1923, you know, when they lost the market for radium. What did you do then?
AH: Well, I just farmed a little, and jobs, different things.
GS: You quit mining at that time?
AH: But, I know we quit for a while, but it wasn't too
long till we could sell it again. And we, of course,
your claims held anyway.
GS: You did the assessment work on your claims?
AH: Yeah, we done work on the assessment.
GS: Do you remember how long it was? Was it the 1930s
before you started selling it again, or did you sell
some along throughout this time?
AH: Well, I don't remember when they did start it again
or anything. I never paid much attention, but I know there was a period there where you couldn't sell it, and you didn't sell it.
GS: Do you remember the Metals Reserve Period in the World War II?
10

 ANDREW HUNT #1
AH: GS: AH:
GS:
AH: GS:
AH: GS: AH:
GS: AH:
GS:
AH:
Yeah.
Did you sell some during that time?
Well, I'm not sure. I didn't pay a great lot of attention to it.
Uh huh. Then you continued working through in it almost to the present time you've been in the business.
Yes, I worked on this off and on ever since 1910.
I talked to your son about your experiences with Vernon Pick, and that must have been quite a time, wasn't it?
Yeah it sure was. I'd like to have it to go over. You'd like to have a chance at the Delta Mines again? Yeah, you bet. I think we still got a better mine up there then his turned out to be.
Is that right? Build on the other side of the canyon? Yeah. I think there's still more ore in that mine of ours that we've kept holding there than what he got out of his.
Huh. Have they drilled any on this one that you're talking about?
Well, there was some drilling, but we haven't done too much on it. We just kind of kept a holding it and doing a little work. We'd have to get up on some drilling, see. And we have a drill, but we couldn't
11

 ANDREW HUNT #1
reach it with the drill we've got, but if we get up on top there, of course, there'd be quite a ways to drill. I believe we'd have a lot of ore.
Hm-m. Do you have some outcrop there showing?
Oh yes. Yeah, we have some outcrop. Been a little drift through there, a slip.
A fault of some kind.
Fault, yeah. It kind of cut us off. We haven't had the money to go at it and drill it. So we're just keeping it and hoping we'll get money enough to go on with it.
Oh great. What's the name of this claim?
Bluebird.
And it's right out by the--
It's joined right on to the other, on the other side. And we took some wonderful ore out of there till we hit this fault, see, and we've kind of lost the ore, up or down. I don't know which way to go on it. But then it's going to take quite a little time to find it. But we've got the channel right there that just goes right into the lake.
got this new process now for drilling in; you can 12
GS:
AH:
GS: AH:
GS: AH: GS: AH:
And you have the mine back in aways underneath.
GS:
AH: Yeah, we took quite a little ore out of there.
GS: Have you ever tried long holing it? You know, they've

 ANDREW HUNT # 1
drill two hundred feet or go straight in.
AH: GS:
AH:
Yeah. We've never tried it that way.
That may be better than getting clear up on the wind gate above, you know, and drilling down.
It would. It would do it. It would because you'd know your formation would be there, which way it slips. And we just haven't done any of that. It would cost
us quite a little bit to do it. But I think we've got some wonderful ore there if we just get through that slip.
Great, great.
But it's just the same channel right through and cut it off in the slip.
Did you sell this during the boom? Did you ever have a chance to sell it or anything?
Well, no we didn't. Only just what we mined. We mined it. But we never sold it. And it was, we just thought maybe we'd keep a-mining it and develop it, see, is
what we thought. We couldn't get too much out of it, just like I said. But I'm just sure that if we'd go ahead and pick the vein up, it would be better than
GS: AH:
GS:
AH:
the other one because it's on the down drift.
GS: Huh. And that's what happened to the Delta Mine was
that it just pinched out up drift, didn't it? AH: Yeah, that's right.
13

 ANDREW HUNT #1
GS: AH:
GS:
AH:
Uh huh.
And this is good ore up until the slip and I know if we got by that, we're on the down drift and I know
it'd be better ore.
Didn't, you know, when Atlas bought out the Delta, bought out Vernon Pick there, didn't they show any interest in your claims across there?
No, they, this was a lot better up on the Delta. Right over against it, we had quite a time finding where to go. We done quite a lot of drilling in there, but it's all shook up and wouldn't do much about it.
Uh huh.
Oh we could have sold it, I guess.
But you felt like there was a good enough chance that there would be something there.
Yeah, we wanted to develop it so as we could get something out of it.
Hmm. Well, you've had a great lifetime in the uranium industry.
Yeah. I didn't get a hell of a lot out of Pick though.
GS: AH: GS:
AH:
GS:
AH:
GS: No, you sure didn't. Do you expect you got your fair share out of it?
AH: No. No. He just swiped it. While we were making the 14

 ANDREW HUNT #1
mine, Kay and I, why, he was finding out how he could get us out of it so he finally got the iand.
GS: And you actually felt sincerely that you were joint partners in that venture?
AH: Oh yes, yes. And when he come to see where we stood, why, we didn't have anything. We had the mine al1 made for--
GS: You were the ones that were doing the work out there. AH: Yeah, we were furnishing all the jacks and stuff. And
so he just scooped us out. We felt like that he was, had a 1ittle good sense. I guess he had plenty of sense but then he offered me a partner. I was half interest in it, see. So Pick, he just rooted me out. From the start with the first time I met Pick, I was running cattle down here, he stayed there at the ranch. He got broke down out in the desert.
GS: What was he doing out here?
AH: Well, he come down and just going through the
country.
GS: Was this during the boom or was this earlier?
AH: Yeah, this was just before the boom. And so I'm out
in the desert there and drug his car in and fixed it up, got him on the go and loaned him fifteen dollars. So he sent that back, the money. And I thought, well, hell, he must be something like a man, so I just
15

 ANDREW HUNT #1
trust him. But when that much money came up, why, there ain't no man about him.
GS: You think it was just a case of seeing all that money staring him in the face and knew he could have it if he beat you out of it? Do you think this was what it was?
AH: Yeah. I don't know what he thought, but then I wouldn't have done it.
GS: The reason--why did you let him do this you know? Did you just trust him enough?
AH: I just trusted him enough that he just got the hold of it, that's all. You can get a paper, a book on it now.
GS: Yeah, I understand there's a book. AH: ---?--- Hayes told all about it. GS: Yeah. Uh huh.
AH: That's in this book.
GS: Yeah, that's quite a story. That's a real story. There's some feeling that maybe his story of going down there and almost thirsting to death and getting carried away by a flood and a few things like this. Maybe this wasn't exactly true or--
AH: No, it wasn't. Hell no. He supposedly went down there on the raft and all of that, well, that's just nonsense. There wasn't any water in the creek. The
16

 ANDREW HUNT # 1
only way he could have went down there in a raft was in a big flood or something.
Uh huh. And if there was a flash flood out there, you wouldn't want to be out there in a raft of any kind. No, no, I wouldn't.
What about his discovery of it? Was he a good enough prospector to locate that himself or did he have a
GS:
AH:
GS:
AH:
GS: AH:
GS: AH: GS:
AH:
GS:
little help?
No, no. I had to locate it. And through changing the deal a little, why, that's why I lost it. I thought maybe he'd be a man, but he wasn't, he fixed up the contracts. He was too fast for me.
How did he change the deal?
Well, I don't remember just how it was, but anyway, he just slipped it out from under us.
Uh huh.
Me and Kay both.
Well, that's certainly too bad because you've been in it so long you deserved a break like that. That's for sure.
Yeah. I put up the papers on it myself. Pick didn't do it.
And it had your name as well as his on the original
papers?
AH: That's right.
17

 ANDREW HUNT #1
GS: How did it work out that your name didn't appear then
on the papers.
AH: Well, he just didn't show it up. He left it out or
something. I don't know.
GS: Well, I certainly hope that your mine across there
turns out great. It would be wonderful if it did.
AH: Well, I'll get along all right anyway without it.
GS: Yeah.
AH: Still get along.
GS: Do you have a ranch here in Hanksville?
AH: Yeah, and one in Green River.
GS: Oh?
AH: I stay in Green River most of the time.
GS: I see.
AH: And, of course, we've got a lot of claim out through
here. I'm working in them a lot.
GS: In the copper also?
AH: Yeah.
GS: I understand you've got some real great copper.
AH: Yeah, it is. I guess we sold it just lately now.
We're just kind of fixing up the deal. It's a mighty good mine, but we're going to be a little more careful than we was before.
GS: Gonna to look at the contract before you sell it, huh.
18

 ANDREW HUNT # 1
AH: GS:
AH: GS:
AH:
GS:
AH:
GS: AH:
GS: AH:
Yeah.
Well, copper's, what, sixty cents a pound now, isn't
it?
Yeah, and going up.
Yeah. Boy, I'll tell you, you can make money on that with a mine like you've got out there.
I would. This is a big thing out here. Copper for two or three miles, just pretty copper.
And it's in the igneous--
Igneous.
---?---
Yeah. And we've got holes in there 150 feet, drill holes. Just as green and pretty. So I believe this is going to be a real mine.
Are you keeping a royalty on it when you sell it? Yeah, our people are sure we've got a hold of something anyway.
Yeah.
But it's a big thing for copper here.
Where is this?
In these mountains right over here. The Henry Mountains?
The Henry Mountains.
GS:
AH:
GS:
AH:
GS:
AH:
GS: Uh huh. Up on the side of them.
AH: No, it's right up on the top of them, the basin wide. 19

 ANDREW HUNT #1
And, oh, I'd say there's two or three miles there that you can just pick up copper right on top of it, but it's never been drilled. A deep drilling is what these people want to do. I don't know what we got, but then we're keeping the royalty.
GS: Great.
AH: And of course, we're still getting their minerals.
GS: Well, I hope you do. I really do. Thank you very
much, Mr. Hunt. I've enjoyed talking to you.
AH: Well, I don't know if I've done much good.
GS: You certainly have.
AH: If it had been a few years back, why, I kind of had
a stroke, and then before that I could have told you
a lot of things. GS: Yeah.
