 THE FOLLOWING IS AN INTERVIEW WITH H. BYRON MOCK CONDUCTED BY MIT CH HADDAD AT THE CONTINENTAL BANK BUILDING, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH ON AUGUST 11, 1970. [THIS INTERVIEW IS A PART OF THE URANIUM INDUSTRY ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM.]
MH: Okay, Mr. Mock, the first thing I 'd like to know is a little about yourself, please.
HM: Well, I'm a lawyer here in Salt Lake City. But I guess you're interested in what I was doing during the time the uranium boom was on. I was at that time
(for a while) the head of two states for the Bureau of Land Management. I was the Regional Director for Colorado and Utah which were two of the more prominent uranium states. That was from 1946 or early 1947 until 1954. And in 1954 I became the regional head of Idaho, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. Subsequent to that, about 1955, I went into private practice, and I have never gotten far away from the public land problems of the country. In fact, I practice natural resource law both here in West and in Washington, D.C. Is that about enough of the background you need?
MH: Uh huh. You graduated from Georgetown Law School, correct?
HM: Well, I took my undergraduate degree at the University of Arizona in Tucson, and took my law degree from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. in the late thirties. Going back there as so many did as an office employee of a--in t hat case a

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
Congresswoman from Arizona, Isabella Greenley, who was connected with mining. And then subsequently I became the chief counsel of the grazing service. Well, I was with the Interior on the Indian law and several other assignments. And just before the war I became the chief counsel for the United States Grazing Service, which was later merged with the BLM, and had just been merged when I came back from the army four years later in 1946. Outside of that--
In what states are you admitted to the bar? Just Utah
MH:
or--?
HM: No, I'm admitted in Utah, and the District of
Columbia, and in Virginia, and I guess most of the federal courts, the United States Supreme Court on down.
MH: Now in a discussion of the uranium industry, there are certain problems area which come about legally. Probably starting with your association with the Bureau of Land Management, what were some of the first problems that you encountered there?
HM: Well, the basic program of developing the natural resources, the fissionable source materials--well, the problem arose that the AEC, the Atomic Energy Commission, _had a great need to develop raw material and they were short on it. In fact, there were
2

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
predictions and thoughts at the time that there probably wasn't an adequate supply within the boundaries of the United States and that we might be dependent on foreign countries. However, there had
been a great deal of activity over in the Bowl Canyon area of Colorado. In fact, they had found the source materials there for Madame Curie and others who did the research, oh, before World War One. They had taken a lot of their source materials from Colorado. So we knew we had some. The Atomic Energy Commission under the basic law that had established it was in theory the owner--in trust of the United States, of course, as the representative of the United States-- of all fissionable source materials found in the ground. The basic law provided that no one could acquire the title to them. And the implication was pretty clear that it was almost the taking over those source materials if they were found on private property. But the law was never so interpreted. If they were found inside the federal lands, however, the question immediately arose as to how they could be made available. And more seriously the question arose as to how you would find them. In order to get an adequate amount of research going, the Atomic Energy officials, commission officials, decided not
3

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
to go the leasing route in which they would issue leases either competitively or on any other basis to people who came in, but decided that the best route was to allow mining claim locations to be utilized and to give the benefit to those who went out and
looked and found. This was the system that was adopted. It was the result--I was mixed up in it, because I was representing the federal government as custodian of the lands and the agency that was administering the mining laws. I was mixed up in it to try to straighten it out so that it became a solid legal title for the benefit of those that acquired it and worked hard to develop it. I think here you can
identify something many people have forgotten, that the incentive held out to mining locators to go out self-initiate a right and to run the risk and also the opportunities of benefit was probably the greatest force that was mobilized in order to assure us of an adequate supply of fissionable source materials to support the Atomic Energy Program. The success of it, I believe, is self-evident. And in time they reached the stage that good portions of the western United States were not only being staked and covered by mining claims, but the land was being drilled by a multitude of people and tested by this
4

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
multitude in a way that could never have been done by any organized and government-financed program. As a
result of it, we got the major reserves developed, and in time the Atomic Energy Commission was able to back away from its incentive programs to look and begin to stabilize its operations. Now it was about 1955, I believe, that the Atomic Energy Act was amended to reflect what the Atomic Energy Commission had adopted as a policy; namely, to recognize mining claims that were located on the public domain as being valid. The initial argument, in which I was a party because it didn't make sense, was trying to help people get things straightened out. The original argument was that if you located a mining claim and had fissionable source materials in it, you could get the fissionable source materials. The Atomic Energy Commission insisted that this was valid because there were other minerals in association with those
fissionable source materials. And if they were found in association, then the location of these claims for these other minerals would allow them to take the fissionable source material, or uranium, as well. Well, it worked pretty well as a matter of policy for probably less than a year, and then they began to find uranium pockets that were not associated with
5

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
other minerals and the question was, where does the law lead you at this point? It certainly led you to the point that mining claims were probably not valid, and yet nobody was questioning them and--as a result the mining claim operation continued, and finally because of the urgency and the basic public interest that was represented by developing these resources, the law was changed to validate--in theory to validate the mining claims that had been located for fissionable source materials prior to that date. I think it was a healthy thing. I think it should have been done a long time before and I think the end result certainly was in the best interest of those who had been enticed to go look for uranium with the hope that they would get the benefit of what they
found and produced. And it would have been unconscionable for the government to have taken those benefits away them at a later date by some interpretation of the law that was different than what had been held out to them. I think this particular point and problem identifies one of the major difficulties in dealing with the federal government because one of the best established rules that we know in practice is that no one has the right to bind the United States government contrary to its
6

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
own best interest, no matter how much they may have had in the way of a official position allowed them to make promises to citizens. And then when somebody changes his mind and decides they shouldn't have made a promise to them, to take away the benefits that those people had acquired in reliance on the promises of the government officials. I think the Atomic Energy Commission did a terrific job at this stage, and anything less than the critical emergency developing uranium deposits and the adequate natural resource reserve in that probably would not have been sufficient to overcome the normal tendencies to deny citizens the benefit of their efforts. Now the thing that happened very quickly was that the old mining laws, 1872, which started out to take care of lode deposits and clearly defined veins, and then had been broadened out almost immediately to cover the placer deposits which would be the secondary deposits of the minerals, out from the lodes and veins where they normally would appear in their initial concentrated stage, the old laws of 1872 had not been set up to take care of this broad type of deposit that was found in the uranium field. We know that a lot of them were nothing more than just pods. And you found a small deposit and you might mine right through it
7

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
in almost no time at all. But not all of the uranium deposits that were found were of high grade. And it required large reserves in order to make it possible to mine and extract the uranium from the ore. As a result of this, two things happened. People went out to look and they tried to cover as broad an area with their mining claims as they could. In fact, sometimes in places like Wyoming you might see twenty thousand mining claims all pronounced as being lode deposit claims that were immediately adjacent, not laid out with any particular pattern as to direction and width of the lode or a vein and the outcropping on the surface, the so-called apex, but just blanketing the whole country, and doing it under the guise of lode deposit. It really didn't make a lot of difference
whether you called them lode or placers except that the laws had always recognized that if you located a placer deposit under a lode claim or a lode claim under a placer deposit you didn't get it. And as a consequence everybody was being pretty careful and sometimes was filing both types of claims. But it was the broad breadth of these claims that became so critical. They were covering just the entire countryside. And then the only operations of the mining laws that had come into play; namely, you must
8

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
have a discovery before you can protect it against another locator on each claim, and that you must pick your assessment work up annually after you've made your discovery to prevent someone from relocating it,
just plain weren't working. Because with these large extensive locations the holders of them would try to start an orderly development of drilling at one end and working down towards the other end. And by the time they got to the middle somebody else was probably parked there claiming a prior discovery. So you ran into a lot of problems of that kind. And the second thing was that the large number of claims that were located even if assuming a discovery had been made on each, had to be maintained by doing on or for the benefit of each claim a hundred dollars worth of work e.very assessment year. And at the end of that year, if you hadn't done it, even if you had filed a notice that you had done it, but the only question really that was important was whether you had or had not done it. And if you had not, someone could go in there and locate over it and take the benefit of that claim away from you. Now this would tear the pattern of blanket holding into shreds. Well, we got a lot of misuse of the mining laws under this because they had not been set up to take care of these large wide-
9

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
scale type of developments. And we got a lot of abuses doing the assessment work and even the discovery pits that were required in many states. Take Wyoming, for example, where you had to have a pit that was fifty feet long, or whatever it happened to be, six feet deep at the deepest point exposing the face of the so-called deposit. And they just hired--the miners just hire bulldozers to go out there and scoop up a deep ditch at the parallel--at the end lines between two claims and run a ditch, and claim they did the discovery work for both. As a result of this the ranchers who had had the surface of the countryside in use for grazing purposes got pretty irate, not because they were against mining, but because they were doing so much damage to the surface that it could create a hazard for the wild-- for the livestock as well as the wildlife, that it seemed unnecessary. They got pretty irate. Some of them were assuaged by the simple process of demanding that they be given an overriding interest in any uranium deposits that were developed. And while the deposits were owned totally by the federal government, and they were under the public land, and
the surface user was merely a permittee, 1icensee, say, under the T aylor Grazing Act for grazing
10

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
privileged, and had no right to any return to the mineral development; just the sheer harassment caused a lot of mining people to give an override to these surface users, permittees. Well, this added another burden that eventually complicated things. It caused a lot of people that thought that the federal government should be getting all the benefit of any such payments to get upset with the ranchers. But the mining laws as they were written were very simple. You paid so much an acre for a lode deposit--five dollars an acre for when you patented a lode deposit and never paid any royalty. And you paid two and a half on your placer deposit when you patented them and never paid any royalty. So the return to the federal government was not direct. It had to be calculated in terms of the economic base of the area and of the nations and the gross return, which was not inconsiderable I might say, through the income tax and other tax procedures that applied to the development of new wealth wherever it might be, whether it came from federal lands or otherwise. That's not a problem that we need to discuss, but I think it's one that is sometimes ignored. That the failure to collect a royalty was not necessarily a denial to the governmental agencies of the benefit of
11

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
the exploration and development. In fact, quite the contrary. Anyway, I think we come back I think fairly quickly that the system that was set up, then adjusted and put into operation to take care of a new type of deposit and a new type of widespread relatively low grade ore worked. And it created a lot of problems in the process of it that ended up with criticism of the miners for having abused the surface and wasted the resources, and certainly they did. But that was the system, and I think it's a tribute to our own American ingenuity and the soundness of our planning and thinking that when a different type of situation arose our establishment was able to adjust and absorb it in the best interest of our country. Now you look at the results of this. I personally date the uranium boom and the excitement on locating these broad areas and the developing this new
invaluable deposit as a forerunner of the time when we had to have some revision in the mining laws of the United States. We've come to a new period and a new time--and I'm not only talking about the different types of mineral deposits, I'm talking about the changing of the attitude on the surface management. Many of the activities did lead to a recognition that maybe other valuable resources of
12

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
the United States were being wasted in the process that to where the waste could be avoided. I think that the late forties saw the beginning of what is now culminating in a rather vigorous crusade to
revise the mining laws. And this isn't the first time the problems has arisen; it's not the first time there's been a lot of excitement about it. But as of now we're starting to run into a couple of lines of argument that would not have been possible during the uranium boom. One of them is that we really don't need to increase our resources, and if we just stop expanding the gross national product and the resource development of the country, we will tend to resolve our problems on environmental control and pollution threats. And therefore, let's just stop developing new resources. We really don't need them. Now this to my mind is a ridiculous conclusion. But what is ridiculous to one may seem gospel to another. And I have seen too many people very strongly commenting along these lines that we should stop this type of resource development. It hasn't happened in the uranium field as such to my knowledge. I would identify since 1955 until now a change in the uranium development that I would summarize as being the
passage of the initial exploration push, crunch or 13

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
binge carried on by many small operators typical of the early day prospectors, if you will. People who were willing to risk every thing to make a big successful find, and many of whom did, but most of them didn't, being fragmented into a large number of
small companies. They could have been the little penny-stock uranium companies so many of which were strictly promotional, some of which became quite legitimate and became very valid contributors to the development of our resources. Others were merely mining the public. But even some of those turned out to be successful much to their own surprise. The period since 1955 has largely been one in which the little holders are gradually being consolidate into big holders. We find almost a waiting period in which this consolidation has been going on quite steadily until the control of uranium development has been going on quite steadily until the control of uranium development has been much more highly concentrated than it was in the early stages. I have no figures that would identify the number of major companies that are interested in uranium, or the mortality of the number of small companies that were interested and no longer are around. But I think that it's quite obvious that the expenditures must be quite great,
14

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
and that the concentration around mill developments, the competition for the market, the development of new uses, the overcoming of the resistance that is built to the--or the morbid fear of the use of
fissionable materials because of the threat that we might have an accidental domestic Hiroshima, Nagasaki. All of things are part of our national picture, they're part of our mores, if you will, they're part of our fears, they're part of our hopes. And so these things have had to be overcome, and I
doná't think small operators do it. I think it has required a consolidation of holdings into an adequate size to allow the expenditures and efforts that are necessary for continued development. Now the present proposals on the mining laws that have come to a head in the last twenty years or more--twenty-five, let's say, because I'm talking from my own experience, and I know how actively these things have been on kind of a surge basis since 1948 is the date that I fix as the real ákickoff on this. The current tendency on the revision of the mining laws is to provide a means of acquiring a large enough area to allow an adequate exploration program for deposits that are not as obviously valuable and as easily discernible and locatable as were the old Comstock Lodes or the other
15

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
outcroppings--even they were a little hard to come by in the beginning--and to recognize that we have low grade, wide-spread deposits where are large investments that must be made before there can be a discovery, and therefore there ought to be some pre- discovery protection for those that are willing to spend the money. This is basically exactly what we had in the uranium days. And yet at that time we did not have, and do not now have laws that provided for exploration permits. You find tw~ typ~s of attack that come up. One of them is that we should abolish all mining location systems because they are not in the best interests of the country and we should adopt a single competitive leasing system because that is, by definition of those propounding it, in the best interests of the country. I think that the uranium boom, if it didn't teach us anything else, taught us that the harnessing of the self-interest of the people by giving them the benefit of trying and succeeding, even at the risk of being the one that bore the burden of failing--that the harnessing of that self-interest of the American ingenuity and will to do is probably one of the most effective means for surmounting obstacles that might never be overcome if
you allowed it only to a planned society. Those who 16

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
would take away the benefits of looking and succeeding are to my mind, without intending to do so, leading us toward stagnation in the development of our resources in this country and of the
improvement and the change including the passing over some minerals that we think were great and going on to others. And I think we have to have that type of thing in order to succeed. The mining laws, as I said, I think were put in the position of requiring major revision to meet current conditions because the uranium boom came in the late 1940s and fifties. The choice deliberately made by the Atomic Energy Commission to use the mining law system instead of a leasing system, which was available to them und~r the laws as they existed, was a carefully thought out policy designed to get the maximum benefits for the country by encouraging people to go out and look and succeed, then let them take the benefits. I think that's being lost sight of at this time, and I think if nothing more that ought to be highlighted in the uranium period because it's the typical type of effort with the same basic results in every period of our history. If you want to go back and check more ancient history, you'11 find that even in Germany under the old baronial system that the barons with
17

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
their private property came to the conclusion that the one way to get mineral development, have it discovered and developed, was to allow individual people without permission to come on their property and look for the minerals; and if they found them, then the preference right to develop them. Of course, they also took the royalty out of it which we denied
in this country, but that's another situation. And-- well--I'm merely identifying a long history of things that is now culminating in proposals to make drastic changes. But without, at least the current proposals of the recent Public Land Law Review Commission did not do so, without denying the right of individuals to self-initiate a right. Because--
MB: Okay, we have dealt primarily with the historical focus of the mining law and how it came to the point where it is. It had several power thrusts along the way, areas which were extreme problems at the time which first had to be overcome, and then one mounting on each other formed, what you called this move to
have this mining law changed. Now for example, you mentioned the disputes whether claims should be placer or lode. And also the unpatented or patented mining claims. The hardness of getting a patent today is an example. How do the courts and the actual
18

 H . BYRON MOCK # 1
interpretations of the laws themselves come into play in the solving this problem of the eventual forming it to a head at least?
HM: Well, in the first period of this, the Atomic Energy Commission was in such complete control of the uranium development that they were basically able to negotiate if they wished to a preference lease on lands that were withdrawn from mining location. And they could basically negotiate with anyone they wanted to on a choose-' em and deal-' em basis. They also had the control of the market, and they also had the control of certain licensing powers without which a person discovering the uranium deposits was helpless to get his benefits. Because of all this, there really wasn't any question raised about the validity of mining claims. I have always known that there was a substantial question that could have been raised between individuals. I participated in the settlement of an area of problem over in Colorado, the so-called Bowl Canyon area. For years a group of us had tried to get the mining and the oil groups together so that a company that got an oil and gas lease over an area that had been for some time covered with mining claims could be drilled with some security of title in the driller. The mining
19

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
claimants had these dormant mining claims lying out there that had never been extinguished in the eyes of the law and which were subject to being renovated and resuscitated, if you will, and asserted as a valid right that would give to the mining claimants under certain conditions the rights apparent to the oil and gas lessee. The federal government issued these leases without any guarantee of title, except a buyer-beware deal, and they didn't worry about delivering a clear title, and they certainly gave no warranty. When we tried to get the mining group to work together in finding a solution to this with the oil and gas companies, we sort of got the back of the hand. They said, "Oh, we've got the claims. Let them worry." When we hit the Bowl Canyon area, however, the oil and gas people had gotten there first, and they had the oil and gas leases on the entire area that suddenly became one of the hottest prospects for mining claims for uranium in the country. And at that moment the mining boys started to scream to get some kind of adjustment worked out with the boys that held the oil and gas leases that made any location of a mining claim held over them invalid. The problem despite its amusing character was a very was a very serious one. I worked with the Atomic Energy
20

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
Commission boys to precipitate some kind of a lease proposal. As a matter of fact, I had suggested very definitely that regardless of who got the mining claim, I though that the Atomic Energy Commission ought to just automatically grant them a preference lease to the area and then let them worry about who legally owned--which was the proper route because regardless of where it came out, you wouldn't hold up production and that you wouldn't be penalizing the guy that in faith was trying to solve the intricacies of a very complicated legal situation. This was not entirely adopted. I must say that I came under a little bit of fire from the Atomic Energy Commission boys and Joint Atomic Energy Commissions in Washington and other places for even daring to raise the question. But having raised it, it had to be
faced, and I was trying to find a solution that would let people go forward rather than letting them go farther and let them fall off the edge of a cliff and to complete bankruptcy and fair to let someone else benefit from it. I wanted something that was sensible and usable. The Bowl Canyon thing really broke when the combination of oil and gas leases, mining claims--would-be mining claims--and the drilling of the area by the U.S. Geological Survey with the using
21

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
of Atomic Energy Commission money, but contracting private people to do the drilling--uh--caused government financed drilling to make some rather valuable discoveries. And this combination, and I'm not trying to extricate us from all parts of it, but this combination led to something that roughly resembled the Oklahoma Land Rush or the Alaskan Gold Rush, if you will, with people going out trying to locate new claims including some of the people that had done the contract drilling for the government who had made the discovery and had then turned their results over to the Atomic Energy Commission. The Atomic Energy Commission then applied to the Bureau of Land Management to have the lands withdrawn to be administered by them as known valuable uranium reserves. Those were not the exact words, but this was the thrust of it. In Colorado at that time you had three months to file your certificate of discovery of location. It was strange how many mining claims were filed. About two and a half months after the land had been withdrawn and the date recited on the location notices was two weeks or more prior to the actual withdrawal by the government. If they were
valid and if they were located at that time and if
there had been a discovery prior to the withdrawal
22
I

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
those claims were superior to the rights of the United States. Assuming that you accepted a uranium mining claim as a valid uranium mining claim. The-- and they were being accepted at that time. As a consequence of this, the Bureau of Land Management, which was in this area under my direction, was asked
to go in and check up on certain mining claims. We went in and simply said that the mining claims were not valid, and that at that moment the Atomic Energy boys got pretty upset with us because we were destroying their exploratory program. This was done, I must say, at the request and in the self-interest of the AEC boys in the field who were scared to death that they would yet be caught in the great give-away scandal and weren't about to. I had visitors from Washington and other places, but no one ever seemed to put anything in writing telling me to cease and desist on this type of investigation. So I just doubled it. I put another man on with Hahn so that they would be protected and we went forward with it.
MH: I have a question on an incident here just out of curiosity. There was quite a bit of notoriety over the Vernon Pick Mines, the Hidden Splendor and various others here where they said that the Atomic Energy people actually led him to the discovery. Like
23

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
the Atomic Energy people were actually mingling in certain mines, you know, and taking active part.
HM: Well, in fairness to all concerned, the Atomic Energy group was a very fine group, as most government employees are, who are concerned with helping those that are trying to do these things in the mining
field. Vernon Pick may have been on of the very remarkable accidents of our time and something in my opinion that is not to be condemned but to be envied. He had come--and I've heard this from him directly-- from running an electrical shop back someplace back in the lake states and had been burned out in a fire. He had insurance money to restart his operation, but he and his wife decided they would just buy a trailer and just head for Mexico. And they got as far as Colorado. Because of his familiarity with many of the devices and new devices used for the searching and looking for minerals that I assume his electrical
background helped him to understand better than most, he got interested in this. It may have been that he ran out of money by the time he got to Grand Junction. He's indicated that he was a little short at the time. And he like literally hundreds of others went to the Atomic Energy Commission and said, "We want to go out and explore. And where would be a good
24

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
place to look?" And I see nothing wrong with these people saying, "Well, here is an area that has good potential. Maybe you should go look there." Some people think that there was a lot more. That someone took them out and said put your claim here. I don't happen to believe that. I think they happened to have
indicated a certain area of interest that would be worth checking.
Was that in the Big Muddy River?
MH:
HM: Well, it could have been. I at one time was quite
familiar with the exact location of all these place, but I'm not now. But in any even, he went and look and he found. I think you had better take another look, though, at whether the Vernon Pick Mine was really as great a discovery as most people thought. It was a highly valuable mine. He sold it for ten million dollars plus other prerequisites including a research airplane and some other things. And the reports that I subsequently heard and have no reason to question, where that the mine didn't pan out as a ten-million-dollar mine. I think that it panned out for the company that acquired it which was the stock company, but I'm not so sure that it ever panned out on an actual production basis in the same way. In any event, I would have a little trouble identifying
25

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
where anybody got hurt in this process. And certainly the development of that particular deposit, whatever
it produced, was highly contributory to our national needs even if it were not as great as had been dreamed of. And secondly, the story of that windfall just opened the gates for every prospector in the country to come out and have his try. And quite a few of them succeeded. And maybe they would have come without it and maybe they wouldn't have. And if we needed uranium, and I have no doubt that we did, I think this harnessing of the self-interest in the initiative of individual people to get a job done is a very remarkable illustration of how well this democratic system can work if we will allow the people to get the benefit of their efforts. Now this leads us up to today very quickly. The criticism that comes of these people that do go out and mine and develop--and many of these are open pit--you take the uranium deposits of Wyoming, the Gas Hills and the Lucky Mack and some of the others, and down toward Baggs and some of the other big deposits that have been open-pitted. They were out in the most desolate part of the country you can find. I 've been there when the wind is whipping through, and goodness knows anyone in his right mind wouldn't have been there.
26

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
And the only use that has been made of that range and that country for a long time was the cattle grazing. And there is no reason why it couldn't basically continue, and it essentially did, although there were certainly some interruptions and certainly some
inconveniences. The question of the benefits to the country, I think if you measure in dollars it's beyond question which was of greater benefit. If you start looking at a rancher who also had a mining claim, it really didn't make a lot of different if he was disturbed. But there may have been a lot of ranchers that didn't have mining claims that were disturbed and they're still yelling. And I wish there was some way to avoid that, but I don't think the answer is to stop developments. The outcry over ruining the country really didn't begin to arise until quite a few years after the uranium boom had peaked out and the consolidation of large holdings had progressed substantially.
This is bringing in the large company aspect which is
MH:
something that I wonder about.
HM: Well, the large companies--I don't care whether it's
a consortium of a lot of small companies that have to have some common financing and common mission in order to most effectively operate, or whether it's
27

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
some major that has gotten a lot of capital and can afford to put in the amount of money that's necessary for these developments. It really doesn't make a lot of difference. If you could develop a uranium deposit by a one-man operation, I see no reason why it shouldn't be done, except that it takes an awful lot of one-man operations to match one big open-pit development. And the amount of money that is available is certainly a substantial question there. The little one-man operations are normally an underground mining deal. And they're poor-bayed along. They have their place incidentally. If it weren't for them, there are an awful lot of these deposits that couldn't be economically be justified by a major company. And therefore to cut out the small prospector and the small miner is to my mind a potential waste of rather valuable resources in the aggregate. Maybe individually they don't look so great. And I think to waste those small deposits by lack of development is a waste that this nation shouldn't risk. However, no one-man operation that ever came down the pike didn't want to be more than that. And if he can be more, well, God bless him! Let
him have at it. But we then get into this point of the impact another uses and other values. The
28

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
surface, the atmosphere, the water, the scenic, the nasal, the auditory, anything you want to bring in starts to be multiplied--not in an arithmetic progression, but in sort of a compounding thing. It's
squared rather than a direct. The bigger they are--if they are ten times as big, they may be a hundred times as offensive. Let's put it that way. And the controls of those then become necessary because of the damage to the values of our--well, simplified--of our environment that requires some action. Uranium isn't in that field at this stage. You're seeing the attitudes being directed more toward the fear that we might open up oil shale developments in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah. Or the denouncement of a mining operation that happens to be located in the vicinity of beautiful scenery that we would all love to see protected and developed. It could be in the White Clouds area of Idaho, it could be northwest area up, in the state of Washington, it could be up in Alaska. It could be in Utah in the Lake Powell area?
MH:
HM: It could be in Utah and it could be--we've had the
problem already, not of mining, but of trying to develop a few resort areas over near Flaming Gorge where the public lands have been withheld because they're afraid the fragility of the area will not
29

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
stand that many people. Well, these are all critical questions that must be faced.
MH: They now come into legal areas, right?
HM: When we get into the legal area, you're starting to
run into a new developing program that--it would be hard to identify exactly when it started--if we could. I can trace it back in some respects back to the ancient common law of England where they had ancient light's doctrine where they said if you had built your property in such a way that you were immediately adjacent to your neighbor's property, but you had maintained your access to the light and air from your structure for a certain periqd of years that your neighbor couldn't build, even though he's on his side of the property line, in such a way as to obstruct your light and air access. We hadn't reached that in the common law acceptance in this country. We didn't important that because I guess we didn't think we needed it. Now we're starting to worry about it as though it's a new problem. England faced that many years ago. The line of sight problems, the visual easements, the air space problems are all ones that you can find remnants of it back in England; you can find them in ancient Rome. Condominiums and things like that to give you space and air. And this type of
30

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
thing. Now what we have are two questions arising that are very--now let's take one at a time. We find people that are questioning whether or not the damage to their environment, whether they're talking as an
individual or as a representative of a class, is something that should be protected for them either by their government officials or by their own acts. We're getting a new concept of property which is rather interesting. It arises out of the things we're talking about. It's a third type of property right. We've always talked about the ancient property owner's right to center of the earth and to the sky above, the---?--- And gradually that got curtailed. And now we know the space rights above this land have been substantially preempted by the public uses or multiple individual uses for airplanes, for a line- of-sight radar tower, things, which are not quite as
secure a right incidentally. The space, above to get easements for power lines and things--there has been a curtailment of his exclusive right to get things above the ground. And then going below the ground, you run into the division into surface and subsurface rights, usually meaning surface and mineral rights. The difference between grazing and mineral rights?
MH:
HM: Well, it's the difference between the surface use,
31

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
which incidentally might be for mineral operations. You might have an open pit right on the surface where you have a valuable deposit, like the Dry Lakes of California and of other areas. If you divided between mineral and non-mineral uses, I think you have the real dichotomy. Once you start talking about minerals, though, because of our mining laws and our
leasing system and other concepts, we find that there is an increasing tendency to subdivide the mineral interest into locatable minerals or leasable minerals. And this isn't a true description, but it basically separates into what we're talking about. We find also in oil and gas and certain other types of extractive operations for minerals that there is a tendency to subdivide by horizons. You may subdivide your basement below the surface into a whole series of geologic structures, each of which we would call a horizon. And I have seen oil and gas leases which there might be five to ten different owners of mineral rights each segregated by a horizon or geologic structure. So that you have one on top of another. Now this is subdivision with a vengeance.
And we have the same thing above the ground so you have further subdivisions like that. Now the third element that's coming in here is the concern that you
32

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
or I or any other property owner or individual has with the use of adjacent property because of its
impact on us. The old English law of nuisance was one that took care of that type, or attempted to take care of that type of problem. If your neighbor does something that offends you visually, nasally, I guess because the slaughter houses were the original ones that caused us much problem, they weren't thinking as much in terms of scenery as we now do, but you have your scenic easement concepts that have come in now. And we are now starting á to get lawsuits by
individuals or by government that are demanding that a person not do something on his property that is unsightly to his neighbors. This is in Colorado where there's an open-pit slash on the side of the mountain over there near Colorado Springs which is offensive to many people that look across the valley and see that slash on the side of the mountain. It happens to be on private property, and these people acquired it in order to extract the stone from it. There are efforts to prohibit that type of scenic affront. There are other efforts which are much more tangible to limit--more effective--to limit the use of your property to create contaminated smoke. The smoke in and of itself may not be contaminated, and a safety
33

 H .
MH: HM:
BYRON MOCK # 1
threat, or a health threat, but it may be a visual affront.
Like Kennecott here?
Kennecott. Yeah. If you will check the area out here, you will find that the amount of particulate in that are offensive or endanger the safety or the health of people have been substantially reduced over the years, but the amount of smoke that's pouring out of there doesn't appear to be. And people are now thinking in terms of if you can see if it's harmful when really most of our damage may come from the things we can't see. But regardless of which it is, whether it's safety or whether it's health, or whether it's aesthetic, or whether in some case an economic destruction of your property because of-- well, take the freeway adjacent to it. These things may have a lot of different impacts. The question is coming, though, is there a recourse to an individual citizen to protect himself? We have the zoning laws and we have the other requirements and something they are the greatest offenders I might point out, to individual people. But does an individual person who is disturbed in his enjoyment of lands economically or emotionally--it doesn't make any difference--have any recourse in the courts to go in and protect him?
34

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
And this is that third part of the law that I'rn talking about: that in which every citizen has an
interest in his neighbor's property--the pure air, the pure water, the impact on them, the pure scenery, whatever it is. We are seeing lawsuits brought around the country in increasing numbers in which
individuals for themselves and for a class of people are bringing private suits to protect themselves against the misuse of another person's property by the owner--or their alleged misuse. As a result of this, there are a lot of people that are raising questions--and I happen to be one of them--not as to whether that is right or not, because I think it is, but whether we need a counterbalance in here that protects the property owner from the enthusiastic control of his property by all his neighbors to restrict him from doing anything they don't want him to do. Does he retain any rights that are needed to be protected in order to keep this balance that keeps us from going overboard into a certain of negative economic development type of approach. I don't care whether you're talking about the preservation of landmarks, or whether you're talking about the preservation of scenery, or whether you're talking about the elimination of pollution of air or water or
35

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
whatever it happens to be. I think we need to have two forces at work. One is the right of a citizen, an
individual to be protected by whatever course against the damage to him that comes by the use of somebody else's property by the owner. And secondly, I think we need to have a balance that protects a person who has property rights under our old traditional sense from having them completely destroyed because people want to go through an economic sacrifice of the values that he has to meet their wishes, whether valid or not. I'm not passing judgment on that. All I'm saying is that we need some kind of a counter- balancing force. The mining laws as much as anything else I know have represented this problem and are increasingly representing this problem. The first question that we probably have to answer and we get
into the second phase immediately is whether the public interest requires the additional development of resources. And you might have asked that question ten á years ago and people would have looked at you as through you were out of your mind because there was no question that we did require it for our public interest. Today you find an increasing number saying
we don't need that development. And--
MH: Both economically as we as aesthetically?
36

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
HM: And for the development of our resources. And it's
MH: HM:
MH: HM:
now becoming a line of argument that simply says that to allow the development is to cause pollution and environmental damage that would be prevented if we didn't do it.
Is this part of the marketability type aspect?
The marketability test is an entirely different problem.
Yeah.
Because it is an effort by administrative people to bridge that problem from the clearly valuable mineral into the potential valuable mineral. And to recognize that in the use of the word mineral deposits under the mining laws we have created a certain illogical monster because everything is certain respects has some mineral value.
But it's just establishing priorities.
And we have to come to the conclusion someplace as to
what is the cut-off point. Now marketability was originally talked about in connection with common varieties of deposits that might not have been traditionally called mineral. For example, in Alaska an old friend of mine many years ago by the name of Judge Fulta--I remember when he first went up there to practice law and then he was the first federal
MH: HM:
37

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
judge--handed down a very interesting decision that said you couldn't have a sand and gravel mining claim in Alaska because there is so much sand and gravel that it's not a locatable mineral; it has no value. And no one though of this as marketability. And his name was Judge Fulta.
MH: What decision was that, do you remember?
HM: I don't recall it. It was many many years ago and it has been submerged in the avalanche of other decisions many years since. But what he was saying in
effect was that if a thing is so common and so generally available that you can get it anywhere you want to turn, that you can no locate a mining claim for it because that essentially requires that you can develop a valuable mine. This is the exact language of the '72 law--develop a valuable mine. No, it's not the '72 law. It's the decisions, interpretations of it, because they talked about a valuable mineral deposit and then later on these things came in. Now if you could locate sand and gravel in the valley of Salt Lake City, you could locate everything in the countryside. The same thing was true down around Tucson where with the Minerals Reserve to the federal government and the surface sold off either under stock-raising homesteads or other laws where the
38

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
minerals did not pass. The lands that eventually come
into the hands of subdividers and developers who set up some of the beautiful residential areas for the people who like to live in the sun and paid the money for it. And then one day they woke up to find mining claims for sand and gravel staked across their front
lawns. In many ways this was probably a valid type of mining claim. But suddenly you came into a field which has been emerging with a greater rapidity over the recent years which is the question of comparable values--which is the higher value. Comparative value
I guess would be your term. And this in essence was the thrust of the Coleman decision decided out in California by the Supreme Court of the United States about three years ago. Two or three--
In '68.
HM: I think it was 1968. The Coleman decision was one
dealing with sand, building stone deposits and the law when people look at it is a very simple one. It says that lands are more valuable for building stone deposits may be located. More valuable. And the simplest of all decisions that could have been made in that case would have been to say that these lands are not more valuable for mineral deposit. This is the thrust of the final decision, but the words were
MR:
39

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
never mentioned. And it turned on the question of whether or not this particular deposit was marketable. Well, it actually was marketable because it has been sold. But the question was whether or not it was of a profit-making type of operation. And by the time they got into it, it wasn't. And, well, there are a lot of qualifications that can come on the Coleman decision. What I'm saying is that we're coming into a third phase of law which needed--which the marketability test is an overture for, and that is, a test for comparative values. And this starts to take in the use for surface development, for recreation, for scenic enjoyment, for anti-pollution, for environmental stability for any one of many things. These are all natural trends that arise out of the increasing pressures for nothing more complicated than just space.
MH: Now basically we've gone into areas of the mining law which you pointed out that some are weak, some area strong, but mostly that have adjusted. That in essence a law that was made in 1872 through both policy and administration and change has been able to survive. This leads to the question which I guess the Public Land Law Review Commission Report and other advocates of completely changing the mining law. rt
40

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
brings to mind the question, is the mining law today antiquated? Or is it no longer useful, say, for those aesthetic values or those non-foreseeable values which are coming today that nobody could foresee in
1872? Is there--how far do you think this change will
go?
HM: Well, the mining law has been a vehicle by which a
piece of property can be obtained from the federal government for development and profit and ownership by a citizen of the United States. The problem of how it shall be developed has been treated as something that mining laws alone can handle on the public lands. And this simply is not so. You have a piece of fee land that has been passed into private ownership in some other area of the country--Pennsylvania, for example, or here--and suddenly someone finds a highly valuable deposit on it. Let's say it's nothing more than sand and gravel right in the heart of Salt Lake City and someone wants to develop it. Can he do it? No. You have certain zoning restrictions and certain other protections that are put in there to stop this. We are beginning to get that type of control on lands regardless of whether they're federal ownership of whether they aren't. And you're getting sort of a negative zoning in many of the public lands by the
41

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
withdrawing of them from certain types of uses. Mineral development is one of those. The problem very quickly comes down to the conflict of various uses that are envisioned for a particular piece of land by
individual citizens or by people who represent some branch of government, whether it's local or national. And I think the key to our question here is the same problem that arises and is answered in the same way
it would be answered in relation to whether or not a particular person who has been dependent on a piece of the federal range to run a successful livestock operation should be denied that right just because someone without compensation--just because someone decides that now we want to put it to a different use. And it may be to his complete financial destruction in the property that he is dependent upon that he has bought and has developed in order to have a year round operation. There is no difference either in the question when you get down to that person who out of love for the outdoors and with a little vision has gone out and has acquired from the National Forest Service a piece of land that he and his family before him, and maybe he's a first generation--I happen to know of many third and fourth generation cabins--that are on the national forest in beautiful
42

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
areas, developed because of--not for profit, because of love for the out of doors and an opportunity to do it. Whether those people can suddenly be divested of their right to continue to use something that they have constructed that is of value because of a changing demand, or of an increasing demand by other people just 1ike them who we'11 cal1 the general public. What I think is the key question in all of these and many others is what device do we have to check the infallibility of the decision of the person who manages the land to deny a particular use? I don't question his right to deny it. I don't question that. I do question his right to be treated as absolutely infallible as the sold arbiter as to what
is best in the public interest-- [END OF S I D E ONE OF T A P E ]
HM: --in a particular location, area, region or nation. I think it needs checking. And this is what we are seeing today in the litigation that is going on in the courts in which the very find organizations of the Sierra Club, of the Wilderness Society, or whatever it might be, and it could be the American National Manufacturers Association, or the American Mining Congress, or the National Forestry Association or any other--in different context but with the same
43

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
general objective of making sure that the public interest in the use of lands is best served by the decisions that are made. We find these organizations coming in and standing in court to sue whether or not the Mineral King Ski Resort should be allowed to be developed. And the question I have is, does the public interest require that there be a standing for
other groups to come in and sue as to whether or not the public interest requires that it be developed. This is all I'm talking about. How can we get some meaningful review of what is the public interest instead of allowing it to be self-arrogated to a government official or a private organization or a private citizen? What meaningful review can we have on the discretionary action? And I've come to a very, very simplest of all decisions, and that is to recognize that there is a property interest, an economic interest that can not be denied without compensation. Then I think you have the proper brake and the proper cushion to allow change but not destruction of individual people and those interests. And I'm not doing this because of a worship of free enterprise system and all these other things that I
happen to think have more advantages than disadvantages; I'm talking about it simply as the
44

 H. BYRON MOCK #1
workable system that gives fair and equitable treatment to individual people and therefore to all people rather than denying the property interest in
the guise of the greatest good for the greatest number, and to hell with happens to the individual who is completely destroyed. This is all I'm talking about, and I think it's a system that is emerging and will hopefully be increasingly established. It does no damage to out concern for our environmental development. It does no damage to our concern for economic development, or new industry development. It does no damage to our need to restrict them. It
simply find a meaningful way in which you do not have the right to destroy my aspirations and my interests because you happen to be right about what is the public interest and do it at my sold expense.
Now, what I said is that all of these eventually get around to the question as to how can we have the most meaningful check on the discretionary action of those that represent the "public interest" to be sure, in effect, that they are truly representing? And we're seeing it emerge now in the question of the decisions that deal with ecology and the environment. And I
It's like a common economic protection?
MH:
HM: All it is is getting down to basic units of concern.
45

 H .
BYRON MOCK # 1
think that they are healthy, and I think that we must use them as a pattern for the development for the protection of other equally essential balancing values that are part of our national structure, and in, well, our human association structure wherever you find it. That seems a little vague, but it's an effort to point out what I would consider to be the fundamental building block without which we can never do more than generalize and by so doing always destroy the 49 percent. Now how it work$, how it can work is going to depend on who gets control defining what is the principal interest and what is a protectable property interest? It is not limited to economics. It can be emotional as well as anything else. The dependency on these matters can be as great as the á opportunities.
MH: So then in the end in comes down to something you mentioned before--space, and the protection of space? HM: We are getting into a conflict of demands for nothing more than just the common space. And if you want to
open that up--
MH: Malthusian theory?
HM: And if you want to open that up you're starting to
open up that question as to whether the right of privacy is still a property right.
46

 H . BYRON MOCK # 1
MH: You come down almost to the Malthusian theory versus
law?
HM: You get into it. I think the law is keeping pace with these things. And my concern is that in keeping pace with them, we don't destroy many things of value that are more important than the so-called goals that we are after; namely, human beings, to their individual rights, to the privacy, to a property, to opportunity, to security, to all these other matters. It's that simple. I wish it were less simple because it would be so much easier to discuss.
MH: So close and yet so far? Well, thank you. HM: Well, I don't know what you got out of that.
