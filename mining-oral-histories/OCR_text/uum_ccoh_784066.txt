MW: Were they still Buddhist?
RB: Yes, at least she was.
MW: Do you have any brothers or sisters? RB: I got two brothers.
MW: Okay, could you tell us their names? RB: Eushiro(?) and Share .
1

 MW: Why did your parents immigrate?
RB: I really don't know. I think like everybody else it
MW: RB:
MW: RB:
MW: RB: MW: RB: MW: RB:
MW:
was a new country, you know, better opportunities. When did they immigrate?
Roughly my dad came over in about somewhere in the 1919 or somewhere thereabouts then he went back and came with Mom about 1921.
How did he get his money to come over?
I don't know, I really don't. I think he borrowed it
myself to come over. If I remember right that's the way it went, he borrowed his money to come over.
Do you remember who he got it from?
I don't.
Ah, okay. Do you know which port he came into? Seattle.
Okay. How come he came to Carbon County?
I think he knew the people here that immigrated before him and they settled in Carbon County and I think he just followed them here, you know he knew they were here.
Have your parents ever told you some of the experiences they had coming over to the United States and once they got here?
Do you mean like on the ship?
Y e s .
RB:
MW :
RB: I know my mom was sick all the way over and she
2

 MW: NC: RB: NC:
RB: MW:
RB:
NC:
didn't know any English; she didn't know the English language. The only thing she knew, I believe, was banana and she said all the time she's been over she eat bananas all the way over because that's all she knew of the language. She probably got sick to her stomach with bananas but she was seasick all the time they came over and I guess when she was over here it was particulary rough especially during the Depression, I guess that was rough for everybody huh? Did they have any--what kind of---
Your dad worked in the coal mines right?
Hiawatha and Mohrland.
Oh, okay, was he ever involved in anything 1ike a strike?
Well, I don't ever remember him being on a strike.
I think they brought the Orientals in mainly as strike breakers.
It could have been, I don't know. Like I say I don't ever remember him being on strike or I don't ever remember the mines being on strike while he was working in the mines.
Did he say anything about the working condi tions i n the mine?
RB: Like what?
MW: Oh, how it was constructed and how hard he had to
work to get so much money and all t his , you know. 3

 RB: Well, when he was working, I think a lot of them were selling piece work where they got paid for the amount of work he done but he wasn't in that type of work where they was loading cars you know, they use to load cars and get paid so much per car they loaded and everything but he wasn't doing that kind of work. So as far as that goes that was a lot but they weren't getting many days, a lot of times they would only work maybe two or three days a month and it was
rough that way.
MW: What type of work in the mines did he do?
RB: He used to be a track layer.
MW: Oh.
NC: How much did you get paid for laying track?
RB: Well, what the going wages was, I don't know what it
was then, I have no idea. I know they weren't getting what they're getting now. I remember oh, way back there like I say you know when he would work two or three days a month, his paycheck would be $1.00. They would have to give him a dollar even if they didn't make that much, they would have to give them a dollar.
MW: Can you remember any difficulties he had while he was working like you know how some people are prejudiced?
RB: I don't ever remember anything like that really. MW: Were there many more Orientals up in Hiawatha?
4

 RB: When we went to Hiawatha there were quite a few bachelors up there, they had a boardinghouse over there and a lot of bachelors and it was about oh, I don't know, three or four families in Hiawatha at the
MW: RB: MW: RB: NC: RB: NC: RB: NC:
RB:
MW: RB: MW: RB:
time. In Mohrland there was a boardinghouse with a bunch of bachelors and I think there was about three or four families in Mohrland too but that's about the extent of it.
Can you remember the names of the boardinghouses? They didn't have a name?
Can you remember the people that ran it?
No, I was just a little kid at the time. (Chuckle) What did you do in your spare time?
Who?
You.
What did I do in my spare time?
Yes, when you were small and young and didn't have anything to do, what did you do?
Oh, I used to go climbing up in the mountains, I used to hike in the mountains all the time, especially in the summertime.
When your dad was off work what did he do?
Nothing. There was nothing to do.
I mean hobbies .
No, he didn't have any, just his garden and that's all.
5

 MW: As a family what kind of recreation did you do? RB: Do you mean with the family?
MW: Uh h u h .
RB: The family together.
MW: Yes.
MRB: Fight.
RB: Yes. (Chuckle) No, oh, when I was little we used to
always go up for picnics up the canyon and that's about the extent of what we did. This other stuff that we used to do by ourselves you know, hike and so on.
MW: Did you ever get together with some of the other families and have a celebration, a party, or something?
RB: Well, now on holidays and stuff like that like I say when we used to go on picnics then a lot of the families would get together and go up the canyon and get together like that like on New Years Day, you know that was one of their, that was the main holiday actually and that's when they really celebrated.
MW: How did they celebrate it?
RB: Over here?
MW: No, then, yes over in the United States.
RB: Do you mean in the states here?
MW: Uh huh.
RB: Well, I can remember we used to spend two or three
6

 MW: RB:
MW: RB:
MW: RB: MW: RB:
MW:
RB:
MW: RB:
days before a New Year fixing all this food and stuff here. Then they would have their food put out on the tables in their homes. Then everybody would go to everybody else's house, you know, make the rounds and everything. They would eat and drink and booze it up and that's the way they used to celebrate it over here .
What kind of foods did they have?
Well, they had this stuff, they rolled up rice, what do they call those?
Egg rolls.
Yes and they had fish, great big fish and little
shrimp. I know we always use to have lobsters, big old lobster in a shell and everything and a lot of that foreign food.
What kind of desserts did you have?
You mean on New Years or anytime?
Anytime.
Gosh, I don't remember them feeding dessert unless it was ice cream or cake.
You said that you have drink, did you make your own wine or whatever.
The saki, yes, that's rice wine, they use to make it
themselves , oh, potent.
Do you know how they made it?
We used to get a great big, earthenware jar I think,
7

 NC: RB: NC: RB:
NC: RB:
NC: RB:
NC:
RB: NC:
then they would put rice in it and that rice would ferment you know with the water and everything else. Somehow or another--they had a wooden box or something and they would put it in there and then the saki would drain off the water to a little glass container or something. I can remember that because my brother use to go over there and take a sip every once in a while and he used to get boozed while they were brewing that stuff. I don't know what they use to put in it besides rice and water really.
What kind of games did you play when you were little? Me?
Uh huh.
(Chuckling) You probably don't even remember these games, kick the can.
Yes, we do. (Chuckle)
Spin the bottle. (Laughter) Hide and go seek, boy this is way before your time.
Little kids just don't play 'em anymore.
We use to play the regular basketball, football, baseball, and stuff like that.
Can you remember any other experiences that sort of stick out from your childhood, you know what I mean? What kind of experiences were you looking for?
Like my grandmother, she tells me of the practical
jokes she's played and things like that. 8

 RB: I don't know. I don't have anything that really comes to my mind when I was really small. As I grew older I can remember booze parties but that's the only thing that sticks out in my mind .
MW: What was it like living in Utah in the Depression, where were you living during the Depression, here?
RB: Ah, during the Depression that was about 1926, '27, '28 or something like that. I was just barely born in '26.
MW: About where were you living?
RB: Well, we lived in Mohrland right after I was born, so
I imagine I was living in Mohrland at the time from '26 on.
MW: What kind of hardships do you remember that happened during the Depression?
RB: I don't remember, I just know how my morn used to talk.
MW: Okay, what did she say?
RB: Well, like I say you know, they told me that they
only used to work maybe two or three days a month and my morn always used to tell me that she didn't even have ten cents to buy a quart of milk , that 's what the local store wanted at the time, ten cents a quart, and she didn't even have a dime to buy milk. I know Christmas' were skimpy.
MW: How did you celebrate your Christmas? 9

 RB: I didn't celebrate, boy it was rough. We used to always have a tree because we'd go up in the mountains to cut a little tree but that is about the extent of it.
MW: When did you start your education; how old were you when you first started going to school?
RB: Six.
MW: Did you go all the way, like we're going now did you
go through high school or did you continue after you
got out of high school?
RB: No, I just went to high school that's it.
MW: Okay, what was your first job?
RB: I was working in this cinder block plant. No, that
was my second job; my first job I had I was cleaning
railroad cars.
MW: Where was this at?
RB: Up in Hiawatha.
MW: How old were you?
RB: I think I just turned eighteen.
MW: How much did you get paid for it?
RB: A dollar a car.
MW: About how many cars did you do a day?
RB: Ah, we used to clean cars five days a week. I think
it was, I think in three days we'd clean about thirty to thirty-five cars and in two days we cleaned between fifty and sixty cars .
10

 MW: What kind of entertainment did you have, like my grandmother she said there was an amusement hall.
RB: Yes, there were amusement halls, that's where you would go down and play your basketball, they would have their movies in the amusement hall. They used to have, oh, what did they call it? We use to call it an confectionery in the basement where you would go down
there, just like in the drug store, you would go and get your malts and candy and that stuff. I guess you would call it a malt shop now, but they used to call it confectioneries then.
MW: Did you have dances very often?
RB: When I was going to junior high and high school they
used to have dances up at Hiawatha quite often you
know.
MW: Was there a particular reason for the dances or did
they just hold them every so often?
RB: Oh, once a while it would be on holidays and once in
a while they would just have one you know.
MW: This is just curiosity, you know that the Orientals
had the long pigtails?
RB: Yes, the Chinese.
MW: I'm curious, how come we see these shows and if they
get their pigtail cut off they get very, very upset,
how come? (Laughter)
RB: You know, I used to wonder that too and then I heard
11

 MW:
RB:
MW: RB:
MW: RB: MW: RB: MW:
RB: MW: RB:
MW: RB:
an explanation one time and I'11 be darn if I can remember it now. There was something about cutting their pigtails and I can't remember what it is because I used to wonder t hat.
What other kind of entertainment, was there any music that you particularly liked , that you and your parents liked?
I don't know what kind of music my mom and dad liked, you're asking me about when I was a kid now?
Yes.
Well, okay. Golly, I don't remember what kind of music they used to have, I really don't.
Did you play an instrument or anything like that?
Who?
Your father or mother play any instrument?
No.
Can you remember any of the songs your mother might have sung to you when you were little.
No.
Can you remember any of the [Tape Problems]
They had one that was painted on a canvas that was a picture of Mt. Fiji and that's the only one I can remember.
[END OF S I D E ONE]
How old were you when World War II started?
About seventeen I believe . 12

 MW: Okay, can you remember any difficulties they had against the Orientals during this time?
RB : MW: RB:
NC: RB:
NC: RB:
MW: RB:
MW:
RB:
Me personally?
You or your parents or the Orientals in the canyon. Oh, I know they took my radio and my camera away from me, I remember that.
Why?
They thought I was going to take pictures you know, my radio had shortwave, they figured I'd pick up stuff from over in Japan you know. They did, they took my radio and my camera away, I remember that.
Can you remember anything else?
No. Actually, I was born here in Carbon County and I grew up with all these kids you know, gosh, we just grew up together and I didn't have any trouble with
them. The only troubles I had was with people who came here from somewhere else, you know.
What did they do?
Well, you know how people are, they're prejudiced. But people that I grew up with, I never had any trouble with them.
What was your parents view towards the Second World War? I mean, did they hold anything against the United States because they were fighting their country or anything like that .
Oh no, or at least they never said anything to me 13

 about it or they didn't show anything.
MW: Did you ever get your camera and radio back?
RB: I never got my camera back. I got my radio back
because I took the short wave out of it. MW: How c o m e ?
RB: Well, they took up these, they sent the cameras to Salt Lake and I lost the receipt so I never did claim it.
MW: Oh, that's mean.
RB: My daddy, built a--
MRB: Outside .
RB: Outside, yes, outside of the house he built this old
room and it had a great big old bathtub in it and it was made out of galvanize and reinforced with wood. Then he would build a fire underneath it to heat the water and it was regular old, oh, it was kind of bath house that they had back in Japan. You jump in it, you soak in it and you jump out and you wash and rinse yourself off and you jump back in and soak in it, you never wash in it, all you do is soak in it. You were right up to your neck in it.
MW: That's cold.
NC: Why can't you wash it, why can't you wash it.
RB: Because you'd have to change the water every time.
NC: Oh.
RB: See, this way they can keep the water in there for
14

 about a week you know because all you do is go in the
water and soak in it.
NC: Did it heat all this time, all this time would it be
heating, the fi re i n there?
RB: Oh no, you just build a fire whenever you want to
take a bath. You would build a fire under there and
you would get the water hot.
NC: Was it ever too hot?
RB: Oh yes, when it got too hot then you would have to
pour cold water in it.
MW: Did your mother make her own soap?
RB: Not that I remember.
MRB: She didn't use soap, a lot of people don't.
RB: Ma. (Laughter)
MRB: You said you jumped in out of the bathtub.
RB: Then you would wash outside, outside the tub and then
you would rinse yourself off.
MRB: Rinse yourself off how, did you get water to splash
on you and then climb back in the bathtub?
RB: Yes, and then soak in it.
MRB: Where did the water go, did you just dip it on the
ground?
RB: There use to be a drain. Oh yes, you should have seen
the way they had to be made. NC: Not thanks.
RB: We had a potbellied stove in there so in the 15

 wintertime you wouldn't get cold in there, they had a place for you to get undressed and dressed. Yes, it was real neat. Mother you take a bath in one of those and you wouldn't take a bath in one of these here other tubs.
MW: Were there community bath houses?
RB: No, each family had their own if they wanted but then
where the boardinghouse was you know, they had their regular bath house where the people in the boarding house worked .
MW: Could you give me some names of people to talk to? RB: Around here?
MW: Uh huh.
MRB: ---?--- would be hard to understand.
MW: That's all right, we'll record it and then we'll figure it out later.
MRB: If you were Japanese all you'd have to do is write it down.
MW: I thought we'd ask him. What's his name?
RB: Willie Capner, I don't know whether she's from over
there or if she's from over here.
MRB: Do they have to be?
MW: Well, it's Carbon County.
MRB: Yes, but she wasn't born over in Japan.
RB : I don't know whether she was or not .
MW: That's all right just as long as l i ves in Carbon
16

 County and can tell us about Carbon County and what
she did.
RB: I don't know where she lives. She lives somewhere
outside of here, I think she lives in the ---?---
doesn't she?
MW: Will you speak a thing in Japanese for us please. RB: Kuno(?).
MW: Oh, come on. (Laughter)
RB: Nagicka(?).
MW: Okay, what does it mean?
RB: What time is it.
MW: Okay, when were you born?
RB: When? June 24, 1926.
MW: Where?
RB: West Hiawatha.
MW: Okay. The reason for the last two question is because
there is too much static at the first to hear or understand him. This interview is with Mr. Ralph Budo and the interview is at his home in Price, Utah and this interview is for the Multi Cultural Study Program and the Date is January 12, 1973.
