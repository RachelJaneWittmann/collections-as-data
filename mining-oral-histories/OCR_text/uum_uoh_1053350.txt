 THE FOLLOWING IS AN INTERVIEW WI TH JOSEPH E. HOPKINS, JR., CHIEF MINING ENGINEER, MINING AND METALS DIVISION, UNION CARBIDE CORPORATION, GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO, ON JULY 23, 1970 IN MR. HOPKIN'S OFFICE. THE INTERVIEWER IS CLARE E N G L E . [ T H I S I S P A R T O F T H E U T A H U R A N I U M OR A L H I S T O R Y PROJECT. TAPE #1.]
CE: Thank you, Mr. Hopkins, for taking time to talk with me this morning. I am very interested in the contribution you have made to this company since you have been here a very long time. Union Carbide, oF course, has made a large contribution to the uranium
industry. But before we talk about what you do specifically, will you tell me where you were born and where you were raised and educated?
JH: Well, I'd be very glad to, Miss Engle. I was born in Breckenridge, Colorado, right up here in the mountains and lived there for the first thirteen years of my life. My father was in gold dredging and the family moved to Alaska in 1928. He was in charge of all gold dredging in Alaska for the United States Smelting and Refining Company. They started out with about two dredges and ended up with about eight. I
was in Alaska and out of Alaska going to school in the states. I went to school in Chicago, outside of Chicago on the north shore at Lake Forest Academy. Then I went to the Colorado School of Mines for a couple of years. Then I went back to Fairbanks one summer and worked and saw that I could finish school

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
there, so I finished at the University of Alaska in 1939.
CE: Where is that?
JH: That's at Fairbanks.
CE: Oh, at Fairbanks.
JH: Yeah, about four miles out of Fairbanks.
CE: What do you remember about Alaska during the '30s? JH: During the '30s, let's see, I remember that it was--
the town of Fairbanks was about 1,500 population, and you knew everyone in town. There was a lot of mining activity going on. During the summers most of the people were out in the hills working, I mean most of the men.
CE: Gold mining?
JH: Yeah, gold mining of different kinds.
CE: Just gold mining, was there any other kind of mining? JH: Well, there was some platinum in Good News Bay,
that's some distance from Fairbanks. And then there is some tungsten about 30 miles from Fairbanks. But
mostly it was gold.
CE: What did you do after you graduated from--
JH: Oh, after I graduated from the school in Fairbanks I
went to Nome and worked over there. In fact I worked over there for a couple of summers. In 193, my present wife came over and we were married in Nome.

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
CE: Where did you live and what were you doing?
JH: I worked for U.S. Smelting as an engineer on a gold
dredging operation. Then-- (clears throat) --it seems
like I am a little hoarse. Then during--
CE: Maybe you got some of that mining dust too.
JH: Maybe. I worked there as an engineer dredging from
1 39 to '42. In 1942--of course the war broke out in 41, I guess it was, and gold mining was pretty much curtailed. We could see that it was going to have to shut down because the cost of operation was so much greater than any profit that was being made. So I started looking around for jobs other places and wrote three letters to the U.S. Vanadium Corporation, which is [now] this company. I wrote to Red Lodge, Montana, Rifle, Colorado, and Grand Junction. The man in Rifle forwarded my letter to the general manager in Grand Junction and recommended that they hire me for Rifle. So I came to Grand Junction on June 1, 1942, arrived here at 8 o'clock in the morning on the train, went down to a little warehouse, which was the other office on Seventh Street, and met Mr. Brewell, who was the manager. He introduced me to John Hill who was in charge of the mining. John said that he
would start me on my vanadium and uranium education. I think mostly it was vanadium then, they didn't know
3

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
much about uranium. So we got in the pick-up and drove back the direction I had come, to Utah, and went into Hanksville, Utah. We went up to one of the mines. The Ecker Brothers, you may have heard of them, they were mining vanadium. We stopped at the
CE: JH:
CE: JH:
CE:
farmhouse. I can remember John asked one of the farm boys where his dad was. He said, "Pa, oh Pa, he's up at the mine a minin'." So we drove on up to the mine, and there was "Pa" on his back under a little shelf of rimrock, and he had a pick and a box and he was chipping out the high grade vanadium at that time. Carnotite?
Yeah, carnotite ore. Then we went on from there around through Dove Creek and into Uravan, and I was signed up in Uravan, that's where they did all the hiring. So I was on the payroll at that point.
Now that's in 1942?
Yeah, that's in 1942, June. Do you want to continue on this trend?
Yes, I do. I was just wondering what was going on at
Uravan in 1942?
JH: Well, they had a mill going and there was a great
deal of activity, a lot of mining, and the vanadium mill was going very strongly. This vanadium mill was operating. They didn't know about uranium, although
4

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
Madame curie had found some radium and uranium there earlier. But they weren't making any effort to save the uranium, and it was all being stockpiled in the
tailings. About this time, or a little bit later, there were about 250,000 tons of tailings in the river that contained 25 hundredths of one percent uranium. But anyway to go back a minute, we went into Uravan and got all signed up, and then I came back to Grand Junction and started work as mine examination engineer. Then I left.
CE: What did you do as a mine examination engineer?
JH: You go around and look at mines and try to find out if there is any potential, try to estimate the ore reserves that could be (there]. Then we would also give the miner some incentive to go ahead and follow
the ore if there were any indications of the ore. Then after I did a lot of mine examination work I was transferred over to Dove Creek, Colorado, as engineer in charge of the ore receiving and stockpile for Metals Reserve, which was also a division of Union Carbide. We would buy ore from the miners. It was all purchased ore, vanadium content, and bring it into the mill and crush it. We had our own crushing plant set-up. We did our own maintenance, we had a very small crew, there were only two or three of us. We
5

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
would stockpile this ore, and then pick it up with
loaders and ship it into Durango; there was a mill operating in Durango all the time. This went on for several months.
CE: The Metals Reserve period lasted for about two years, didn't it?
JH: Yeah, the Metals Reserve did, but this actual stock- piling that I was connected with didn't last the full time. I was--oh, another thing that we did to add incentive to the miners [wasJ we would go out and sell them powder at cost and collect their drill steel. We bought an Ingersol-Rand bit sharpener and set it up in the office area where we were, and then we would sharpen their steel for them for nothing and try to stimulate production of vanadium. I worked for John Hill on this, and we got along real well and bought a lot of ore. He was in Grand Junction and I was in Dove Creek.
CE: What was his job then?
JH: I think it was called Supervising Engineer or some
such thing. Or Superintendent, he was over quite an area. Then I thought that if I could ever get into a uranium or a vanadium mill that this would be the answer, I just couldn't wait. They looked so big and so active and I just wondered what all the secrets
6

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
were that were hidden in that mill. So I'd go down to Uravan and visit from time to time and see what was going on. I might say that they had a mill at North
Continent Mines, which was at the foot of Slick Rock Hill about 25 or 30 miles from Dove Creek. We would buy ore from the North Continent Mines and we got one check for ore shipments that was a $25,000 check, and rather than mail that on down to them, I took it down personally to give it to them and I met the superintendent, Slim Lundquist. Actually his initials were A. Q. Lundquist. He was running North Continent Mines. He had just come in from Montrose in an airplane and had lodged one wheel in a gopher hole. The plane was up on its prop and he was trying to dig it out, so I helped him. That was the beginning of a lifelong friendship. Slim and I worked a lot together
in the years to follow.
CE: He was general manager here in the '30s, wasn't he? JH: Yeah, he was general manager and then vice president.
I don't think it was in the '30s, it was in the '40s and '50s, yeah. But he would be a good man for you to see in Denver if you had the opportunity.
CE: We have someone going there this weekend; I have his name from Mr. Emerson.
JH: W ell, good.
7

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
CE: Thank you.
JH: He would really be a good man to contact. So I went
down to Uravan finally; I was transferred down there
and was breaking in on the milling processes.
CE: Learning vanadium now?
JH: Yeah, learning vanadium. I thought this was the only
thing. After a short time there was an army contract plant b u ilt about 1943. Anyway, i t was b u ilt primarily to handle the tailings that had collected, these 250,000 tons of tailings.
CE: Did you know why they were interested in the tailings?
JH: No. Nobody knew anything about why they were interested, and it was built by the Manhattan D istrict. The Manhattan D istrict engineers had an office set up here in Grand Junction. For every
accountant they had an accountant, and for every property man they had a property man. It was just a duplicate. There was a large room upstairs above the Gambell's store and the room had a partition down the middle with glass windows in it. The army was on one side and U.S. Vanadium was on the other side. It was just man for man practically. Slim Lundquist was in charge of the company side. Anyway, they built this
mill, and I was put in as superintendent to start it. 8

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
We ran the mill for a short time. At the same time there was another mill being built in Durango,
Colorado, by the army engineers for the recovery of uranium from those tailings. After this mill was going I was transferred to Durango.
CE: How long were you in Uravan then?
JH: I think until about late in '43 or early in '44.
CE: Just about a year the first time?
JH: Well, it wouldn't be over a year, probably within a
year.
CE: What was it like during this time? What was Uravan
like? How big was it?
JH: Oh, Uravan probably had--oh, I'm just guessing now,
but 800 to 1,000 people.
CE: Was that the capacity? Is that the largest group of
people that has ever lived there?
JH: No, I think there were more people [that] lived there
later on in the '50s.
CE: In the boom years?
JH: Yeah, there were a lot more transient people in
there. During this time they lived in cabins, and there were some tents up the river. There used to be a tent town, but this was gone pretty well.
CE: For miners?
JH: Yeah. For anybody; families would live in these
9

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
tents. There were a few families still remaining in tents, they didn't get along too well. Finally they all moved into cabins when they were there.
Was this right in Uravan or was this up along the mines, where the tent town was located?
Well, the tent town was probably up the river about
CE:
JH:
CE: JH:
CE: JH:
3/4 of a mile from Uravan, it was considered a part of Uravan really.
Did you have a family at that time? Were you married? Yes, I was married, I brought my wife and daughter from Fairbanks, and then we had a son in Grand Junction, and later on another daughter.
So your family lived in Uravan with you.
Right. Then we went to Durango, but we were only in Durango long enough to get the plant going real well. Mr. Brewell came down and offered me a job in Bishop, California, with the company to operate a calcium- molybdate operation. So I want out to Bishop and that was not an economical arrangement, so I came back to Colorado and went to work again for Mr. Lundquist. At
this time I was in charge of the receiving of materials, such as soda ash and acid and all of this thing. Over at the A. E. C. compound, at that time there wasn't any A.E.C. and we were in that area, and it was a very small office, and we would receive all
10

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
of this stuff. Then we set up an iron box; there was residue from iron boxes at the mills that contained vanadium, it would precipitate on these iron filings, and we would collect that and ship it in and package
CE:
JH:
CE:
JH:
CE: JH:
it and sell it. This was one of our products.
At what period now is this? When you came back from Bishop?
This is when we came back from Bishop, and a little time has elapsed here, I guess this was '45.
Still before the McMann Act, but was it time enough
for you to know that we had an atomic bomb and that uranium was the force?
Oh yeah, I should go back and say that--let's see, when was the first atomic bomb dropped, in 1945? July.
July of '45. Well, at this time the major in charge of the army contract account called us of all into the office, but see, I was also in charge of property after this, bulk material; I was in charge of any item that cost $100 or more in the mills at Uravan and Durango. We had quite an elaborate set-up keeping track of all of this, and the army had a duplicate
set-up, like I said before. But-- CE: Why would they do that?
JH: Well, we had to be accountable for everything. 11

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
CE: No, I mean why would the army have a duplicate set-
up?
JH: Oh, I guess they just wanted to check on us and make
sure that we were loyal. That's the way-- CE: Man for man.
JH: Yeah, man for man, almost to the person. But anyway, the major called us all in one day to the army engineer's large office, and we sat around the floor on the perimeter of the building, you know, everyone had a place to sit. He said he just wanted to call us all together to tell us that it had been dropped. Well, 90% of us didn't know what had been dropped, and this was the bomb that had been dropped on Hiroshima. So then we knew what we had been doing, but up to this time nobody had any idea that the uranium that we had been getting was being used for the bomb.
CE: And you weren't familiar with what your Oak Ridge facilities were doing or the Lindy Air Products or Electromat, all of which were involved, one way or
another, weren't they?
JH: No. Right, nobody ever elaborated on it at all.
CE: And nobody dared question?
JH: No. It was very secret. It was a good thing that it
was, because it worked out very well to our 12

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1 satisfaction, didn't it?
CE: It ended the war, if that's what you mean.
JH: Yeah, that's right.
CE: How did you feel after you realized that you were
really very actively a part of the development of a
weapon such as this?
JH: Well, it gave you a feeling of confidence, I guess
you would say, as though you had done a part. I got that certificate on the wall for it, and I got a little silver button from Stimpson with an A on it, everybody did. Showing the "A" bomb, it's a little button that you wear. Now let's see--
CE: What did you say when he said, "Well, it's been dropped"? Do you remember? Do you recall how you felt?
JH: Everybody just wondered what had been dropped. Then they got to discussing it and they had heard of Hiroshima, or I guess they hadn't really heard it on the news yet. It came out on the news shortly after that. Oh, you felt pretty good, I guess you would say.
CE: How did this major present it? I'm trying to understand how someone in the military would react to news such as this, and how you--
JH: He had gotten word from the Pentagon, I guess. He 13

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
just mentioned it had been dropped, as if we all knew what had been dropped, but nobody did.
CE: He must have known something about it before, I mean-
JH: He must have, yeah. Some of the people in our company had, but nobody ever revealed anything, which I thought was pretty good to hold that secret. Then we went to Rifle after we left Grand Junction in about 1945. They were going to break up the army contract account. First we dismantled the plants at Uravan and
Durango.
CE: You didn't decide that you needed to continue to
produce uranium?
JH: No. You see these plants were built primarily for
those 250,000 tons of tailings, and when they were done and used up, not right at the time the bomb was dropped, but shortly after, they were all gone. Then all the plants were dismantled and all the equipment accounted for, and the army gave the U.S. Vanadium a clean bill of health. At that time I went to Rifle as plant engineer and was in Rifle until 1948. This was in '46 I think that I went to Rifle, 146, 147 and 1 48.
CE: What did you do there?
JH: Plant engineer at the U.S. Vanadium Mill.
14

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
CE: What does a plant engineer do?
JH: Oh, a plant engineer goes around and helps schedule
the maintenance and designs little things that need to be taken care of like chutes or bins or buildings or whatever might need to be done.
CE: Modernizing it to keep it up to date.
JH: Modernizing and helping the maintenance and ordering
materials, just helping keep the thing going. Then-- see, Uravan was idle as a main mill, it had been idled about 1944 I guess.
CE: What happened to the people then?
JH: They all were transferred and gone, I don't know
really where they all did go. A lot of the old- timers went to Bishop. Boy, there was an operation started in Henderson, Nevada, by the company, and they transferred several of the people out to Henderson. Then it didn't materialize too well. Oh, it lasted a couple of years. I was going to say this plant was idle since 1944, but the uranium end of it was going for the government see. When that was town down, why there wasn't anything there for a couple of years.
CE: Well, I don't understand why Union Carbide didn't pursue the uranium industry then, since they surely recognized the significance of it.
15

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
Well they did very shortly thereafter, see. After the army contract account was closed it was just a little while until the plant was rehabilitated. I was in Rifle, as I said as plant engineer, and I was transferred down to Uravan as plant superintendent to rehabilitate the plant and start up a uranium process.
About 1949? '48.
'48? I have--
In November '48.
I have a Daily Sentinel article dated April 24, 1949, in which it states that the Uravan plant is being reopened.
Uh huh.
So you went a few months before to begin that--
Right. We went in November of '48 and we had a carpenter foreman and a few men and they did all of the rehabilitation. This was Bill Cassidy, he was the carpenter foreman--
Oh.
Bill, or have you--?
CE: I'm going to talk with him.
JH: Well good. He's a very fine fellow. We got the plant 16
JH:
CE: JH: CE: JH: CE:
JH: CE: JH:
CE:
JH: Superintendent of construction actually. Do you know

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1 going.
CE: How did you get the people to come? Did you advertise, saying, "We need people in Uravan, Colorado for x [number of] jobs"?
JH: They all sort of heard that it was starting and came around looking for jobs. We didn't have a mine superintendent, so I bought the first ore, started buying the ore, and had the construction crew going and we got things organized. We had the commissary; we had to set it up. The company operated the commissary, or we did. Now it's contracted see. Then we had to provide amusement like a theatre, and some kind of recreation.
CE: What about churches?
JH: Churches. I even was a preacher a couple of different
times; I even conducted services.
CE: Wonderful. Wonderful. What did you talk about?
JH: I'll never know.
CE: Seriously, do you remember, do you have any idea what
you based your sermons on?
JH: No, I certainly don't.
CE: You don't remember?
JH: Uh uh. I often marvel that I did it; I probably
wouldn't be able to do it again.
CE: I'm sure that it was an inspiration; I'm sure that
17

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1 you inspired them.
JH: This only happened a couple of different times. Then we found a minister up around Nucla or somewhere, and so I would introduce him and he would carry on from then on.
CE: A community type service, or church that was non- denominational.
JH: Right. We had all different kinds of denominations. Then of course we had to operate the boarding house too, and the bunk houses were operated for single men and the staff house was operated for staff people who were single.
CE: Most of these people were miners, people who actually did the work in the mines.
JH: Mines and m ills.
CE: Oh, and mills.
JH: Then very shortly John Hill was more or less the
general manager at that time. He was general manager,
but I'm not sure of that beginning date. CE: '48 to '54, is that right, approximately? JH: Well, I was there from '48 to '52.
CE: But I mean Mr. Hill.
JH: Yeah, he was general manager from '48 to '54, yeah. Let's see--
CE: Had to take care of water supply and sewage. 18

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
JH: Oh yeah, there wasn't any water supply and the sewage
CE: JH:
was all in septic tanks, there was no sewer. Well, the water came out of the river and it was terrible. They had what they called tabawash water, which was a little purer.
Taba?
Taba wash, tabawash I guess. Then they had another spring up Atchison Creek and a lot of people would go up Atchison Creek and get jugs of water so that they would have drinking water. During the period I was superintendent there we put a water pipe, perforated pipeline in the bottom of the river one winter in an attempt to get water. It was an 18" pipe and we would put it in about two or three thousand feet long in the river bottom, and it gave us good water for a while until it plugged up, and then it got muddy and wasn't any good.
Well, it must have startled you one morning and you saw mud coming out.
Yeah, mud and fish.
Oh!
CE:
JH:
CE:
JH: You would get catfish, little baby catfish in the
water.
CE: Oh dear. Did you have a few women complaining?
JH: They all did. There weren't any that didn't. 19

 JOSEPH E . HOPKINS #1
CE: You had some company in your bathtub.
JH: Yeah. Well, let's see. We got the plant going and
operated it very successfully in the blue for years, and of course expanded it as we went along, and modernized it. Our staff increased and our people increased. And in 1952, along in December they offered me a job in Grand Junction to open an engineering department. The company didn't have an engineering set-up, and they wanted to have one for Uravan and Rifle. So they told me that I would be going to Grand Junction and opening an engineering office. We were from Alaska; my wife's folks were in Alaska. About the same time there was a job that opened in Alaska at a coal mine, the Ussabelley Coal Mine they called it. It was going to pay $1,000 a month, which sounded 1ike a lot of money at that time, [but itJ wasn't as much as I thought I was getting. But the prospect was in two years it would be paying $2,000 a month, see. So I left the company, I quit, very foolishly and went to Alaska again, and went to work for Ussabelley Coal Mine. I went up, we drove over the Alpine highway in January and it was 50 and 60 degrees below. My wife and three children and a dog. We got there and this didn't pan out at all. They were trying to--I had gone up and looked at
20

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
it; it didn't look too bad. But they were mining this coal at this low temperature with bull-dozers, it was a strip mining [operation]. They would just break down and they were way behind in their government contracts and it didn't pan out at all. It was r eal ly tough. So in the spring I left and went to work for U.S. Smelting Company again in an attempt to get back to the states. Finally it connected up with Titanium Metals in Henderson, Nevada. This was in 1953, and-- oh, I guess it was still '52. Anyway, I went to work for Titanium Metals as a shipping foreman and then became a day supervisor and was going along real good. Mr. Lundquist called me up one day in 1956 and said, "We have just signed a contract." I said, "What contract?" And he said, "Well, we're going to build three uranium plants. We are going to build one at Slick Rock [Colorado], Green River, Utah, and we are going to put a new plant in at Rifle. We were wondering if you would be interested in handling the construction of them, with Catalytic Construction Company." Catalytic Construction Company was the contractor on the design and the erection. He said, "If you would be interested you could go to work for
Catalytic and handle the construction and then after it's done you could come back to us and handle the
21

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
engineering department that we start out one time." I said, "I can't wait." So I came over for an interview. Unbeknownst to him, Catalytic had already hired someone to handle their job, see, in Philadelphia. He came about the same time I did. He was a local man, but he just was hired from Philadelphia. This was Bob Barney, who's now at the A. E. C. So Bob was project manager and I was his assistant. We worked real hard and got the three plants going within a year.
CE: That would be a challenge. Three plants in one year. Where did you get all the construction facilities you needed?
JH: We we got designs from Philadelphia, they did all the designs. We would get a package of drawings that was a foot in diameter, they were rolled. We had a staff downtown here in Grand Junction, and we would unroll these drawings and sort them out and there would be specifications with them too on certain things. We would put this together, this package, and go out for bids and select the contractors. He had contractors from Utah and Colorado and Wyoming and everywhere else working on these things.
CE: It took a long time just to get bids in.
JH: Yeah. We would give them about two weeks to give
22

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1 bids.
CE: Which is phenomenal, isn't it?
JH: Yeah. They would come back and we would get it built.
Each place had a superintendent, a construction superintendent. We would feed him all this information and we would feed him the contractors and help him get going, and it worked out pretty well. Then the plants, ahh operated. I went into the engineering department in 1957, in September.
CE: Now these were being built because of the great demand for uranium.
JH: Right. Now the plants at Slick Rock and Green River were not finished product plants, they were up- graders. They would take the stuff and upgrade it and then ship it into Rifle for refining. Rifle was rebuilt, as I said, closer to town on this side of town, which would be the west side. Before it was the east. You have been to Rifle have you? Not yet?
CE: Not yet.
JH: We had a lot of trouble with that plant for five or
six years, just an awful lot of trouble. The design wasn't really--we didn't have any trouble with construction, understand; everything worked out real well there. Actually it did. But the design, there were an awful lot of miscalculations and equipment
23

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
and things like that.
CE: Was i t because i t was being designed by people who really weren't familiar with the needs of this type of mill?
JH: I think so, although we really can't blame them too much because our company sent them a lot of information, fed them pretty near all the information we had. We had people going back and forth to Philadelphia. But some way or another it missed, and it just didn't work out like it should, like it was anticipated. But it's fine now, and it's been corrected, and it's going real great.
CE: In fact the pollution problem, isn't it cleared up? Mr. Beverly said--
JH: The pollution problem is better than any operating plant in existence I would say. You go up there on a day when the humidity is low and you come over a rise, they call it Webster Hill, and go down into the plant area, and you don't even see any pollutants, it's clear. Before you had these terrible chloride fumes all through the area, the valley and around.
CE: Tell me about your experience with the A.E.C. I'm interested in knowing what you did with them directly, and what your opinion is of how they
operated.
24

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
JH:
I never did have any real dealing with the A. E. C. myself. When I was in charge down in Uravan, most of the A. E. c. contact was done in Grand Junction with either Hill or Lundquist, see. But the A.E.C. would come down there and make periodic inspections, and at that time we would meet the different personnel. Most of them were fine people. I thought they were really on the ball and had good command of their job. They were particularly interested in the purchased ore sampling. We had samplers set-up, see. They would come down and check this ore. They hired a consultant from Denver by the name of Tedrow, to come over and take some samples of the ore. The reason why I remember Tedrow's name, when I was a child in Breckenridge, he was a superintendent of a big gold mine in Fairplay called the South London. I always kind of admired him and my Dad always spoke pretty highly of him. But he came over as a consultant for the A. E. C., and sort of conducted these sampling tests. They would take truckloads of ore, and they would take it to all the different sampling stations there were, like Montecello, Durango and Uravan; of course it was sampled there, and Rifle. And the different ones, and then they would compare the notes on it and see everybody was getting about the same
25

 JOSEPH E . HOPKINS #1
type of a sample. They were really pretty strict about that and did a good job in checking it. Of course it kept us on our toes. We were always trying to upgrade our equipment.
CE: JH:
Did they check the mines?
I think they did go out and look at some of the mines with--he had a mine superintendent by the name of Ev Paris; Ev has since died, and he was a real good friend of mine. I have a picture of him in here, if you have never seen a picture of him. He was quite an impressive fellow, we went to school together in Golden. Oh, now, what would you like while I'm looking for this? Here it is. He's the one on the left, I think.
Mine boss.
Yeah. That's that article that I'm going to give you. Good. You were the superintendent. You were a little younger then.
Quite a bit. Weren't we all [aged].
You don't look very much different real1y.
CE: JH: CE:
JH:
CE:
JH: No, not a whole lot.
CE: John Fraser. His name has been mentioned to me
several times.
JH: John is a wonderful fellow. He's sti11 alive, but
he's not too active anymore, he's suffering from
26

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1 emphysema.
CE: JH: CE: JH:
CE:
JH:
CE:
JH:
He had a broken hip too, did you know that?
And a broken hip too.
He's in a little rest home.
He's in the Medi-Center, yeah. John was load
superintendent when I was in Uravan and we worked very closely together.
Oh. The A.E.C. had regulations regarding various things including ventilation.
Yeah, mine ventilation they were pretty strict on that, too.
They just kept coming in and expecting to see that everything was proper.
Yeah, they sure did. I think they worked out pretty well. I think it was a good thing to have their assistance, because they had a lot of technical people that knew what the score was too. I think it worked out pretty good. Some of their people, like Hutchinson--have you ever met him or hear of him? Jim, I think is his first name. He's retiring right now; he has been in charge of procurement for years.
He's just a real fine fellow.
sixty-eight or seventy.
Is he an older man? Like eighty?
CE:
JH: No, I don't think he's that old. He might be 1ike
27

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
CE: Oh, well, it's not the same man. The boys have talked
with a man whom I think they said [was] eighty, who is very, very interesting.
JH: I don't think it's he, I don't think he's that old. It might be the same one.
CE: Then where did you go? JH: From--
CE: Rifle.
JH: Oh. From Rifle we went to Uravan and opened the mill,
and then operated the mill from '48 to '52.
CE: Then after the construction of the plants didn't you say you went back to Rifle, after constructing the
three mills?
JH: Oh excuse me. A fter the three m ills were constructed,
then I went to work for the company in Grand
Junction, in the Engineering Department. CE: I see.
JH: I worked on design as project engineer for quite a while. The fellow that--to back up, I was going to be in charge of this engineering department at one time. They hired a man to work for me by the name of Bill Barnes. But it so happened that when I came back I
worked for Bill, it was just the reverse. He was a real fine fellow and a good engineer and he finally left the company. I became "Bill the bart." Or he was
28

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
management engineer and I was called chief engineer because they wanted someone in here that would handle both the laboratory and engineering. He was called
CE: JH: CE: JH:
the manager of engineering, I guess, and I was chief engineer. Then in 1962 they had some work to do in New Jersey at one of the plastic plants. I went back there for six months.
Windier?
No, Union Carbide Plastics I think it was.
Oh.
I went back there and installed some huge blenders. Then I went to--the company was getting ready to put
in an asbestos plant in California, and it was under design. So I went to Niagara Falls and spent almost a year on design there. We were going great guns. These were huge engines; I have forgotten the size of them, but they would occupy a normal room, and we put two of them together.
You are talking about the blenders now? Yeah, double story.
Blending what?
CE:
JH:
CE:
JH: They were blending the material that was made in the
plant. It was a plastic material. They were a tumbling type thing. They would rotate. They were
b u i l t s o r t o f l i k e
t h i s , s e e . Y our t a p e w i l l
29

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
understand drawing, I guess.
CE: JH:
CE: JH: CE: JH: CE: JH:
Yeah. Okay.
Then this would tumble and blend all of the material. There were two of these huge things put side-by-side, and we installed them.
Union Carbide has many plastics.
Oh yeah.
It has a plastics division.
Right.
Uh huh.
Then as I said, I went to Niagara Falls and worked on the design of this asbestos plant. I wrote a lot of specifications and also helped procure a lot of the equipment. Then one day Bill Piper, who is more or less in charge, came in and said that they had a contract. They had shut down Green River, it was non- profitable. So then--
Wasn't it a fact that uranium was still being--?
Yeah, the ore that they had to treat there was carbonaceous ore from Temple Mountain, and it was pretty doggone hard to get any recovery out of it. That was the main reason, and then there were a lot of other things. Anyway, they were going to turn this
plant over to A tlantic Research. A tlantic Research was going to make a missile depot out of it. Would I
CE: JH:
30

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
be interested in going back to Colorado and getting this plant ready for Atlantic Research? So I couldn't wait to get back to Colorado, of course.
CE: Atlantic Research is probably a part of ---?--- is it?
JH: I think it might be, I don't know what the mother company is, it's in California. I came back and we had a certain amount of money and a certain amount of time to get this done. It took a contractor out there. We had to tear out everything that was of no value to Atlantic Research and dispose of it. It was agreed that we would sell it. So I cooked up a deal that we would sell it in place to several of the people around town. Local people like Western States Machinery and S. & M. Supply and different ones, and they would come out and contract to buy this equipment, or this structural steel. Then we would have the contractor take it down, at their expense, so we saved a lot of money. We got the job done for about half the appropriation and in about half the time. So then Atlantic Research took it over. Then I was--that started me on construction. I was on construction for--well, until a year ago. From one
plant to another putting in facilities, whatever it might be.
31

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
CE: And you moved you family each time?
JH: No. I didn't move the family at all. In the meantime
the kids had grown up and moved away and left the wife here and I would be gone. The last job was in Wyoming and I was up there a year. We didn't have a contractor in Wyoming, but I was the contractor. I used company men and put in a solid extraction circuit in our Wyoming operation and it worked out satisfactorily. Everything came along okay. So they wanted to have an industrial engineer. Bob Foss, who was the chief engineer at that time was made industrial engineer, and I again became chief engineer. I have been here for a year.
CE: You have really been around for the company, haven't you?
JH: Yes. And now you have it.
CE: Very interesting.
JH: Now, you are going to have to take another tape and
tell me about yourself.
CE: Tell me about some of the problems you had in the
mines. I'm interested in knowing, for instance, in Uravan. What do you do when you have problems in mines? Would you have problems with people, you know, an accident or just equipment problems when you're that remote from a center where you might get
32

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1 equipment?
JH: CE: JH:
You mean in some of the mines outside of Uravan?
Uh huh.
Well, in present day operations they just carry a-- not a surplus, but spare equipment. In the early days
if the equipment would break down you would just have to shut the mine down until you could get another hoist, or whatever the case might be, or get the parts to repair it. You might have to go to Denver for parts. Although during the war at Uravan there was a--Homer Woods was an old-time welder with the company, and he set up a Wood's Machinery Company. He had all kinds of equipment and parts and he also had a welding service. Later on he put in a machine shop service. He just really did well down there taking care of these mining ventures. His shop still operates. Of course, he's retired now, he did so well.
In Naturita?
No, he's in Grand Junction, I think.
Oh. Someone mentioned someone who did something similar to that who was in Naturita, that's why I asked. I have the name somewhere in my--
In your files.
In my myriad m aterials. 33
CE: JH: CE:
JH: CE:

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
JH: Yeah, you've got a lot of material.
CE: What about people who got hurt? Did you have a doctor
then?
JH: Oh yeah, we usually carried a doctor at Uravan. If
there were no doctor at Uravan there would always be
a doctor at Norwood.
CE: And that's close by
JH: Yeah. We had a doctor get killed when I was in
Uravan. He had a plane of his own, and just to give you an idea what we did, he took off this one morning with a man and his son and a lady and himself. They were going to Grand Junction, and the airport was up on top of a mesa, approximately four miles from Uravan and maybe fifteen hundred feet high, or two thousand feet high. Anyway, this happened to be a Saturday, and I happened to be over to the office and there was a farmer [who] came in and he said the doctor's plane has crashed, "And I just put blankets over all the people." I said, "Oh my gosh." So we got the wagon together, a power wagon of some kind and I thought maybe some of them were trapped in the plane, so we put on oxygen/acetylene and took various kinds of tools, and got the word around. Everybody took a car and they went up this very steep hill, up to the top. I called Grand Junction and told them about
34

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
that, and asked them to send a doctor down. So--
CE: Were there still some living?
JH: Yeah, he said they were still all okay, he thought.
And so I had these doctors come down; two of them came down. I had to kind of keep track of where they were. And they flew, see, and lit on the airport. The doctor didn't crash right on the airport, it was a remote area away from it. Then they went in and brought these people out. The man was not living, and the 1ittle boy's head was crushed, and he wasn't living. The doctor was very badly broken up, but he was still alive, and he told me that he was going to get along okay, wouldn't have any problem. His legs were just shattered, you might say. But when he got to Grand Junction he died too. The lady, she lived for a long time. She was unconscious, but she's very good now.
CE: Good.
JH: Fine.
CE: Did you have a clinic there then?
JH: The doctor had been running his clinic, and of course
when he died we had to make emergency repairs to get others. Now another time, in the mill there was a man who got his arm caught in some gears and it took his whole hand and arm up to his shoulder. He was in a
35

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
remote area, and he shouldn't have been working where he was alone, but he was there. He reached up underneath a guard, a safety guard, from a ladder and got caught. When they saw him, he was trying to reach into his pocket with his other hand to cut his arm off so that he could get down. They took him down and took him over to the hospital. I happened to be down and saw him going to the hospital. So I went in and they were going to amputate his arm, what was left of it. I asked them not to, to send him to Grand Junction, because I was afraid that there might be some chance that they could save more of it then they could in a mining camp. So they rushed him into Grand Junction. But they had to amputate it anyway. He lived for a few years and then he died.
CE: As a result of this, you think?
JH: I don't know if it was or not. I doubt if it was
really. I think it was probably because of pneumonia of something that he had contracted. Let's see, then other things were--if there was a person hurt up at some of the mines, they would rush them down to the
doctor at Uravan. Am I into too much detail for you? CE: No, I'm delighted to hear these things, because it's good to know that Union Carbide has always kept in
mind the welfare of their employees, even in remote
36

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1 areas like Uravan.
JH: Even on schools, they would have schools set-up out in these mining camps. They might only have six or eight children, but they would have a school building and someone to run it. They would get a teacher.
CE: What kind of housing did you provide? When you were the superintendent then you were responsible for opening this.
JH: We had houses already there, and they ranged from cabins to small, two-bedroom houses that were modern. Then while I was there we put in several other housing units. Today there are quite a number of houses, I don't rally know how many there are, but several hundred. They are all modern, very nice. About 150 I guess I should say.
CE: The company maintains them?
JH: The company maintains them and the people now pay
rent. It used to be they didn't pay rent.
CE: Probably very mininal.
JH: $35 or $40, something like that for a pretty nice
home. Then they pay their utilities. CE: The company pays them or the people? JH: The people do.
CE: Where are the public services from?
JH: Well they have R.E.A. Power and they have the propane 37

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
tanks set-up at the plant for the houses, and it's metered to each house. Water is now pretty good, they have wells. They have put wells down the last four years. The water is much better than it was, although one of the wells had become polluted, and just this last year we sealed it off, and got a hold of Dames and Moore soil people in Salt Lake City. They came over and sealed off the bad strata. They're back again in the water business.
CE: The company has to be in all kind of business, doesn't it, when it runs the company account--?
JH: Yeah, we ran the company commissary for years, had our own employee, a lady that did the best job. She was a boss.
CE: Women most always do.
JH: Oh yes. This was a Mrs. Guyer, she was postmistress
and commissary lady, and whatnot.
CE: When you say commissary, do you mean a company store? JH: Y eah.
CE: Do you?
JH: Uh huh. Meat and potatoes and dry goods, everything you could think of.
CE: Probably at prices less than one would have to pay if they came into Grand Junction.
JH: They used to be that way, but now I think they are 38

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
about comparable. Maybe a bit lower, but you don't really have the selection. Although there is a real good contractor there. I don't mean to say that, Pete Peters, he went in there in 1951, I guess, '50 or
'51. He's been there ever since.
CE: He's been there ever since?
JH: He's been there ever since, yeah. It used to be
Colter, George Colter had it. Pete was a partner, but Colter is gone now. I don't know if he is still living. They were from Climax; they had facilities up there. And then Peters ran the facilities at Gas Hills too for us.
CE: He leases the stores and provides the--
JH: Yeah, I think the company has to subsidize him on the meals a little bit. He runs the boarding house, the bunk houses, the stores, the commissary, the
drugstore and the beer hall.
CE: Even a beer hall, huh?
JH: Yeah, they even have a 3.2 beer establishment. [They]
didn't used to have that, liquor used to be
absolutely taboo, of any kind.
CE: When you were there?
JH: Well, about the time I got there they had changed it,
and so they have a 3.2 beer arrangement. CE: Why would it have been taboo before?
39

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
JH: I don¥t know. It was just against the law to bring
CE: JH: CE: JH:
any onto the property.
Company property.
Uh huh. But they decided people would have it anyhow. Just like prohibition, there was no--
Sure. And they would go out of their way to get it. So they sell packaged goods in the drugstore, and they have a little 3.2 beer establishment there. It works out real well, it isn't violated at all. No problems.
What do you remember about the social activities of Uravan while you were there, you and your family? Well, there would be a lot of cards played. The ladies would get together and have their teas and sewing bees and so forth. Then there were always the dances, the Saturday night dances. An orchestra would either be made up from the people there or brought in from Nucla and Naturita. This big recreation hall would be turned over to the dance people and it was really terrific. You never saw dances like that
before, and you don't see them anymore down there. Everybody would join in on the act, and the music was out of this world. It was country western to the first degree.
CE:
JH:
CE: Sounds like fun though. 40

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
JH: Oh yeah, it was, really good fun. There was one
fellow that was a clarinet player, he was also a bookkeeper there, Dick Morris, a young fellow. He really was good. He's no longer with us. He died years ago.
CE: So would you say that the mill or--what is the focal point in Uravan?
JH: The m ill.
CE: Is it?
JH: Uh huh. That's what keeps the people there. If it
weren't for the mill there wouldn't be any mining. And if it weren't mining for the mill there wouldn't be any people. So I think it would be the focal point.
CE: Were there any miners who came from foreign countries and lived in that area?
JH: Yeah, there were quite a few. There were a lot of Spanish people. Here in more recent years there have been a lot of Indians come up from New Mexico. They use Indian labor a lot.
CE: Are they segregated or do they prefer to be segregated in Uravan?
JH: No, I wouldn't say so. They sort of all get together and mix together, use the same stores and same boarding house, the same this and that.
41

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
CE: People are generally very sociable with one another? JH: Yeah, you have to be in such a small area. There have
been occasions when there have been Negro people there, and [there's] no reason why they shouldn't [be there]. I don't know if there are any there at the moment or not. They have had Negro employees there.
CE: I saw this plaque out in the lobby which states that Union Carbide does encourage fair practices, and I think that's significant to put it right there. Anyone can see it.
JH: Sure, right on the entrance. I think each plant has one on its--
CE: Did you find that many of the wives worked, or couldn't that happen?
JH: Well, some did, but there weren't too many jobs for them. Some would work in the store and some would work in the post office, and there were always some at the boarding house. But I wouldn't say that it was a large percentage.
CE: Was it a problem because you were remote from bigger towns?
JH: Well, the only trouble with it was the fact that the roads were all dirt roads from here to Uravan.
[END OF S I D E ONE]
JH: From here to Uravan was a graveled, dusty road that
42

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
took a good three hours to drive it, if you were used to the road. Then if you wanted to go out the other way to Norwood and then on around into Montrose and then Grand Junction, it also was dirt, clear to Norwood anyway. It made slow travel and very dirty travel and you didn't go anymore than you had to.
You stayed home and saved your money.
CE:
JH: Yes. You would even have flash floods on the road. I
can remember one time we were coming in and bringing everybody into the dentist and we had to sit for an hour and a half or two hours waiting for a flash flood to subside before we could cross this draw that was right in the road; Salt Creek Wash.
CE: Do you think a company that runs a town such as Urivan, because it is a big brother, so to speak, is creating problems with paternalism? Do you think people take advantage or take for granted the services that the company provides?
JH: Well I don't think too much, because they can be cut off if they--what am I trying to say? If they mutilate it, or misbehave they can be rejected and kept away from it. In other words they can't abuse
the privileges and still get by. They have to get
along with people.
CE: Did the unions ever come in while you were there?
43

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
JH: Uh huh, came in while I was there.
CE: I'm interested in hearing about that.
JH: Well, they came in, and one fellow was hired here in
Grand Junction and came down there as a mechanic, and he was a good mechanic. He was also a very good organizer. He would go around and organize all the things, get them going. Then they would have their election. It took quite a while for the union to get in, but they finally did, and it's a good union.
CE: Mine workers?
JH: Yeah. United Mine Workers. They are very good and
they have been there a long time, and they--there's a
lot of things that they have helped.
CE: Have they? For instance?
JH: Well, they get all the fellows together, they seem to
have a common interest. I guess that they are all working for the same thing. They have their own meetings and their own organizations and it gives them something to do. I think it's all pretty much for the good.
CE: Do you have any special problems?
JH: Such as?
CE: Well, what you do with a widow of an employee?
JH: You move her to Grand Junction.
CE: Oh, do you? When they had, for instance, while they
44

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
were there when the houses were free, [now wouldJ they have to leave?
JH:
Yeah, we had one case that was like--it sticks in my mind. It was a man by the name of Big Bennett, he was a miner up at Lomb Park 6. He had a family, a real nice family, and he lived on the club ranch. He would do ranching in the meantime, you know, in between his mining. One day his tractor turned over. He was a great barrel-chested man; his tractor up-ended and came over and crushed him, and he died. His family stayed on for a while, but they eventually moved to Grand Junction. There just isn't anything for a
family to do down there by themselves, especially if they have children that are in school, it would be better for them to get out and go to school in Grand Junction. Make room for those that are down there. Schools are good in Uravan, they always have been. Well, was there a lot of turnover?
In the schools, or--?
No, in just the town.
Oh, in the people. No, not too much.
People seemed generally happy and satisfied. They seemed to be pretty well satisfied, yeah.
Well, as a closing question, will you tell me what a chief engineer does? What do you do specifically now?
CE: JH: CE: JH: CE:
JH: CE:
45

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
JH: I do everything that nobody else wants to do.
CE: I'm sure that's not true.
JH: Oh, we design projects for the plant. They have
capital accounts that say they want to put in a new facility, the plant will want to put in a new facility. They will put it into their budget for the coming year. After they have gotten approval we design it for them, and then we procure the materials and select the contractor, if it's to be installed by a contractor, and we. have it installed. Here lately they have been kind of watching the installation at the plants themselves. We just make occasional trips from here to see it. We have a small crew here, a mechanical engineer and draftsman, and they handle most everything. We had five or six people in the department a year ago, but we have been cutting back. So the three of us handle everything there is. We also handle all the surplus property. We coordinate that between the mining and the milling at the various locations. We work with South Charleston, West Virginia, which is set-up as an investment recovery department for the corporation. South Charleston takes--we have a surplus piece of equipment and we transfer it to them and that takes it off from our books and puts in into investment
46

 JOSEPH E. HOPKINS #1
recovery. Then they try to sell it for us. We handle small purchases and things like that, although we usually go through purchasing. Contracts, we
interview the contractors and things like that.
CE: What's going to happen once this A.E.C. stretch-out program ends? Is that why you are cutting back,
because that ends?
JH: Not so much as that, it's just that we don't have so
much work as we used to have. CE: Ore depletion.
JH: Ore depletion and the fact that the plants are pretty well in good operating condition and don't need to do as many improvements as they did before.
CE: I guess that speaks well of your ability.
JH: Well I wouldn't say that, because I wasn't here all
the time. A lot of people have been in on that.
CE: Is there anything else that you would like to
contribute?
JH: No, I don't think so, I can't think of anything at
the moment.
CE: Well, thank you very much. If you do, I hope that you
will let me know and we'll begin again, okay? JH: I certainly will Miss Engle.
CE: Thank you.
