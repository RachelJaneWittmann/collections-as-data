GB: Mr. Ebbley, as a means of introduction, would you please describe your present position and a little bit of your background.
NE: You mean with relation to the uranium industry?
GB: Yes.
NE: Well, I came to Grand Junction in the early fall of 1947
and set up the original exploration and diamond drilling program for the United States Geological Survey and I was in charge, at that time, of the physical phase of the program, of actually setting up the drilling camps and the physical phase of the diamond drilling itself. And I stayed in this capacity with the U.S.G.S. until the late spring of 1949, when I resigned to go with the management of Camp Bird Mine at Ouray, Colorado. I stayed there three years and then came back and started doing consulting work for the Uranium Ore Producers Association, an organization that was started by the independent uranium producers so that they would have a
collective bargaining organization to discuss various points. [INAUDIBLE PORTION OF TAPE]
NE: --and the great hurry that was necessary at that time to try to evaluate the uranium potential for the Colorado

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1
Plateau area was such that the, that very little actual exploratory drilling was done and most of the work was confined to the assaying of these various mines, the small openings that were available, trying to determine as best they could the potential of ore reserves. As I
GB:
NE: GB:
NE:
say, very little diamond drilling was done so actually the program was not too accurate, but under the circumstances I think they did a fairly good job.
Was the principal source of uranium coming from the Morrison formation at this time?
Yes, that's correct.
Why did it take so long to discover that the Chinle and Shinarump formations also had great potential?
Well, they had known that the Shinarump formations and Chinle formations were productive, could be productive of uranium, but in most instances they were quite deep and had not been developed to any extent at that time. All the previous production, or probably 90% of it or better had come from the Morrison formation. It wasn't until the uranium boom actually that deep drilling exposed some of these large deposits in the Shinarump and of course, it later turned out that they were the most productive, at least in tonnage wise.
Was it lack of sophisticated equipment that prevent this?
GB:
NE: It had a great deal to do with it. There's no question
2

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1 about that.
GB:
NE:
What changed in drilling techniques allowed the miners to drill deeper?
Well, perhaps the greatest change in drilling techniques was the fact that prior to that time, until about 1948 all the drilling that had been done was done by small diamond drills using EX barrels which resulted in poor
recovery and actually limited it to shallow depths. In 1948, the fall of '48, I made several trips to Texas to interest some of these oil well drilling companies in that area to come in and bid on some of these government drilling contracts, using what is called a long-hole machine, or a rotary drill and drills a four to five inch hole. Well, several of these companies came into this area and bid on the government drilling contracts and we were able to reduce the average price from about $3.50 to $4.00 a foot, down to $1.00 and $1.25 a foot, and to considerable depths. I think perhaps that was the greatest change in drilling technology at that time. How would that compare with drilling as it is known
today?
Very similar. They use the same type of rotary riggs. What about sampling? How has sampling changed?
You mean in the mills or where?
Yes.
GB:
NE: GB: NE: GB:

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1
NE: Well, that's a whole story in itself. The mills in 1950
and '51 all had sampling, automatic sampling plants that were inefficient actually in getting a fair sample and that was one of the first programs that the Uranium Ore Producers Association tried to correct this particular inequity. And several of the engineers from the Uranium Ore Producers Association got permission to examine the various sampling plants from all the mills in the area, and because of this the mills were required to rebuild all these sampling plants so that the miner would get a fir shake in their sampling. Actually, some of these sampling plants had to be revised at costs up to $60 and $70,000. I don't know if you're familiar with the sampling plants but an automatic sampling plant is the most dangerous thing in the world if it's not absolutely correct. Because if it's giving a poor sample, it will give a poor sample day in and day out, day in and day out, even worse than actually hand sampling which is not too accurate. But this condition was corrected in 1952 and 1953.
GB: How was it corrected? What did they change?
NE: Well, they redesigned their sampling plants so that the plant was giving a more accurate sampling. The carnotite ore itself is real soft and it, much of it turns into flour when its crushed and it's difficult to sample it
4

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1
unless the plant is set up correctly.
GB: Many of the independent miners often claim, or often complain that they were being cheated on their assays. That their ore was actually richer than the buyer was telling them.
NE: A lot of the small miners, the independent miners feel that way. However, I don't think that they were being cheated, and we proved they were being cheated, by the inefficiency of the automatic samplers. I think that was the main cause.
GB: In 1955, as you're well aware, there were many people concerned with the leasing program and other inequities associated with the AEC. What was wrong with their leasing program?
NE: Well, there are quite a few basic things that are wrong with the program. Perhaps the main one was the secrecy that was involved. Every time that the Atomic Energy Commission decided to award one of the pieces of ground that had been withdrawn by the Atomic Energy Commission, this was done behind closed doors and even though there might be anywhere from 350 to 400 applications, for that particular lease, it was awarded to one company, or one person and there is no recourse as far as the other applicants were concerned to find out why it was given to
this particular person or company or why their 5

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1
application was turned down. Of course, the Uranium Ore Producers fought this problem tooth and nail for years and years and finally at some of the hearings held in
1955, the pressure was so great on the Atomic Energy Commission to change their method of allocation that they quit giving out any leases at all. At that time these were called ML mineral leases of the AEC. The Commission at that time, on the withdrawn parcels of land that had been withdrawn by the Atomic Energy Commission over a period of years might go in and spend a hundred to two hundred thousand dollars of the taxpayer's money drilling out some ore body, on this withdrawn land, to the extent that they might know that this ore body is worth maybe several million dollars net to whoever was awarded this lease. So, by some arbitrary method the committee that awarded these leases sat behind closed doors and I don't know whether they rolled dice to see who got it or what, but they would turn around and give it to some company or to some individual with no explanation why or the reason nobody else got it and even though maybe 75% of the applicants that had their names in for this lease were qualified, experience-wise, financially wise and being good American citizens. So it was a real give-away with absolutely no comeback from industry to find out how and
why a certain person was awarded these leases. Of course, 6

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1
we have--the Uranium Ore Producers--have many accounts on record where the Atomic Energy Commission has stated, not publicly but privately that any member of the Uranium Ore
GB:
NE: GB:
Producers Association that had an application in for the lease might as well forget it because they weren't gonna get one. This is quite damaging evidence. We have it in black and white. So this thing was fought over a period of years and so finally we raised so much stink they just quit giving these leases out entirely.
Was it because of this hostility that they, that the AEC said that a member of this group would never get a lease? Yes, that was right.
At the beginning of the leasing program the AEC had two alternatives for leasing. One was competitive bidding, the other was what they called granting a lease in terms of an applicant's financial ability to raise money and his experience. What would the Uranium Ore Producers Association have thought about competitive bidding?
Well, they were against that, of course, because the majority of the members of the Uranium Ore Producers Assoc. were small miners and small producers and they certainly would be in no position to bid against a major company for a large block of ore.
NE:
GB: Well, the Uranium Ore Producers came up with a proposal of a lottery system based on qualified applicants, both
7

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1
financially and experience-wise, and the fact that you're not a communist and so forth. We thought the only fair way to do this is to put everybody's name in a hat and have a public drawing.
GB: It's been said that some of the companies that were granted AEC leases did not have the necessary experience in the field of uranium mining, to warrant such a lese. A few of the companies in mind were Bartholin Co., Ortmeyer was mentioned and Cycle. To what extent is this true?
NE: Well, it can always be said, of course, and it was one of the AEC's arguments that anybody regardless of mining experience, if they were awarded a lease, they could hire competent engineers and mine managers to carry out the actual production. In some cases, like Golden Cycle and Shattuch Den mining companies that were awarded large ore bodies under this program, even though they had had no prior experience in uranium mining they were companies that had a lot of mining experience and that didn't make any particular difference.
GB: Some of the uranium miners of the early 50's often charged that the AEC was very incompetent. They had no feel for the uranium business. Do you have any comments on that?
NE: Well, they had hired various engineers from industry on 8

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1
their staff that were good men. Back in about 1950 or '51 I believe they set up a mine operation of their own under AEC supervision and AEC personnel endeavoring to arrive at a cost figure of producing uranium ore. This turned out to be a real fiasco because their costs were so high
it was ridiculous. I think that was the only time that
they really tried to do anything like that on their own. GB: The AEC also has said that many of the small, independent miners weren't capable of handling these ore bodies. That it would take a large company who would then subcontract
these. Do you think that some of the smaller miners like Mr. Day and Mr. Bosley would be capable of handling some of those large ore bodies?
NE: Yes I believe so because if they were awarded the ore body why they wold have no trouble at all in getting outside finance sufficiently to open the ore body by developing headings and put the mine into production. Because most of the leases that were given out had blocked out ore reserves and tonnages and grades that were known to exist. Anyone who was awarded one of those leases could go right out and get the money right off the
bat to develop the mine and property.
GB: Do you think there was any political favors, say, done in
the awarding of leases?
NE: If there had been any political favors, why we wouldn't,
9

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1
at least I wouldn't be aware of them. As I mentioned before, this thing is done in complete secrecy and there's never any reason given before or after the awarding of the lease why it was given to any particular company.
GB: In other words, they just showed a favoritism to big firms then.
NE: Well, in some cases, I can mention one case I'm very familiar with because I had an interest in this thing. They had a big ore body more or less blocked out but not completely down in Club Mesa and this was coming up for a lease so at that time I went down and examined the surface of the ground and took the numbers of the drill holes, the government numbers and I took this up with Mr. Fred Searle who was the chairman of the Board at that time of the Newmont Mining Company, one of the Major mining companies in the world, to interest him in application for this lease. Mr. Searle was interested and we put in an application listing the hole numbers in the area so there would be no question of the, where the ground was located. Subsequent to that why Mr. Searle received a letter from the Atomic Energy Committee stating that they had decided to hold back on issuing
this lease for the period of a year or so and then after this, the following winter, the Atomic Energy Commission
10

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1
went back in on this same block of ground and spent roughly another $42,000 of taxpayer's money doing additional drilling in between some of these ore holes to beef up the ore body which would not have been necessary
at all, if Newmont been awarded the lease because they would have done this drilling themselves at their own cost. After this second drilling was done why a representative of the Atomic Energy Committee went to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and contacted Tom Newell who was general manager of Shattuck Den Mining Co., who had never been in the uranium business before and showed Mr. Newell the drill results, the assays, the tonnage and grade estimates of this ore body and asked him if Shattuck Den would be interested in the lease and he accepted. Now that is rather an odd situation because New Mount would have gone in and done this secondary drilling all by themselves instead of having the government spend another
$42,000 and then go out and slip it to a mining company that hadn't even known about the lease and had no application in for it at that time, even though there were probably two or three hundred applications for this particular block. These things, of course, the Uranium Ore Producers could never understand and also we never got any explanation.
GB: Once the Atomic Energy Commission's leasing program got 11

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1
under way, it seemed as though these leases were quite attractive to the independent miners. They were attractive to everyone, in fact. But at the beginning they had problems getting the program going. Just why did
an independent miner, why did he want an AEC lease?
NE: Well, of course, that's very easy to answer because any of these leases that were given out by the Atomic Energy Commission had blocked out ore reserves in tonnage and grade and anybody that was awarded one of those leases
automatically made money on it. You couldn't lose, because the economics of the ore body and producing the ore and selling it gave good profit.
GB: Would you explain this directed ore clause that you mentioned earlier?
NE: Yes, the directed ore clause had great influence prior to the investigation of these sampling plants. The AEC, of course, is the sole buyer of the uranium and these government leases, they could tell the producer to ship his ore to this mill, if they wanted to, or have him ship it to another mill. And we have documentary evidence for some of the mills prior to the redesigning of some of these sampling plants, were getting results as much as 25 or 30 percent lower than the ore grade at some other
mills on the same ore over a period of months and months. The producer had no right to say where he wanted to send
12

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1
this ore even if he was getting a better assay and better returns from some other mill. So this directed ore clause was quite a vicious thing too while it lasted.
NE: What finally became of this?
GB: Well, it kind of worked itself out where all of these
various sampling plants were redesigned during that period and were put back in good shape and were checked on about every six months period by the Colorado School of Miners Research Foundation and some of these other organizations who ride herd on the correct sampling procedure, why the directed ore clauses then didn't mean too much.
GB: In what other ways, or what other gripes did the independent miner have with the Atomic Energy Commission? In what ways did they feel they were being dealt inequities?
NE: Well, one other major point I think that was very inequitable at that time was the fact that not only the USGS, but the AEC were doing drilling, not only on withdrawn ground, that was under the jurisdiction of the
AEC but they were also doing extensive drilling on private ground held by various mining companies and individuals and in some cases drilling completed by the government on some of this private ground amounted to many hundreds of thousands of dollars which was tax money
13

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1
spent for the benefit of some individual. There was no recourse and many individuals would go in and apply for government drilling and they would be turned down and then shortly after maybe their neighbor would be getting
several hundred thousand dollars worth of drilling done on their property. And like the secret matter of allocation of these ML leases, the government drilling was handled the same way.
GB: What did the miners think about the United States government purchasing a portion of its ore from, let's say the Belgium Congo or Canada when many of them indeed knew that there was more than enough ore here in this area?
NE: Well, I don't think that's quite accurate. Up until about 1948 or '49 or even 1950, the ore reserves in the Colorado Plateau area, which was the principal domestic producing area, were very low. The ore bodies were small and scattered and actually you couldn't pinpoint any large overall tonnage and grade. And of course, prior to that time and during the war years the Atomic Energy Commission had made these contracts with the Belgium Congo and Shingolovi District for the uranium produced from that area because that was the main source of the
world supply at that time. And, of course, these contracts overlapped the period when the Colorado Plateau
14

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1
started producing large amounts of uranium. In fact, I can remember, back in either late 1948 or 1949, I attended a convention in San Francisco, and the head of the Raw Procurement Division of the AEC gave a paper at that time in San Francisco in which he stated that
although the Colorado Plateau was an interesting area as far as possible uranium reserves were concerned, that actually it never would be an appreciable producer. Of course, this gentleman years later would like to have eaten those words many times because the Colorado plateau area and surrounding areas like New Mexico and Wyoming did have and have tremendous reserves that were not even dreamed of in those days.
GB: You were with the USGS for awhile, is that right?
NE: Yes, that is right.
GB: Were there any big discoveries of ore made at that time
that you can recall?
NE: Not during the time I was with the USGS. The last full
year I was with the USGS, we drilled practically 250,000 feet of diamond drill hole on the Colorado Plateau area and actually did not come up with any major ore bodies, or any appreciable tonnage in fact. However, after I had left in the late Spring of 1949, the program was continued and with much better results; actually quite a
few ore bodies started to be discovered. 15

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1
GB: Being familiar with both government-directed exploration
and private exploration, can you see any difference
between the two?
NE: No, not a great deal. Outside the government is in a
position to do quite a bit more wildcatting type of drilling because they're using taxpayer's money, while the individual has to watch it more carefully.
GB: What effect did the AEC incentives, such as bonuses and things like that have on the industry here in the Plateau?
NE: Well, it was a great help actually, of course. The haulage allowance and the various bonuses they had, developing bonuses at fifty cents a pound.
[INAUDIBLE PORTION]
GB: Did the miners ever feel they were being paid too low for
their ore?
NE: Well, of course, everybody always feels that way.
GB: But it was in such demand and they were getting so low-- NE: Well, that was quite a problem in the--
[INAUDIBLE PORTION]
NE: --war, that was one of the prime concerns of the industry
and through concerted effort through the producers in the Colorado Plateau and the United States Senators in Colorado, why the price was raised up to the Circular Five which held for a good many years, and amended
16

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1 several times.
GB: What did you say happened to the Uranium Ore Producers A ssociation?
NE: Well, it carried through quite active until about, the last active years were about 1960 or '61 and it's kind of died out a kind of natural death for lack of interest. Has there been anything to take its place since?
GB: NE:
Not that I know of. There's a new organization that was set up here a few months ago called the Western Uranium Association which is an organization very similar to the original Uranium Ore Producers Association and they have banded together to try and use some influence with the Atomic Energy Commission in the allocation of these withdrawn areas that the government still has, which the AEC has indicated that they are planning to release sometime in the near future.
This then is the only collective bargaining agency that is left for the area?
For miners only, yes.
Is there anything you would like to add? I have no more questions.
No, other than the fact that, as I mentioned previously, all this data has been written down and hashed over and it's pretty well written out in these books I have and I still think you that you probably ought to read this
GB:
NE: GB:
NE:
17

 NORMAN EBBLEY # 1
information over and I think it will give you some, probably some real good questions that you might not know now.
GB: Thank you.
