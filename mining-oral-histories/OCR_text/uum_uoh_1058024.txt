 [THE FOLLOWING I S AN INTERVIEW WITH DONALD HITLAND, CONDUCTED BY RICH GIBBS AND GREG BROLIN AT THE A. E. C. COMPOUND IN GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO ON JULY 27, 1970.J
RG: --and we'd like to know a little bit about you, something about your background and your experience in the industry here in the Atomic Energy compound.
DH: You mean like when I first started and things like this? Let's see, I came with the Atomic Energy Commission April 2, 1952, and I came here from the University of Washington in Seattle. I might say that this was the first job that I'd had after I got out of college. Went right to the commission. I've been with them ever since, and travelled and probably worked in all of the western states. Actually, I've moved my family, let's see, it seems to me once my wife and I counted up once something like seventeen different times. They were all good moved. They didn't hurt me or anything. My wife got a little upset. We'd buy a home and move. Lived in the one in Reno for four months; just bought the house, lived in
it four months. I 'd get transferred out just after I'd buy the house and fix it up the way we wanted; lose money every time. But I had various jobs with them. Started out as a GS-5 which is a basic--goes even higher these days. And had these big project chiefs knowing about project jobs. So I don't know what else--have you got something in mind I haven't

 DONALD HITLAND #1 covered?
GB: Oh yes. Basically during your early years, what was your first function, what did you do during your first few years with the A.E.C.?
DH: Well, our first few years we were strictly reconnaissance. In other words, I went to Butte, Montana and I was hired to work there for a guy named Millard Rainer(?). The office had just opened up; a three-man office and a secretary. And from that office we covered the states of Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and I guess Colorado and Wyoming. We were doing strictly reconnaissance. At that time we had no idea that some of the best uranium potential was in tertiary basins. We were looking for vein type deposits. We would go into the old mining districts with scintillation counters and check all
the mine dumps. We might spend a week in one little district just checking dumps, walking with a scintillator. We did it fairly systematic. We'd start, say, and go county by county in Montana. Since we were stationed in Montana, probably most of our time was spent there. But when we hit the other states such as Oregon and Washington, it was quite an effort to get out there. We had to have travel authorization and things like that. So we'd only go
2

 DONALD HITLAND # 1
out there when somebody submitted a sample to us. So we'd make two or three of these trips a year. When I was in Butte, as you know they have extremely cold weather there in the winter, so in the fall or about October and November, why, we'd, the family and I would pack up and go south. The first winter I went to Kingman, Arizona where thought we had an area that was favorable for uranium deposits. I went down there with another fellow. We took our families and actively did reconnaissance of what they call the Surbad(?) Mounta ins around Kingman, A rizona. Stayed there four months and then back up to Butte. And then worked around Butte again that year, and then the
next winter back down to southern Utah around St. George, Utah. Worked there five months and then back up to Butte. Just got to Butte, and they decided then that they wanted to open an office in Nevada. They asked me if I wanted to go, and I said, yeah, I would go. I was the first man over there, didn't have any office space or anything, but at that time we had the University of Nevada doing some metallurgical work for the commission. Well, they agreed to give us office space, so we went to the Nevada School of Mines. I worked there for about three months by myself, and then they sent some other fellows in and
3

 DON A L D H I T L A N D # 1
the Bureau of Mines opened up a big office and so we moved up in the new building with them. I was there for about another six months and then I went to Spokane and I stayed for six years.
RG: Uh huh. Now during the winter months did you do the same type of work in St. George and Kingman that you were doing up North?
DH: Essentially the same thing, yes. The only difference was that your host rocks were a little different. In other words, up there we had mostly granitic type rocks; down in Arizona we were looking more for sediments. It was the same. It was reconnaissance type; we checked in mining dumps. And whenever pulled
into a town, why, if there was any potential prospectors around they seemed to bring out the worst in me. They would just flock to your place, especially the weekends when we'd get in. They'd line up outside your motel or house waiting to show you rocks and trying to find out where they should prospect, and zillions of other questions they wanted to know. But this did take a lot of our time. Just running down leads. They'd bring you some rock, and it might have a little bit of a count in it, but very few of them actually even panned out.
RG: Do the mere fact that some A.E.C. people moving into 4

 DON A L D H I T L A N D # 1
area, like explorers you'd set off some excitement in that area.
DH: We did, yeah. Usually there would be a write-up in the local paper and something on the radios. It actually created a little bit of excitement just on the news media. But then we'd draw them in from all the other counties, and consequently we were actually
looking at properties hundreds of miles away from what our primary target was. If they'd give us a sample that was halfway decent, we'd go see it. So this is one of the things we used to have to put up with. We'd pull in a motel at night, and at that time all of our vehicles had the Atomic Energy Commission written right on it, see and that--
you all night. Usually we didn't mind to much because we were looking for leads. It was probably the best thing that we could do because going in an area cold you've to do--well, these guys were actually prospectors.
RG: Did you ever go into an area cold?
DH: Oh yeah. We have, especially in Oregon. For some
reason we couldn't seems to get people interested out in Oregon.
Dead give-away.
RG:
DH: Yeah, dead give-away. And they'd be there to bother
5

 DONALD HITLAND # 1
RG: Were there ever any significant finds in that area? DH: No, there wasn't. We had some ideas as to where we
should look for uranium. We used to associate cobalt, nickel, and silver with uranium mainly because in the Chingaloa(?) Mine in Africa that was one of the associated minerals. So consequently, we would look at anything we had. These three minerals are written on some bulletin or something, why, we'd say, we better go check this area for uranium because they're usually associated. So we would go out there in northwestern Oregon. They've got a lot of nickel. We used to think this was an excellent place to look for uranium. We went in there dead cold because nobody-- they hadn't even heard of uranium mining out there.
There was just a forest that didn't pay off.
RG: Were you ever involved in any drilling?
DH: Yes, not as much as the guys here on the plateau.
See, until 1961 I was what you'd call the outside-- well, off-plateau. The plateau has always been the most prolific producer. So we were kind of on the outskirts, and consequently we didn't get into so much drilling as those on the plateau~ Now we did do some drilling in the Boulder Vat up around north of Butte, and we did some drilling in the Coeur d'Alene Mining District, diamond drilling around Kellogg--
6

 DON A L D H I T L A N D # 1
underground. This was underground---?--- And they were small, small drilling towns. But they were more expensive because they were all diamond drilling. Most of them were angle holes rather than just the
old straight vertical wagon drilling or rotary type. However, this ended much earlier than, say, the drilling on the plateau because they just weren't too profitable. The targets were small and chances were
smaller.
GB: During this period what were theories of depositions
you were going after?
DH: In those days in the particular areas where we were
working, it was strictly hydrothermal. That's why we were always looking for vein type deposits because at that time we hadn't--well, tertiary basins were practically unknown. I mean tertiary-basin deposits, uranium deposits were practically unknown at that time. Consequently, right now in the Montana basins, say, around Butte you're undergoing a second cycle or they're practically back in the same area as we were looking except they're looking in the basins; we were looking for hydrothermal type vein deposits.
GB: What do you feel is the reasoning behind the length of time that it took to discover these deposits in other formations other than the Morrison, like on the
7

 DONALD HITLAND # 1 plateau?
DH: Well, I think one of the reasons was preconceived ideas. Who would have thought those tertiary basins-- wel1, just 1ike I went down to Texas here not too long ago, and I went out where these uranium deposits are, you know, and they' re farm lands. Y ou'd never think there could be deposits in this kind of stuff. It's the poorest looking environment you'd ever seen
for uranium, but mainly because there's no other mining here. We usually associated uranium deposits with other minerals. That's another thing. That's why we hit the Coeur d'Alene Mining District, the Butte District--you know, one period of mineralization. But one thing we didn't realize is that uranium is very mobile and it has a different source than a lot of
these other ones because you get a tough(?) bed; you don't have to have any hydrothermal deposits. Consequently, you go out in some of these basins and where there's tabaceous (?) material above you, and you've got a terrific host there. I don't know if that answers your question or not. I think we had just these preconceived ideas. We wanted to associate it all with mineralized areas. We knew there was
other minerals.
RG: You mentioned you were in reconnaissance mostly. Did
8

 DONALD HITLAND #1
you ever use air reconnaissance?
DH: Yes. We were, we would be asked periodically to suggest favorable areas that could have possibilities that could be found by flying. And I guess we probably picked up maybe four or five recommendations in Montana, two in Oregon; I recommended some in Washington, though they never excepted it; and it seemed to me that we had two flown in Oregon. Another thing I should mention is that we also associated uranium with mercury deposits. Oregon has been quite a producer or mercury. There's a lot of occurrences
in there. So when we were asked to recommend airborne areas, we'd pick out these mercury deposits as, say, the center of where we wanted airborne ---?---. On the basis of that we recommended two areas and they were flown and they were negative.
RG: What was involved in air reconnaissance?
DH: Well, first of all, you've got to have some target; you've got to bear in mind some formation which is
favorable for uranium deposition; and then you've got to take in mind the topography. I mean, is the topography of the area favorable for flying? Is it too rough? Is it too high? Do you have enough outcrops there to make it worthwhile? You've got to have a base to work from. What kind of maps have you
9

 DONALD HITLAND #1
got so you can orient yourself? You've got to do it systematically and you can't unless you've got some maps. Today we're getting in such a condition that we've got some type of map almost of every area. Now the accuracy is sometimes questionable, and that's
another thing. How costly is it going to be? Are we going to get anything out of it to warrant the cost? Let's see. Another thing is, what's the priority? Sometimes you've got--depends on how much money you've got whether it' s--they' 11 only allocate so much money to actually go out and fly these areas. Based on this, you've got to decide, well, which area you actually want to fly. Maybe some other area, like the guys in Wyoming might have a higher priority. This is a basic assumption you've got to take.
RG: During the boom years were the A.E.C. exploration teams actually limited by a tight budget like that when uranium was in such a great demand?
MH: I would say that during most of this time, no. However, I'm probably thinking more in the later years when things started tightening up. But, say, in
'50 to '55, I don't think you really had a problem there. If you had an area that looked real good and you have a few anomalies, ground anomalies or where somebody picked up a decent sample, you could usually
10

 DONALD HITLAND #1
get the darn thing flown. That's right.
RG: You mentioned that in exploration on foot you used a scintillator. Are there any other types of equipment that you used?
DH: For prospecting we'd usually use a scintillator. We used a scintillator for prospecting, and if you're going to have a sample, you want check it, you use a geiger counter. See, a scintillator is much more sensitive. When you drive, say, we're going from here to Salt Lake City. We might be going through some mountains, and so we turn the scintillator on and one guy will be driving and the other guy will be watching this thing. It was just routine. Wherever we went that you probably hadn't been before, you'd travel with the scintillator. Now, a geiger counter would do you no good, see.
RG: Were you personally involved in any exploration of any claims or any deposits that ever became large producers of uranium ore?
DH: Not large producers, no. I was involved with some of those small ones up in the Boulder Vat, but none of them developed into big mines. Probably in the Spokane area in, say, 1955 when the Midnight Mine,
which is the biggest mine so far in the Northwest. It had been found in 1954 and I got there in 1955, so I
11

 DONALD HITLAND #1
can't take credit for any of it. But we watched it grow and kept track of it and the reserves and potential, so I would say that, no, I was not
involved in the discoveries of any major deposit ore
district.
RG: What about some of the local miners, when you would
pull into a town, as you said, you would have these people bringing their samples to you. Did any of those ever pan out?
DH: Oh, I guess there was another one in Spokane. And it was called the Peter's Lease, and it's now probably is the biggest mine, bigger than Midnight. These people that had been flying, they picked up this anomaly on this Spokane Indian Reservation. And then they came to see us and tried to determine what it meant. Well, we went out looking with them, and we examined it on the ground, and it didn't look too red hot, but we suggested that they put a few trenches down, which they did. And they h it some low carbonaceous seams which were radioactive, and these were where the anomaly was coming from. And as a result of this, why, they began a drilling program and it was financed by the government on a D.M.E.A.
loan. We don't administer the D.M.E.A. loans, but we usually participate in recommending or denying the
12

 DONALD HITLAND # 1
loans which we recommended. And as I say, this later developed into--it now has the largest reserves of any mine in the Northwest called the Peter's Lease. But outside of that, I don't think we had much success with any other projects. Lots of little occurrences, some of them looked encouraging, some looked real encouraging. You actually can pick up
some of the samples with good looking uranium mineralization, but the environment j ust--you see, you have several criteria of what makes a uranium deposit. But if just one of those dumb things is missing, why, you just don't have it.
RG: Of all the western states it seems the Colorado Plateau is by far the--
DH: It is the largest, right. And you got to remember that the Grants Mineral Belt down there is also on the plateau. And that area is just getting bigger and bigger all the time. It's the granddaddy of them all. Some of it's getting quite deep, much deeper than we'd ever anticipated and [deeper than] people would be willing to drill to look for uranium. I'd say three years ago if you talked much over a thousand feet of drilling, people would laugh at you. They'd say it was not economical. They're drilling four
thousand feet down there, and it 1oaks 1ike it ' s 13

 DONALD HITLAND #1
going to be economical at eight dollars a pound. But to do this you've got to have an exceptionally tight deposit. You've got to have high-grade, thick, large tonnage deposit; by tonnage I mean over a million tons.
What is the qualities of the ore in this area near
GB:
DH: GB: DH: GB: DH:
Grants, New Mexico?
What is the quality, you mean--?
What percentage of ore does it run?
Oh, you mean in general?
Un huh.
Oh, twenty-five hundredths; five pounds per ton. By tons is usually the way you determine ore. Now this is the average. There are some that run up to twelve pounds. Some they can actually mine down as much as maybe three, three pounds per ton. But to do this it's got to be an almost open pit, shallow, open pit, easily milled to take a deposit like that. I don't know what the cutoff is now. See, they've probably mined forty, fifty million pounds already. They probably have got that much ore from the ground. These are published figures, but like I say it varies. I'd say three to twelve pounds is what they'll range from and probably average five.
GB: What about the future of the uranium deposits on the 14

 DONALD HITLAND # 1
Colorado Plateau, how does it look?
DH: Well, some of the areas are being exhausted or have almost been exhausted already. Like you take White Canyon down in southern Utah, Monument Valley, they still carry some potential in the area, but the big easily accessible deposits, they look like they are about gone. Now Lisbon Valley where Steen's deposit was, certainly in the environment of those deposits when Steen's deposit occurred, it looks like they're
about gone. However, there is some at a much greater depth on a down faulted block east of his deposit, and there's still some potential there. The Grants Mineral Belt looks really good there yet. We don't really see the limits. In other words, it's about eighty miles long, this mineralized trend is about ten miles wide. That looks like it's going both laterally--both ways. In other words, in between along in this eighty-mile stretch we have little gaps, say, in the Grants Minerals and the Mount Taylor volcanics. This is where we used to think it was too deep--four thousand, four to five thousand feet. They're finding it in there. They're extending it out to the west in the Gal1up area and they're going to the east in the Rio Puerco area. So I don't see any--we haven't reached the 1imits on it. We
15

 DONALD HITLAND #1
don't know how much is there.
RG: Well, the down fault you were talking about, near the ---?---, will that be economically feasible to mine?
DH:
It looks like it because Rio Algom has recently built out an ore body there and they are sinking a twenty- five-hundred-foot shaft. In fact, they're about down to it on this deposit of theirs, and this just covers a small segment of what we think the potential mineralized belt is. We think there are other ones along this.
I have no further questions, do you?
I don't either. Thank you very much, Mr. Hitland. Thank you.
