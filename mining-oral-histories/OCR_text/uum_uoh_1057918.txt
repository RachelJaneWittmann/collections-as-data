 THIS IS MITCH HADDAD INTERVIEWING MR. ROBERT PRUITT IN HIS OFFICE IN THE CONTINENTAL BANK BUILDING ON JULY 30, 1970 FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH AND CALIFORNIA ST A TE COLLEGE AT FULLERTON URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT.
MH: The first thing I'd like to know is a little bit about yourself, please.
RP: My name is Robert G. Pruitt, Jr. I am forty years old. I am a graduate of the College of Law of the University of Utah. I also hold degrees in geology from Emory University in A tlanta, Georgia; a bachelor's and a master's degree. I worked as a geologist for about eight and a half or nine years in various capacities before I went to law school. I graduated from law school in 1961. I have been engaged in a specialized practice of law since the day I graduated from law school. This specialization principally has been natural resources law--mining, oil and gas work. Immediately upon graduation from law school, I went to work for the law firm of Senior and Senior. It was a first that had at that time a fantastic reputation in mineral law. I worked there for about three and a half years. Following the death of Clair Senior, the senior partner and the man who had really made the law firm work, I came here. Prior to going to law school and upon graduation from Emory
University as a geologist, I went to work for the Atomic Energy Commission as a geologist in

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
reconnaissance work. I did not work in the Colorado Plateau, however. I worked in the Northwestern United States. I was stationed primarily in Butte, Montana.
I also covered the states of Wyoming, Montana, Idaho Washington, Oregon, northern California, and in occasional parts of Nevada. The office I worked for also covered Utah outside of the Colorado Plateau. But because we had an office in Salt Lake City, which I was not attached to, I didn't do any work at all in Utah. I also served a hitch in the army, in which I was primarily concerned with military intelligence. I was an aerial photo interpreter. That was during the Korean conflict. I didn't see any action. Then upon leaving the Atomic Energy Commission in October of 1956, I transferred immediately to the U.S. Department of the Interior. There I was attached to the Bureau of Land Management, but I shifted from being a geologist to working as an adjudicator in the BLM Land Office. I went to the land office to replace an attorney who had left the employment of the landá
office, and so I was given his duties which were essentially legal duties. My boss, who was an attorney, a woman, was given a promotion to the solicitor's office. So within about a month or two after I came into the land office, I found myself in
2

 ROBER T G . P R U I T T # 1
charge of the adjudication section of the land office. I was doi ng ever yt hing. I was issuing patents, oil and gas leases, coal leases, titles to virtually anything that had to do with minerals. I also administered the contests against mining claims that previously I had instituted as a geologi st f or the BLM. That was more than I could handle. I was going to law school virtually full time, working virtually full time and fast burning myself out. So I talked them into hiring someone to be my boss. They hired an attorney, and I trained him to do the
specialized type of work involved. Then I went back principally to adjudicating mineral leases and mining claim patents. That was virtually what I did all the way through law school. Immediately upon taking the bar exam I left the BLM and went with Senior and Senior. So that's the nature of my very specialized background, but one that I've enjoyed. I feel that it qualifies me in an unusual way to do the kind of work that I do.
MH: You bring an interesting question now. Leaving out your position as a lawyer right now, if you can recollect back, could you explain to me a little bit of the--you stated you were a geologist both for the
Atomic Energy Commission, a geologist for the Bureau 3

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
of Land Management, and also working under the Department of the Interior. Here are three areas of governmental control which are prime to mining law.
Y es.
Were you with the AEC then during the uranium boom? Yes. Early 1952 to 1956.
Even though you weren't in the Colorado Plateau, could you relate to me what the government policy was
RP: MH: RP: MH:
RP:
in regards to control of the uranium industry?
Well, I was doing reconnaissance and exploration work. I was completely unattached to any activities
involving regulation. In fact, to my knowledge, the AEC didn't have very much in the way of regulation of the industry. They did, I know, but I don't know what it was. My work was to encourage people, prospectors, to find uranium. Primarily my duties were to go around with the very sophisticated radiation detection devices of the day, the first scintillometers, for instance, and try to examine old mining properties, either abandoned or operating properties, in the hope of detecting heretofore
undetected radioactivity. We would go to properties. If we could get underground, we would go underground and take a tour of the mine with the owner usually with our equipment turned on full blast, and anything
4

 ROBERT G. PRUI TT #1
we detected, we would investigate. We'd write complete reports on all t he properties. We
investigated every type of mine or quarry I ever heard of. If the properties were closed, either abandoned or idle, we would examine everything that was available. We would examine the dumps, the available workings, the shafts, the air outlets, and tried to detect radon gas which would be present if there was any uranium. We found quite a bit of radioactivity. We found a hell of a rich uranium deposit in the Sunshine, a mine in the Kellogg District of northern Idaho, which was a silver mine. It was a pure uraninite, a pitchblende, very high grade. To my knowledge it has never been mined. The company was just not interested in uranium. This was at a time when the major mining companies, the established old line mining companies, looked upon the uranium boom as some kind of a fraud. They didn't take it seriously. Anaconda was the first company to change its opinion and it must have been seven or eight years in getting around to it. They discovered the big deposit down at Grants, New Mexico. That put them in the uranium business in a big way. Most of the big mining companies never treated uranium as a true mining operation. They didn't take any interest
5

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1 in it.
MH: You actually were an encourager.
RP: Oh yes. The government had a program, a very liberal
program at the time, of prospector assistance. People would send us samples from all over. We would give them a very careful inspection, assays, and written reports on the samples. If the samples showed any merit, we would make a trip and visit the property to make a report for them.
MH: You actually log their holes for them too?
RP: Absolutely. We'd drill their holes for them! The
government had a tremendous program. The AEC had one, and then the DMEA had another where they would lend assistance. In the AEC, they would actually put up all of the money. We were located in Butte, Montana. Previously the office had been in Spokane, Washington. They hadn't found anything. Then they discovered some uranium deposits in the Boulder batholith in Montana. So we had an immense program of drilling on some mining claims in the Boulder area. I am positive that the government spent far more money than the mines produced in the uranium, just in the
drilling program along, not counting the surveying we did. We also put up a lot of money for tunneling and drifting. It was a real government subsidized program
6

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
for the right people. We found a bundle of thorium, but we didn't find too much uranium. In fact, one of the biggest discoveries of uranium in the area happened right outside of Spokane within sight, practically, of the former AEC office. This discovery occurred years after that office had been moved because they couldn't find anything. The discovery was at Spokane. They found autenite deposits, and they were very rich deposits. I think they have been reactivated and are being mined again today. They were quite good deposits.
MH: As you moved into the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of the Interior, here's another area where the attitude was again important.
RP: You get an entirely different attitude.
MH: Right. Yes, you also get to the whole idea of
importance of patenting a mining claim.
RP: Well, the Bureau of Land Management administered certain regulations, but it really didn't regulate the mining industry. It was the organization through which certain government procedures had to be processed. The Bureau of Land Management had an entirely different view. The AEC was almost like
working for private industry. The Bureau of Land Management was like working for some horribly
7

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
bureaucratic organization. I can give you a little capsule summary. The BLM was formed in 1946 when the grazing service which was form in the early 1930s merged with the general land office which was formed
in the 1830s. The general land office had a certain attitude and outlook about it. It was a land disposer. In other words, its job was to regulate the disposal of the public lands. All the patents were issued through the Land Office.
MH: Under the section of the Constitution which states that the federal government may do with the public lands as it sees fit?
RP: Well, the Congress. The Congress delegated it to the president, and he delegated it to the secretary of the interior. The land office was the organization which actually processed all these things. So it was essentially an administerial body which made sure that whenever anybody applied to the government for a patent, they had done all the things necessary to deserve it. That's frankly the way most land or most titles to federal land were acquired, through earning them rather than purchase. In other words, the guy with the most money didn't necessarily get the land. The Homestead Act, for instance, provided land sales at a nominal price to a fellow who earned the right
8

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
to take the patent by living on the land and by cultivating it. If you didn't live on it and cultivate it, no amount of money could buy any land under the Homestead Act. The mining claim law was the same way. You earned a mining claim by going out,
finding a valuable mineral deposit, carrying it to a certain stage of development, and then purchasing it from the federal government for a very nominal price. This is kind of the legal doctrine of pedis possessio in a way, isn't it?
otherwise wild and inhospitable federal public domain. Most of the policies, I'm sure, were arrived at during the period when the government was anxious to have its land settled by Americans, as opposed to Spaniards or Indians or Canadians or British or French or whoever. It was a liberal policy, no question about it. Of course, it's changed over the years. Now it's highly restrictive. We are almost seeing the other side of the coin. The grazing service was formed pursuant to the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. Its job was to regulate the heretofore unregulated use of the surface of the public domain
MH:
RP:
MH:
RP: It was intended to encourage the settlement of the
Yes it is.
A ctually being on there?
9

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
before 1930, people could go out, cut timber and report to no one. People would graze their livestock and fight like hell with each other over who could
ágraze around a certain water hole. The grazing service was set up some kind of an orderly procedure for regulating this, so that the farmers didn't shoot it out with each other, and the cattlemen would have certain little areas that would be their little domain to graze cattle. It's a tragic state of affairs, but it appears that the general land office was completely merged into and dominated by the grazing service. All of the BLM state directors, most of the BLM directors in Washington D. C. , virtually all of your really key personnel within the BLM were g r a z i n g s e r v i c e p e o p l e . A nd t h e y j u s t d i d n ' t
understand the philosophy of disposal that characterized the general land office, and have over the years thwarted that policy. I myself have a strong loyalty toward the old land office. I liked their outlook. It was reasonable. They sat as judges. If you had met the law, the land was yours. If you hadn't met the law, come back and try again some time later. To the grazing people, it didn't make any difference whether you had complied with the law or not. They weren't going to give the land up. And
10

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
that's the attitude that you find today in people setting policy within the BLM. There's a new generation coming into being. They're neither land office people nor grazing service people. But when I was working with the BLM, there were still a few of
the old types around. There are still a few of the old types around. It didn't take me very long to identify which type they were. My sympathies lay with the Land Office people. I did not have any sympathy with the grazing service people. They are just not my type of people. They were the government bureaucrat types that everybody mutters about. The land office people were for the most part the noble loyal government clerks that everybody likes to think all government are. The kind we don't have any more of. Maybe you couldn't agree with them because they were funny looking little people, wheezing for the most part, dedicated to their job. Many of them had been on the job thirty, thirty-five years. But they were experts. They really knew what they were doing and they did not play God. Or tried 'not to. Maybe a few of them did.
MH: This was primarily an adjudication?
RP: Yes, that's right. They sat like judges and most of
them were glorified clerks of some form or another. 11

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
But that's what they were. Today, of course, you've got the people going through various government training programs. There seem to be a policy within the BLM where they just will not touch a prospective employee who has any background whatsoever in the mining or the oil and gas industry. They never hire anybody away from the oil companies or the mining companies to go to work for the government. The contrary does not hold true in the grazing service. They'll hire people away from farms and ranches and everything else. You get these people who are thoroughly indoctrinated with the "preserve our
surface" and "what the heck's a mineral" attitude! So it's a frustration to the mining and oil and gas industry to deal with people like this because they are basically very unsympathetic. That's doesn't mean that they can't educate themselves. Many of them do. and there are in the BLM some very intelligent people. But here again the federal government does
not encourage intelligence.
MH: This point you made of attitude. You were talking
about your sympathies with the land office. This brings to mind the first of the legal questions I have. This is over the granting of the patent.
RP: Y es?
12

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
MH: This is a definite legal problem to mining, and is
RP: MH:
RP: MH:
RP:
MH:
something which to miners is often very important. Now the impression you gave first of the old land office people is that they'd follow the law as written, correct?
Yes.
From what I understand it was written to aid the little individual miner.
That's right.
I mean you file your application for patent and eventually you pay, what, five dollars an acre, isn't it?
Two dollars and fifty cents an acre for placer claims and five dollars an acre for lode claims.
Then if you've met specifications, then you eventually get your land. Then I've been told it kind of capsulized in this Coleman versus the United States, wasn't it? They applied the marketability test now to a patent, making it almost impossible to get one?
No, not really.
Or hard to get one?
Not really. The test has never been different. The test has always been that there must be a valuable mineral deposit. The question is, how do you
RP: MH: RP:
13

 ROBER T G . P R U I T T # 1
demonstrate such a thing? Back in the very, very old days--we're talking about 1870 and 1880--if you were crazy enough to spend five hundred dollars per mining claim in improvements, if you had in fact found minerals, if you were further willing to go ahead and pay for the costs of a mineral survey, which is a very expensive type of a survey, and if you were then ready to pay the government five dollars an acre, why, there must be a valuable mineral deposit. People didn't spend that kind of money back in those days if there was not a valuable mineral deposit. You've got to recognize that you can do anything in the way of mining operations on an unpatented mining claim that you can do with a patented mining claim. There's no distinction. In fact, a patent is not the granting of a title, it is confirming the title you already have when you first located the mining claim.
MH: Sort of a fee title?
RP: No, you¥ve got a fee title, but it's a conditional
fee title. The patent makes it unconditional. It removes all doubt as to whether the conditions have been met. Because in the process of the adjudication of the patent, granting of the patent, all of the conditions are met.
MH: The hearings and the-- 14

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
RP: Well, if there's a dispute as to some requirement,
there's a hearing. If there ' s no dispute, there's no hearing. Even today. You give me the right circumstances and I can get you a mining patent within six months. It's no problem at all. But you've got to have the right circumstances. These circumstances are very hard to meet. It virtually requires producing a profitable mine.
MH: Of a mineral which is marketable at that time, right? RP: Well, yes. You can't operate a mine on a paying basis if no one is buying the mineral, or if the mineral is being bought for a price less than it's costing you
to produce it.
MH: It also can't be a projection mineral?
RP: Oh, no. It's got to be a present thing because who
knows what the future holds. I don't disagree with that theory frankly. The tragic part about it is that a mining claim is subjected to attack at anytime. It's not just when you voluntarily go and apply for patent. I mean it ' s 1ike you were expected to be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, an acceptable student. Well, what would happen if they caught you at three o'clock in the morning in bed asleep. And held you to that same standard? You couldn't meet it, could you?
And yet somebody says, "All right, today you've got 15

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
to be a good student, you're going to go in and meet the dean. Put on your bushy tail and your bright eyes and go in there." You can do that. But it's this business of waking you up in the middle of the night and subjecting you to a surprise attack. That's what hurts. It's the same thing with a mining claim. You're expected to have a discovery and a paying mine the first day you walk on the property. To the extent that you're lucky and you're give any grace period, you're expected to have it maybe the second day, or the third day, or the fourth day. But there's no grace period. When they attack mining claim, you haven't any time. It's an all or nothing proposition. The forest service, for example, has a terribly
vicious policy. They'11 follow the locator around. They'11 actually detail a man in a truck to drive around behind him. When he starts tacking his location notice on a tree, they'11 file a contest complaint against him. There's no way in the world he can meet their test unless somehow or another he's appropriating somebody else's already producing mine. You can see that an administration that's that vicious, there is no hope of anybody ever complying with it. Of course, the forest service doesn't want you to comply. The whole purpose of the forest
16

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
service is to get mining claims off of the national forests because mining claims constitute a conflict of management. It's as if somebody wants to locate a mining claim in my front yard or my house and dig up
MH: RP:
all my shrubs in my yard. I'm not in sympathy with that. I've nothing to gain and everything to lose. I'11 engage in any strategy I can to keep those people out of my front yard. The forest service has exactly the same attitude, as if it was their front yard. And there's quite a bit of justification for that.
But quite a bit of conflict then, too.
Oh, good night, yes. The conflict is getting very intense. You can say what you will about the forest service. They are basically a very generous and good outfit to work with on their terms. Man, you ever try to impose your terms on them, and you'11 find out what a tough bunch of guys they are.
So sometimes it's coming down to individual versus the government at times?
The individual hasn't got a chance! He never has!
Now to get into the question of mining law itself. Now basically the mining which is in effect is one that has been in effect since 1872?
It's been amended numerous times.
MH:
RP:
MH:
RP:
17

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
MH: But it's basically still the same law?
RP: Well, no.
MH: Okay.
RP: Basically, but the original laws were enacted in
1866, substantially amended in 1872, and then just nibbled to death since then. The most recent amendment to the mining laws, I believe, was 1960. Maybe there has even been some since then. There have been voluminous court decisions which have interpreted the mining law. Most of the amendments of the mining laws has not been statutory. It has been interpretive, either by courts or by the administration, mainly the Department of the Interior.
MH: My question then is basically the administration of the mining law. You state this has been amended.
RP: Oh yes.
MH: This shows that it is important that it be
administered right. What is probably right now the most pressing problem in regard to mining law, legally?
RP: The most pressing problem? W ell--
MR: What's the biggest frustration you face, for example,
when you take on mining law cases?
RP: I would say offhand that review of the administrative
18

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
decisions is the biggest problem right now. There is no effective review. When some rancher-turned- government bureaucrat takes offense at the fact that you're locating mining claims in an area where
somebody he knows is grazing his cows, and he goes through the proper procedures, you have a very ineffective way of defending yourself. This man speaks with all the power and magistery of the federal government. You speak with no more power and magistery than you can muster as an individual. Now if you're a big mining company, that's quite a lot of power and magistry. But if you're an individual prospector, that's not very much. You've almost got to be as big as the federal government to fight them on their own terms. There are damned few industries that are that big. Most of the groups that could form together if they wanted to, haven't done so. There is not the coordination within industry groups that a lot of people like to attribute to these groups.
MH: Laws were originally--the statutes were originally passed to protect the individual small miner. For example, in your dealings with the government, some of your whole processes were to help that individual miner to promote exploitation of valuable mineral resources. Now the whole thing is shifting over. The
19

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
small miners almost doesn't stand a chance.
RP: Well, that's been more than just law. Economics has been a big factor. It costs a lot of money to make a mine, as we say in the business, to build a mine. A mine's like a factory. It's a hole in the ground admittedly, but it costs a lot of money to dig a hole
in the ground. It costs more money to dig a hole in the ground than it does to raise a brick structure, for instance. It's just beyond the average individual's means to do the things necessary to make a mine. As a result individuals tend to get classified as speculators. I don't use that terms in a derogatory sense because somebody's got to start everything. Industry is just as bureaucratic ridden as government. More so, in some cases. The inertia of things in general is just staggering to anybody who ever tries to get anything done. It's just amazing. it's almost 1ike a conspiracy to stop progress. So somebody has to get something going. Usually this boils down to some individual somewhere. Whether he happens to be the president of a mining company or some grizzled prospector out in the hills. I've lost
my train of thought.
MH: You got the grizzled prospector out in the hills.
RP: I was trying to make a point before that and it
20

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
slipped me. Well, pass on to something else!
MH: As a lawyer you've seen both cases dealing with large companies versus the federal government, and also small individual persons or individual mining associations versus companies. Larger people, 1ike Charlie Steen and people like that, they could probably even go against the federal government.
RP: Well, the government's impressed by size. There's no question about it. The bigger you are, the more they take you very seriously.
MH: Then we get to the question of policy. It's both legal and economic as well. This is the cause of a lot of litigation. Why did your anti-trust cases come about? Why would a government favor so much the large companies rather than the whole block of smaller miners?
RP: Well, like the Indian say, the government speaks out of both sides of his mouth, or with a forked tongue, or something to that effect. There is no such thing as the government. Y ou're dealing with the departments of government, the branches, or agencies, or individuals, and they change from time to time. The philosophies within any little group will change. I maintain that if Karl Marx or Francisco Franco were
to become president of this United States, it would 21

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
take thirty years to change what's going on here. The reason that it would take thirty years is because it would necessitate people in office being retired out of office. Some guy like yourself, a young fe.llow going to work for the government, he's got a tenure
in the government for thirty years. At the end of thirty years he retires, and he's gone. It takes thirty years to clean out the people that are in there, to get them out, regardless of what the philosophy is up on top. It just doesn't come down. It's like an impervious roof. It's a fourth branch of government, and it's been called bureaucracy. It's neither legislative, executive, nor judicial--it's just bureaucratic! Pure and simple. It's what runs the part of the government that I work with.
MH: You're under the auspices of the courts?
RP: It's a nameless, headless monster you're fighting. If you cut off one head, three will spring out. If you had the president of the United States on your side,
it wouldn't help. The fact of the matter is, the guy would probably get impeached as a result because the bureaucracy is stronger than he is. Witness the fact that if anybody tried to do anything that the bureaucracy doesn't collectively favor, they crucify the guy. These are trends and momentums going through
22

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
government. It's like the trend in unionism, the trend in nationalism or something like that. It just has to work itself out. There's no way to stop it. Hopefully you can stem it, but t here's no way t o stop
it.
MH: When you're dealing with a mining law case today,
what are you primarily dealing with when you're facing this headless monster, as you call it.
RP: That's right. I've learned, I've been indoctrinated, I've learned that in dealing with the Bureau of Land Management, for instance, you're out of your ever loving mind to fight them. You have to become adept at playing the other guy's game and beating him with his own rules.
MH: How do the attorneys actually beat the Bureau of Land Management?
RP: Well, the government's not at all smart. It's not consistent. It's vulnerable. The rules are whatever the rules are. If you can find a light rule, you can cram something through. And there's a rule that says most anything. Really. I have a policy that I've developed. I believe in it and utilize it when I can. There are two ways to get things done, they're alternate ways. I very much favor one over the other.
One is to accomplish what you can at what I call a 23

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
working level, the lowest working level. This is where you're dealing with people who have the initial say-so on the working level, not his boss or his superior, but the actual man in the field. This
farmer-turned-government worker is an ideal example. Or the engineer you have to work with, or the clerk who's the adjudicator. I'm not talking about a land office manager or state director. I'm working way below that level. If you could get approval at that stage, you've really got to have an unusual case that approval will probably not flow as a consequence as it goes up on review. In other words, if the decision
is made down here, the likelihood is that the next superior will not overrule that decision. Nor his boss overrule him. Nor him him. So on up the line.
MH: It's similar to one judge not overruling another judge.
RP: That's right. In other words, once a decisions is made, the tendency is to stand behind the man below. If you get a favorable decision, you've got it made. Unless you get somebody in the chain of command who is on the lookout for you. That happens occasionally. But if you run into the least bit of opposition at the bottom level, you don't go to the next superior or the next guy. You go right to the top, and work
24

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
down. You go to the secretary's office in the case of
MH:
W ashington, and you work
so that somebody in the
office will call this guy on the phone, and say in effect, "What in the hell are you trying to do out there in Utah?" At which this point the opposition will evaporate because his attitude is, "My God, I don't want to lose my job over this silly thing!" At that point, he'11 tend to give his okay. Then you very gingerly go up the path for approval.
In many ways mining law is kind of a game of cops and robbers, almost.
the BLM, the secretary of t he interior ' s
office in to work i t i nterior ' s
RP: It's called playing politics, but it's a peculiar kind of politics. It's not the kind of politics you would play with the county commissioner or the city commissioner or anyone like that. It's a peculiar kind of internal bureaucratic politics.
MH: As a mining law expert, it's one that's really riddled with technology, or riddled with small little legal--it is, isn't it?
RP: Absolutely. It's like you have to play one end of it to get anywhere, yet you're legally bound by so many rules, regulations, federal, state statutes. I mean, you have a whole section of Utah antiquated codes
25
down . And you t ry secretary of the

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
that deal with mining law.
RP: Y ou're getting the picture!
MH: You've got your Sherman Anti-Trust acts, you've got
your land acts, you've got your historical acts, even
back that they can relate to. RP: Sure.
MH: So how do you get around all that?
RP: Well, it's just like you navigate through the rocks
in a river. You just do it. Some guys make it and some guys don't. And those who don't usually try again until eventually they learn the way.
MH: I mean what are some of the biggest problems that face attorneys handling cases?
RP: Oh, the biggest problem I encounter is personal prejudice. People who are mad at something and you happen to represent that something, so they're mad at you.
MH: You mean the whole idea of pressure groups and causes and all this.
RP: Yes, for instance, I think the environmentalists are very quickly making themselves undesired persons around government offices. There was a time if you went in representing a mining company, you felt a hostility in the air, because mining groups, industry groups were disfavored. Well, there has been such an
26

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
overworking of this environmentalist notion that nowadays when you go in representing industry, the government people take you aside and say, "Look, we're basically in favor of what you're trying to do, but let's do it in such a way that it doesn't cause these environmentalist to come in here and raise hell with us."
MH: Because of the big thing with ecology now?
RP: That's right. Well, of course, I'm in favor of that.
Everybody is.
RP: We all have to live. I tend to think maybe I'm not in
favor of preservation but conservation. There's a difference I hope you recognize. A preservationist doesn't ever want to change a thing. A conservationist wants to make the best use out of something. You got two guys and they want to do something with a piece of land: one the conservationists favors and one he doesn't. The preservationist wouldn't favor either. His attitude is, "Look, I like it the way it is. Let's don't ever change it."
MH: Like the isolationists of history?
RP: Yes. It's a head-in-the-sand type of attitude because
in a country like the United States you can afford the luxury of preserving a few historical monuments
27

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
or a few pristine areas, but you just can't stop the forward motion of this country. It just can't be done. You can't push it back either.
MH: Then we get into the question of the momentum of the mining industry. It's something which has been a part of our country, our country's economy, and also our country's legal system since the very first.
RP: Yes, don't look at mining any different than farming because a miner is a rock farmer. He is a fellow who makes his living out of a natural resource, like a fisherman catches fish and a farmer farms wheat or grain, or a lumberman cuts trees, or whatever any of these people in natural resources do. A miner or an oil man simply seeks for and extracts natural resources. In the case of minerals it's a non- renewable natural resource, so that poses a few ethical problems. It just fluctuates like mad. It's unbelievable how the markets in minerals fluctuate. There is precious little control over it because most people are users and not producers, and so they tend to favor wherever they can get the product at the least price. Minerals occur anywhere. They don't necessarily all occur within the geographic boundary of the United States. Very often raw minerals or
metals can be hauled from distant parts of the world
28

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
and sold in the American market at a fantastic economic advantage to what the same product could be mined and sold for in this country, given the
identical deposits. The cost of hauling within the country is much greater than it is from overseas, and the cost of labor in this country if extremely high. The overhead in a mining operation is something that flabbergasts most people. They don't have any notion of it. There is hardly any counterpart in a foreign country to the executive clerical staff that must be supported by an American company. The bookkeeping that has been forced on this nation by the Internal Revenue acts is something that exists very few places in the world.
MH: This again goes back to administrative policies again then that can control the whole aspect.
RP: .Yes, the whole West was developed in a mineral sense because there was encouragement to come here. The land was considered free. It wasn't free, but it was considered free. It's what people think and not what the facts are that count. It was essentially a raw, undeveloped, unexplored area. The topography was such that the ore deposits had a chance of being discovered from the surface. This wasn't true in the eastern United States. You have soil covering most of
29

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
the ground. You don't out here. As a result, the likelihood of finding an outcropping deposit of ore back East was much less than the chance of finding one out West because in the East it would be covered by leaves and dirt and trees. Out west it's probably on the side of a cliff and you could see it for twenty miles! That was an encouragement. Also it's a historical fact throughout the history of the world that development of minerals usually precedes other
forms of development. In other words, the initial development is almost always extractive in form. Wildlife hunting, metals, fuels--wood being a fuel. Later comes farming, later comes industry, later comes urbanization. If there are natural resources, the extractive natural resource operation is usually one of the earliest things to do. In the case out West it was beavers. They extracted the beavers for their skins. And then later on they extracted the gold and the silver. Certain types of minerals are usually only extracted when in proximity to
population centers. Sand and gravel would be an example. There was no sand and gravel business at all in Alaska. Not until they started this big business in Los Angeles--
MR: Yes.
30

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
RP: The economy of this country is such that we just
consume more and more fuel. And of course, fuel is
non-renewable and it is expended.
MH: Fuel can oftentimes be considered as uranium, too,
though.
RP: Uranium is a fuel. That's probably all it's worth,
other than making bombs.
MH: This is a legal point. This is the idea exactly of
whether or not uranium is considered to be
metalliferous or non-metalliferous.
RP: It has been determined to be metalliferous as far as
the classification of metalliferous/non-
metalliferous. It's also a fuel.
MH: Geologically it's not the same as a hardrock mineral
type?
RP: No, geologically it's definitely not. But
geologically it's also not definitely a placer. You realize the metalliferous and non-metalliferous is one type of determination. Placer and lode is another. Gold is very definitely a metal, but it can form as either lode or placer. Fact of the matter is that the historic lodes and the historic placers were gold placers, gold lodes.
MH: Going back into the geological periods, right?
RP: Well, going back to the form of occurrence, lode and
31

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
placer distinction has to do with the form of occurrence. It has nothing to do with the type of mineral; metalliferous and non-metalliferous focus has to do with the characteristic qualities of the mineral. How in the world can gypsum ever be metalliferous? It doesn't have a metal in it. It has the metal calcium in it, but calcium is a sort of
non-metal metal. Chemically it is a plus type ion, but it's not a metal. By the same token, how in the world can you ever have lead (galena) as being non- metalliferous? It is essentially all mineral. It has got sulphur in it, but it's essentially all metalliferous. So when you say that uranium has been determined to be metalliferous, it's really more akin to non-metalliferous. I say to myself, uranium is probably definitely non-metalliferous, but it is treated as a lode type deposit, recognizing that lode has nothing to do with metal. Most lodes are metals, but many things which are lode deposits are not
metals.
MH: Then isn't that kind of a frustration in the courts
considering the fact that it is dealt with as a
metalliferous type element?
RP: What you're doing is you're blending several outlooks
of what you're working with. Sometimes a court wants 32

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
to favor one outlook over another. This leads to some very confusing pronouncements by the courts.
MH: You can come to a claiming problem. How to claim a uranium claim? Whether it is a lode or is to be claimed as a placer. They allowed it both ways, didn't they?
RP:
MH: RP: MH: RP: MH: RP:
No, both ways were used, but whenever they came into conflict, the preponderance of decisions was to favor with the lode claim. Do you know the philosophy behind that?
Why they favored the lode claim?
Yes. It's smaller.
Fifteen hundred by six hundred, right? Yes
A placer takes up a larger area?
An individual placer claim is only 20 acres. An
individual lode claim is 20.66 acres. So really a lode claim can be bigger than an individual's placer claim. Most people locate association placer claims which usually run up to the maximum, which is a 160 acres. On each claim you only have to have one discovery. You only have to do one year's assessment work which happens to be a hundred dollars worth of work. It's possible to locate more ground, hold more ground cheaply and with less effort under an
33

 ROBER T G . P R U I T T # 1
association placer claim than it would be under a lode claim. When the courts ran into this problem, they tended to favor the guy who was getting the least. In other words, who was working the hardest to hold onto this same piece of ground.
MH: So they started favoring lode claims then?
RP: Plus the fact that most uranium does occur in a lode form. It does not occur in the placer form. I think frankly the decisions were purely legal. The courts looked to the type of deposit and saw that almost always the uranium occurred in rock in place. Rock in place is a lode form regardless of whether it's a bed, a vein, or a fissure. I'm sure an underlying philosophy under all these decisions was that the lode claim lends itself to less abuse than the placer claim. It requires more monumentation. It takes in
less area. It requires more work, more discovery, more everything. If you're going to decide a hard case between two hard-working individuals, you'd probably going to decide in favor of the hardest working one of the two.
MH: Here we go on your conflict of claims, and the overlapping of claims. Now this is a big problem, isn't it?
RP: Your boundaries on the mining claims may mean nothing
34

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
as far as the area covered by the mining claim. This is confusing. Most people are brought up in a subdivided neighborhood where a lot line is a boundary line. You look at a mining claim and it
looks very much like a lot. But it's not.
MH: So the actual apex of a mining claim is really very
vague?
RP: Yes, if you're talking about extralateral rights,
you're talking about an entirely different problem. But the boundary lines of a mining claim are not necessarily the sidelines and the end lines. They are the lines which, if you knew the conflicts within the claim, you would draw around the area that did not have any conflicts.
MH: You mentioned extralateral rights. Now this is another question.
RP: The first case I ever had after I graduated from law school was a very complicated extralateral rights case. I would have been willing to bet you everything I owned that I would never see one in my career. Yet it was the first case I ever worked on. Extralateral rights is a very valuable right under very peculiar circumstance. It is a right which is almost
meaningless under the circumstances you most commonly encounter. The 1866 law gave [a locator] no right to
35

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
any land area. He merely owned the deposit in the ground. That didn't work because people in this country are used to thinking in terms of parcels of land. So in 1872, Congress tried to blend the two notions together. The government gave the locator a piece of land up to fifteen hundred feet long and up to six hundred feet wide, three hundred feet to either side of the center line of the vein. This gave you, if you had no vein, a rectangle, a six-hundred-
feet wide by fifteen hundred feet long rectangle. They still gave the locator the deposit which apexed within the boundaries of his claim. If that deposit went out beyond the boundaries, the locator still owned it. He could still follow it, under some very restrictive rules. Now because lode deposits were thought of as classically being what geologists call a vein or fissure deposit, that is, a crack in the earth filled with mineral, they were also thought to be running some distance, more or less vertical, across the length of the land. The prospector was supposed to locate mining claims end to end along this vein and three hundred feet either side to the center line of it. That was the way a claim was supposed to be located. It's pretty obvious that if the locator had claims end to end, he couldn't permit
36

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
a location to go past his end lines or he'd be on somebody else's claim. By the same token it's also equally obvious that if the vein pitched out in such a way as to go through a sideline, logically there would be no claim next to his claim because there is no surface vein there unless there are a whole bunch of parallel veins. It's just the most logical thing
in the world to let a locator follow this vein through his sidelines but not through his end lines. Well, of course, unfortunately nature doesn't always make deposits like that. Human beings don't always locate their mining claims exactly like the law says or like nature dictates. The tendency today, for instance, is just to blanket an area with mining claims without any regard at all to where the veins are; thereafter, seek, discover, and hopefully find some veins.
MH: Then you really get into some problems?
RP: Oh boy, you do. I was with a client in the office yesterday. He had some mining claims in a stibnite vein deposit. I'm drawing on my memory here. The vein ran north-south. He had five mining claims, all side by side running east-west. He wanted to apply for patent. I said, "Well, the very first thing you're going to have to do is swing your claims, so that
37

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
your claims run lengthwise and straddle the vein. In the area that you're talking about, you're going to have to give up three claims, There's only room for two claims end to end." He said, "Well, how am I going to get the land on either side?" I said,
"You're not." He couldn't understand it. That's the way the law reads and it's very explicit. When they surveyed those claims for patent, rest assured the mineral surveyor knows the law. This locator would be faced with either swinging his claims or losing all of the land along the length of each of these five claims beyond the three hundred feet from either side of the center line. He'd wind up with little six hundred by six hundred squares end to end.
MH: You made a statement that brings me to a question. And it's one you really can answer. You said you can be rest assured that the mineral surveyor will know the law. In the example you gave the man almost makes the point that a lot of the prospectors are so totally unaware of the law.
RP: Good Lord, yes.
MH: Now is this usually true? Are geologists and mineral
surveyors familiar with the laws they are dealing
with?
RP: Mineral surveyors are, geologists are not. Geologists
38

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
are not only unfamiliar with the law, but they are almost repelled by laws. I have a lot of clients who are geologists. One reason they use me as a lawyer is because they identify the problem as being legal in nature. They don't want to have anyth i ng t o do with
it.
handsomely for this. If they work for a company that's got a lot of money, I make a lot of money out of the case. It's a psychological thing among geologists. Engineers are almost as bad. Engineers tend to want to know the law. They also deep down in their hearts realize that they don't quite understand what they're dealing with and then they need help. Engineers despise lawyers. There's hardly an exception to this. Nobody really likes a lawyer. Nobody really likes a policeman. You need them, but nobody really likes them! Lawyers are the same way. Engineers just despise lawyers. Many engineers will go out of their way never to have anything to do with a lawyer. I am able to play a game because of my background as a geologist. I can wear two hats. When I detected that a client is basically anti-lawyer, I play the part of the geologist. I start using the
So they stick it on you?
MH:
RP: Yes, so they dump it on me. I get paid very
39

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
proper terminology and concepts. Then he says, "My God, what an unusual lawyer I'm dealing with here. He talks 1ike an engineer." Very quickly we make some kind of rapport or communication. All of a sudden, I'm the only lawyer he'll have anything to do with. I'm giving you little secrets of how to practice law
MH:
RP:
from a technical standpoint. It's amazing how it works. It's purely psychological. The average prospector doesn't know anything about mining law. Half of what he thinks he knows, is wrong.
During the uranium boom, weren't there books actually published on how to stake a claim?
Oh, there are today. Almost every state that has mining laws publishes a little pamphlet. I can show you a whole--it's not too appropriate to walk around the room, but let me show you what I'm talking about. See those books?
Yes.
Those are the state mining laws of the various states. I'm in the process of preparing one for the state of Utah.
Like capsule summaries then, more or less?
MH: RP:
MH:
RP: Some of them are. I'll show you two examples. Here's
a little booklet called Nevada mining claim procedures. That's an explanation. A fellow named
40

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1
Gallagher wrote it. He explains in his own terminology what it's all about. Here are the Nevada state mining laws. It's just a compilation of the
statutes. It doesn't explain anything. Now Utah's
mining laws are very, very brief.
MH: They're only one section. Sections Forty through--
what?
RP: Yes, it's very brief. You can practically write them
on the palm of your hand they're so short. They don't give you a full picture al all. The fact of the matter is, if all you were to do was publish the Utah mining laws, you would leave more questions unanswered than you'd answer by far. It would almost be misleading. The thing I'm working on is a combination of procedures with a discussion, plus the statutes themselves included for those people who aren't satisfied until they've got the actual law in their hands.
MH: This is a definite question. The law is something that really isn't understood even though it's been in existence for over 150 years. It's still not really too understood.
RP: It's the height of naivety to assume that anybody knows the law on anything. The average retail merchant doesn't understand the Uniform Commercial
41

 ROBERT G. PRUITT #1 Code at all.
MH: This has caused the whole demand for lawyers?
RP: Well, yes. The average person knows a great deal more about his personal health and hygiene as compared to what a doctor knows than the average person knows about law as opposed to what a lawyer knows. In other words, most of the accidents that would befall you physically, you'd probably know enough to take care of. You might know a few old wives' tales and home remedies that would kill you if you tried them, but
for the most part, most of what you know about first aid and health and hygiene is correct. You might be reluctant to set a bone, but I dare say you know how to do it. The same thing doesn't hold true in law. The average man in the street, whether he be prospector, small merchant, or salesman, doesn't know how to get along. Most of what he knows is not correct. If he relied upon his own advice, he would
make a tragic mistake.
RP: I deal with real estate men all the time. They don't
know a thing about real estate law. Not a bloody thing. It's unbelievable. They make more money than lawyers!
MH: Don't they know where to find out what the law really is?
42

 ROBERT PRUITT #1
RP: It's very easy if anyone wants to look, but no one
wants to look. It's complicated when you look. Most of our laws were written as though there was sort of a game as to who could understand the most law. I have an awful time. I consider myself virtually a layman in most fields of law. I know lots of lawyers who have experienced the same problem. I can't read the law and always understand it. I went through three years of law school, I've been practicing law, and I can't understand it. I'm just lost. The law has gotten to the point to where it's almost
incomprehensible.
MH: That's why you're taking specialized fields?
RP: Oh, yes. It has to be. The lawyer who holds himself
out as a general practitioner in the law business is kidding himself and his clients. It's almost impossible. There are some areas that in my opinion constitute a legitimate general law practice. About 90 percent of the things that come into a lawyer's office require the experience, education, training, and just basic knowledge that to effectively handle
[a particular caseJ only an expert would have. I'm convinced of that. That's a 1i ttle personal philosophy, but I think time will bear me out.
MH: How encompassing are mining laws? Are they technical 43

 ROBERT PRUITT #1
and confusing enough so that it takes a mining law specialist lawyer?
RP: Yes and no. There are all types of problems. The simpler problems can be easily comprehended by anyone who's willing to take the time to read the source material and acquaint himself with the subject. You don't even have to be a lawyer. Most lawyers are too damned busy to sit down and really read. I find it much easier to explain to a layman than to a lawyer because a lawyer hasn't got the time. But a laymen, for the most part, has a consuming passion: this little problem before him. That's his whole life. He doesn't have anything else. He's got the time. He is intelligent in that he can read and can understand things; he can read it as well as you can. I work very much with engineers, geologists, and what I call lay lawyers. By "lay lawyers" I mean people who within this narrow specialized field are very knowledgeable, far more so than any lawyer you can find who is on the street or in an average law office. They have far more knowledge about mining law. But you take them one inch outside of this small area, and they don't know what you're talking about. For instance, a mining lawyer should know a great
deal about a lot of things and a hell of a lot about 44

 ROBERT PRUITT #1
a few things. Well, I have run across these laymen who know a hell of a lot about a few things, but they don't know much else. So it's difficult for them to get the picture.
MH: I guess that brings the aspect of technology into mining law. How is technology and the changing society affected the whole outlook of it, and its application as well?
RP: Well, it's changed drastically. I'm sure that anybody who learned his mining law in the twenties or early thirties would be completely lost if you were to suddenly dump him into the mining laws of the sixties and seventies, even the fifties. The Second World War represents a break in mining law. Before the Second World War, mining law was essentially one type of thing. After the Second World War, it tended to be more or less an entirely different creature. Part of
it was brought about by the fantastic influx into the mining world of non-mining people: school teachers, postmen, people on vacation, bums, and guys who ought to be out hitchhiking and letting their hair grow, turned into prospectors. Guys who today would be hippies and dropouts rushed out to stake and make their fortune in uranium claims. For the most part they wore crew cuts and khakis! It was the uniform of
45

 ROBERT PRUITT #1
the day. But they had no training or knowledge. They had lots of imagination. What the procedures and the custom of the industry or mining district were, they didn't know. They did a lot of very strange things and a lot of very strange problems arose. One thing that happened during the uranium boom, I'm not aware that it ever happened before, was that one individual would locate five or six thousand mining claims in his own name, an unheard of thing in the mining industry. The likelihood that he could raise a hundred dollars worth of assessment work for each of those five thousand claims was just completely illogical. But that didn't stop him. In a place like Utah where you can hold a mining claim up to nearly a full twenty-four months without doing a dime's worth of work, the law.worked in his favor. But hell, they located as many claims and held them just as long in other areas. They'd just file a false affidavit saying they had complied with the laws and then the burden was on you to show that they didn't. For most people it's very difficult to bear this burden.
MH: The government didn't have the time or money?
RP: The government doesn't care. You have got to realize that mining law is really two types of law: one is the law that the federal government is involved in, a
46

 ROBERT PRUITT #1
small part of it; the other part is what I call the private conflicts between two prospectors staking mining claims, trying to get the same deposit. This
is much more common. I would say in a mining law practice, 80 to 85 percent of the work you do involves private conflicts; only 15 to 20 percent involved the government. The government is becoming a bigger factor as they get more intensely involved in these mining claim matters.
MH: Also as large companies take a bigger role in mining, then the government might be called in to control them.
RP: No, The size of the company usually doesn't mean governmental regulations. The government usually stays away from big companies. They won't fight big companies. The big companies can do anything they want to. It's the little prospector that the government goes after.
MH: It seems to me the mining industry on the Colorado Plateau and uranium mining industry is exceptionally void of violence.
RP: It wasn't originally. In the fifties it was something else again.
MH: This is what I was wondering.
RP: The good old days come back to me. If you call the
47

 ROBERT PRUITT #1
good old days when you stood out there with a shotgun and fended off your property.
I was wondering because there was an awful lot of litigation in the courts showing cases from the fifties as well as now. All the way through the whole thing there's a lot of court actions. I really haven't heard of too many killings or anything like you had in California.
Yes, but see, when you say "[like you] had in California," you're talking about a day when everybody carried a gun and there was no such thing as federal marshals. There were no police officers to intervene. The courts were miners' courts. This was back in the days when they hung horse thieves, you know. Violence was just a way of life. It was self- help and vigilante committees. I imagine it virtually took a killing to get a case in the court. Nowadays we're much more litigation minded. Human life is squandered on the highways and various other places, but we treat it as though it's sacred. The purposeful killing of someone over a piece of ground is almost incomprehensible to the average person.
Also the courts were there and well established?
RP: They are now, yes.
MH: But even during the time of the uranium boom, wasn't
MH:
RP:
MH:
48

 ROBERT PRUITT #1 it?
RP: No question about it, yes. You have to realize that most mining claims are out in remote areas. There is a notion in the mining law, one I think that is
logically and legally founded that says if you allow a person to peaceably enter and locate your ground, he might under certain circumstances acquire rights superior to your own; an instance of this being where you don't have a discovery. A man enters peaceably, locates his claim and diligently proceeds to make a discovery. He's got a mining claim and you haven't, even though you were there first. If these facts can all be proved, the question is what constitutes peaceable entry? You can go out here on the street and ask almost anybody. His notion is that peaceable entry means with his tacit consent. If you ask, "How would you prevent peaceable entry?" The idea immediately flashes to almost anybody, "Well, I would bar his way." How better to bar his way than armed? Do you see what I mean?
MH: Yes.
RP: It really isn't that illogical. There is a basis in
the law for this type of activity. If there had been no law at all covering the subject, we probably would have had armed people defending their property. The
49

 ROBERT PRUITT #1
way the law is worded it says if a prospector lets the fellow peaceably enter, under certain circumstances he can oust the prospector from his claim and gain rights superior to the rights the prospector already had. So obviously, a prospector doesn't want to permit anybody to peaceably enter. How better to bar his way than with a gun? Of course,
if you've a gun in your hand, you might use it once in a while. Guns tend to be pretty fatal when used. This time I'll use sort of a facetious example. Had the law said that you should defend your claim with your pick-axe or with a shovel, then you wouldn't have had to kill him necessarily, but you would have had some pretty brutal maulings!
MH: A final question then. This is dealing with modern days, and the pressure groups today. The whole rising trend toward reclamation, ecology, and the environment.
RP: Well, it's competition rather than the pressure groups. Pressure groups have always existed and probably always will. The question is, where will the pressure be exerted? In this instance we have a gradually diminishing federal public domain. You can't locate a mining claim anywhere but on a federal
public domain. You can't locate a mining claim on 50

 ROBERT PRUITT #1
private land or on state land. You can't even locate a claim on a nat i onal park . Certain types of reclamation area have been withdrawn. We have a gradually diminishing area where these laws are applicable. There's only eleven or maybe as high as
thirteen western states where the mining laws are operational to any degree at all. Some of those states have very small amounts of federal public domain land left in them. Utah, Nevada, and Arizona have quite a bit. Anyhow, we have a small total area. Recreation is everywhere. People go fishing, hunting, sightseeing and touring everywhere, whether it's private land, state land, or federal land. The establishment of national parks is pretty well restricted to vacant federal public domain, the very area where the mining claim is operative. Furthermore, hunting and fishing interests are a big
factor in all of this. Private land is gradually being taken out of the hunting and fishing preserve. When I was a kid back in Georgia, private land didn't mean anything. You went fishing wherever there was a stream. You went hunting wherever there was woods.
MH: And nobody cared?
RP: Nobody really cared. Nowadays, you have to climb
fences and avoid search lights, armed guards, and 51

 ROBERT PRUITT #1
everything else in order to go on private land. You'11 wind getting sued or threatened to be sued. Nasty signs that say: "Keep Out,"" No Trespassers,"
"Violators will be shot, questions asked later." It offends you. Everybody knows that you can go on the federal land. You can go on federal land and you can hunt freely. National forests constitute very large areas in the West. They are usually the mountains, woods, streams, and lakes that are the places where you go hunting, fishing and sightseeing. The hunting and fishing people are crowding into these areas out of southern California, for instance, into Utah. So there is a competition there. There's this notion that if you have use of the land it denies me use of land. The old notion of multiple use is a very noble notion, but this doesn't work too well because of the feeling that "it's mine, and not yours." It can't be mine and yours both. This is basic to human nature, I suppose. It certainly is in this country. So we're getting more and more competition for the vacant public domain. It's a well known and practiced now than ever before. If you speak loud enough, make enough noise, exert enough pressure, you'll get your way. It tends to bring out that sort of thing.
Whenever anybody comes into my office and wants to 52

 ROBERT PRUITT #1
accomplish something, I sometimes must tell them there's no way a lawyer can help them. They say,
"Well, what'11 I do?" And I say, "Well, go out and start a riot and burn something down. You'll get your way." It's just a way of life. It's an unfortunate way of life. I hope it will change, or everything will be burned down! But it seems to be a way to accomplish things when other things don't work. Pressure groups are getting more and more vocal, exerting more and more pressure, fighting more and more viciously among themselves. The government winds up being the forum where all these fights are held. So government becomes more and more inured to this type of tactic.
RH: Is there anything else you would like to add in regards to areas we might have missed in mining law that are extremely important? Any issues that have to be brought out?
RP: We've missed an awful lot. I think I can cover a lot of points just quickly by saying that in the case of mining law, the legitimate mining company, the organization or the person capable of actually carrying through a mining venture, is usually treated by the government and by others with a great deal more respect and almost a different set of rules than

is the little individual who optimistically thinks he can go out and make his fortune, digging rocks out of the ground. It's a well known fact that it takes a lot of money, capital, and expenditure to get into the mining business on any kind of a paying basis. The average individual who is no prospector (or who, if he is a. prospector, that's all he is) is never cognizant of that, and he can never quite fathom why people aren't sympathetic with him. A mining claim is for mining. A mining lease is for mining. Nothing else. Not logically. It might be useful for some other things. So if you can't mine it, what right have you got to it? Why should you be permitted to own it? And a prospector is usually a prospector and not a miner. Most miners are not very good prospectors. This is a fact that you tend to lose sight of, but the average prospector goes out, seeks for, and explores a deposit. Having found it, he then tries to sell it to a miner who will then hopefully
mine it and recover the price he's paid for it and probably pay a little royalty to the prospector. Then he goes forward from there. Now the government tends to treat miners and prospectors as the same breed of cat, but still recognizing that prospectors probably do not have the capability of mining. Many miners

don't even have the capability of mining either. Mining is like rock farming. There are a lot of marginal farms. There are a lot of marginal mines. The ecology--you talked about, the environmental bit. Mines have in the past and probably will in the
future have a way of despoiling the surface of the ground. You know, digging a big hole and leaving a pile of dirt. When a mine is mined out, there is precious little incentive for anybody to spend any more money on that piece of ground. It's just like a building that's burned down. Who goes around and sweeps up the ashes? Usually nobody. I think that the
law ought to provide for some means of picking up after the picnic, cleaning up after the mine. Historically, mining ventures go through stages. There's the prospecting stage in which money is spent like water because of this lure of great riches. Then you get into the actual production stage in which money is very carefully spent, but nevertheless spent in large sums. But there every dollar spent has got to logically show a return. In the prospecting stage there isn't even a consideration if you ever analyze these things. Sooner or later every mine is mined to the point where if you spend more dollars, you're not going to earn them back. You get to the point of
55

 ROBERT PRUITT #1
diminishing returns. At that point usually the operation is turned over to what I call a scavenger. For instance, there may be a mine, it is an existing mine and a lot of money has been spent to get it to this stage. But it's not worth money for a big mining company to go further and yet there's ore in the ground. Some small operator who says to himself, "I don't have the big overhead. I don't have the big capital expenditure and I can operate on a smaller scale, I'll take over this operation. I'll make a lot
less money out of it than the big mining company made, but I'll make a lot less money out of it than the big mining company made, but I'11 net about as much. At least I hope I will." Usually that small operator is operating on a shoestring. He's the person in whose hands the property resides at the time it finally goes idle, abandoned. He's the person the conservationists will go to and say, "All right, you rascal. You might not have dug this hole, but we're going to make you fill it up." At which point he's just incapable. You could kill him, you could crucify him, nail his hide to the wall, but he can't afford to fill up that hole. He just doesn't have the resources. So the question is, who is going to do it? Are you going to make the big mining company fill up
56

 ROBERT PRUITT #1
its hole at a time when there's still ore in the ground and some small operator is sitting there pleading with them to turn it over to him? The mine's no good to him if it's filled up. Are you going to do a thing like that? That's wasteful. That's contrary to conservation principles, to get the most out of the ground. My own opinion is that a solution might be to cause a mining company to post some kind of a bond. Then in the event that the mining company is unable or reluctant to come back and fill the hole up after the small operator has completed his work, the bonding company would step in and do it. That's what they got paid the premiums for and they in turn will
recover from whoever they can. The big mining company can simply add that as a cost of operating. Usually there's very little destruction done to the surface during the exploration program. This isn't always the case. For the most part, exploration efforts don't result in a great deal of surface damage. Another problems is that minerals are only where they occur. You can put a factory most anywhere, but not a mine. The notion should be áto encourage the development of mines where they occur. Not to arbitrarily say, "Okay, it's all right to find a mine here, but it's not all right to find a mine there." Because hell,
57

 ROBERT PRUITT #1
you can't decide in advance where you're going to find a mine. You can only find a mine where it is. Most mines don't consume a great deal of area. I drove through Silverton, Colorado and Ouray, Colorado recently. I was quite impressed with what terrifically beautiful scenic country it was. Boy, this is really beautiful high Colorado Rockies, San Juan Mountains. As I drove over the pass from Silverton down into Ouray, it was nothing but one row of mine dumps after another row of mine dumps and old tumbled-down shacks. I thought, I bet the ecologists go absolutely out of their minds when they see this kind of thing. I stopped and I analyzed what I was looking at. I said to myself, "How come this highway is in this canyon instead of that canyon?"
MH: Because of the mines?
RP: Yes, because of the mines! There never would have
been a road in that particular canyon had it not been for the mines. The tendency is that the roads and the mines come together. The other canyon on the other side of the ridge, I'll bet you was as pristine and beautiful as anything you ever saw. But you didn¥t see it because there was no road. The shallow- thinking ecologist driving along the highway through an area like that would be offended. God, his heart
58

would throb. Yet he wouldn't stop to think that he was seeing the bad side, he wasn't seeing the good
side. The reason he wasn't seeing it was because there had been nobody there before him to build a road so he could drive along it. I hope the day never comes when they build roads up pristine valleys as opposed to past mine dumps. In my opinion, if you've got to build a road somewhere, it ought to be past a mine dump rather than up a pristine valley because it ruins the pristine valley. Still, most people drive roads than hike trails. Somehow that's got to be communicated to the people that voice so much concern. How do you do that and whether you can ever do it is something I don't know.
MH: Well, thank you.
RP: Well, you're welcome. I have talked a long time!
