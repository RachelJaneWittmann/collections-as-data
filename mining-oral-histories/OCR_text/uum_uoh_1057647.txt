THE
GARY
AND THE INTER VIEW I S A T H I S HOME A T 3 1 1 NORTH 4TH WEST I N BLANDING, UTAH.
SS: Mr. Shumway, can you tell me how you happened to be in this country?
SH: Well, my father came out here about three years and looked the country over and he figured it was pretty good country for cattle and so on, so he sold out and he come out here and brought a bunch of cows and wasn't only just one or two families living here at the time, and he had a camp down here in what they call Fiddler's Green and stayed down awhile and then we moved up here to the head of West Water and just herded the cows around the country here and just made a living of it for a year or two and he got to farming a little and kept up things like that and that's all we done in this country for awhile until later on and then later things came up and digging ruins, I and Gary's father and we did that for awhile I guess-- dug up hundreds of them, of course, later on why we started prospecting. That's probably all you want to know
about that.
ss: How did you make any money from digging in the ruins? Did
you sell the artifacts to museums?
SH: We sold these to Professor Carter, North Dakota, he was .
He, I think at that time, lived in Salt Lake. He come down here and we'd dig them up. I think we got a dollar a piece for them, good ones and broken and everything

 S E T H
SHUMW A Y # 1
else, that's what happened there. We just dug them up and by the hundreds and they have that same bunch now it'd be worth thousands of dollars, you know that. Now you get one dish and it's worth anywhere from 20 to 30 dollars. They sell them right here in town, dig them up now, sell them for two or three hundred dollars.
How old were you when the family came here?
I was about 16 at the that time.
SS:
SH:
ss: And how many brothers and sisters did you have that-- SH: At that time they had six brothers, five brothers and six
sisters.
SS: What, you say that you did, that you had some cattle,
SH:
then the family did some farming. What got you interested eventually in going out and looking for minerals?
Well, I don't know what just the first idea was here, and anyway they found out uranium was worth quite a bit and they found out something about ---?--- they knew
prospectors somehow. Some local says I prospect and we found out it was worth quite a lot so we just kind of started prospecting and found a little of it and after we'd found a few pretty good places, why guys got interested, it wasn't worth much. You give them samples and finally they sent some off in different places and they found out they had some high grade. And they came down here in Neil's outfit and they give them some ore
2

 S E T H
SHUMW A Y # 1
samples and about that time this Balsely over there at Moab, he got the chance to sell the ore so he, he sold quite a lot for us. And he just kept getting better all the way through and we kept learning how to prospect them and find claims. That's the whole thing. We just got started in here.
What areas did you find the first high grade in? Around here?
Well, the first real high grade that I remember was down here in the Bucket Wash, what they call the Lonesome claim at the time. They found a great big high tree, great tree there that run about 25-30 percent and they sold that down here to Balsely and that's the first claim there that I remember there on the Morrison. And of course on the Shinarump why I guess White Canyon was the first place we found there on that east.
SS:
SH:
SS: When you found the Lonesome claim you went out, what were, you said that you had been told a little bit about how to prospect. How did you really look for it, what did you look for?
SH: We learnt the certain strata that the Morrison was on, was just different strata. We learned to get that strata and wait for it all the way to San Juan River trail clear up as far as Blanding on both sides. That was on the
Morrison and you learned how to prospect that, and of 3

 SETH SHUMWAY #1
course you found lots of claims, some of them pretty good and some of them wasn't. I didn't know too much about them. And later on when [we] got going that way we learned about the Shinarump and we found different story, of course.
GS: Was the Lonesome the first claim that you found Uncle Seth?
SH: What?
GS: Was the Lonesome the first claim that you found?
SH: I believe it was. I remember, way back in '40. When we
happened to find it, I knew we walked down the road and then we walked and couldn't get out. We went down there and sat on a point of a rock there and both give out and I looked across the canyon and I told him, I says, I bet there's a claim there. I can see a little yellow stain there you know and we went down and found the high grade tree sticking out and when we got looking around we found several of them. If I remember right almost the first
time.
GS: You saw it from clear across the canyon then?
SH: Yeah, just across the canyon there, a little ledge
sticking out and I told him, I says, "That sure looks like a stain to me." We knew what stain was and how to find it, so I walked over and it sure enough was. Then after that when we got looking around we found several of
4

 SET H

them.
You hadn't staked any claims in Cottonwood before that? I haven't. I think Lee and Harris had staked a few in there if I remember and then when I and your dad found it out we went there and we all staked a lot in there.
Seth wouldn't do a lot of prospecting at the first. You
just furnishing money for those boys to start with when they was down in there. He wasn't out prospecting. It was A and Harris and Lee, give him the money for it; he was trapping for the government then.
I was trapping for the government and I quit just about that time. So I was down there and I just paid their way down and everything and they done the prospecting. First time went down that White Canyon country.
What about when the Cottonwood claims out there in 1931. Your name is on the claim location notice. Had you just furnished the money for that and not gone out with the rest of them?
No we went out there, I went out there and Harris and me already took up a lot I remember. And we went out and we took up a lot cause I remember they used to get quite a kick out of them, had something on our lids on some ores and figured there was about 1,500 feet over there and he hollers over and asking how many feet he thought it was
and he just put down 1,500 feet.
SH:
GS:
SH:

 S E T H SHUMW A Y # 1
GS: For staking a claim huh?
SH: Yeah, that's what it takes, 15 by 600 feet see is what
you take.
SS: Can you tell us something about how you got the job of
trapping for the government and what that was like?
SH: Just after we come out here for a while I started helping for my father on the 60 acres he had there. ---?--- and a couple, the government come down there looking for some trappers somehow or another. So I went to work for them all except for a few years and something happened, I quit and then they came after me again the second time, about three different times I guess. After we got it started
they wanted me all the time. After we got used to it, caught a few wolves and coyotes, then they'd want to keep you on so I just kept a trapping. I figured I was about 15 years trapping for them.
SS: What animals did they want you to trap?
SH: Well, at that time there was some wolves out here killing
off the cattle, wolves and coyotes of course and bobcats. That was predatory animals doing lots of damage to sheep and cattle at that time.
SS: I guess when you were out trapping you really got out and saw a lot of the country that way didn't you?
SH: Yes, I knew the country pretty well over and I even remembered the place in Cottonwood we used to ride up and
6

 SETH SHUMWAY # 1
down there all al ong t he ledge on the west side there was a pretty stain. We didn't know what it was at that time-- a yellow stain. And after we got to t ry prospecting I remembered seeing some of those places that we didn't know what it was at that time.
GS: Did you stake claims there where you remembered s ee ing the stain?
SH: Well, yeah after we started prospecting we staked claims there. It was right there just across Cottonwood, where there're big holes.
GS: Had you already staked the claims there before you, I mean by the time you remembered you'd seen that, were the claims already staked?
No, no. There wasn't a stake there at that time. When we started staking it there wasn't anything staked that I remember. We was the first ones there and there we just, after we got started a little why the Shay come along there you know and monkeying around what first we thought was a pretty good place didn't amount to anything. And we sold out to him and he sold out to another man up in
California and I think his---?--- he had a good millions
of dollars.
GS: How much did you sell them for?
SH: I don't think it was very much as I remember. Wasn't much
over a thousand dollars. It was just a little bit. 7
SH:

 S E T H GS: SH:
GS:
SH:
SHUMW A Y # 1
For the entire group of claims?
For the whole grouping, everything in there. It wasn't very much. We never got very much out of it.
Why did you sell them instead of keeping them and developing them.
Well, it wasn't worth much at that time. In fact wasn't worth anything as far as we could tell. We just---?--- and getting started you know and figured we had plenty of claims other places you know and take them up and I don't know, we just sold out for nothing I guess.
Had you tried to work them for yourselves?
No we never worked them. All we done was a little later on, well, just before we sold them we got a few samples. High grade trees out there, next to Cottonwood there, and
we got a few samples and we sent them off and give some to Balsely and so I don't think there were, to get in there with any of the wagons you know or anything at that time.
How did you happen to get in the White Canyon, Red Canyon
GS: SH:
GS:
area and start staking there?
SH: .Well, if I remember, when we got the thing started down,
you know this here, was it Cooper's mine? GS: Happy Jack?
SH: Happy Jack. They, the Hayes owned it. He's the one that found it. He told us about it. He said that he finally
8

 S E T H
SHUMW A Y # 1
decided he'd sell it to us and let us go look at it. And I think Jeff Sorenson owned it at that time. He bought it from Hayes. So went down and looked at it. And I thought that was a good thing and I thought that was a good mine well worth five hundred dollars anyway.---?--- and they came up here and talked it over a little bit and I think I told Viv, I says, the mine's pretty good. I says I guess we got enough, do you think we ought to but it--or something, he didn't care whether we did or not. She says, I don't know. Maybe we hadn't ought to---?--- and I didn't care so we didn't do it and then of course a little later on why I suppose they bought it pretty cheap, the Bronsons, and that's the way it went and they got the millions of dollars.
So you'd gone down and looked at that claim?
GS:
SH: Yeah we looked at that claim; we found out there was
uranium. They didn't know there was uranium in it. Started copper you know. And when we found out there was uranium that was one reason we wanted to buy it. And I guess we was the only ones that knew there was uranium in there and we sent off a sample.
GS: Did, how did you find out that there was uranium there? Did you recognize it when you saw it in the mine?
SH: Yeah, we thought there was uranium in there and we sent off some samples. When we looked at them there was
9

 S E T H
SHUMW A Y # 1
SS:
SH:
uranium in there. We got fooled up a little a time or two
on this yellow oak leaf, there's uranium there too. We
were pretty sure there was. We found out there's some
down there.
When you went to see that claim had they got much of a
¥
shaft going in there then?
Not very much. They done quite a lot of digging with, used just drills you know, like that---?--- Hayes and his fellows down a little single jacking and they had pretty good cylinder down like that and of course after you withdraw a little we could find sticking up on the outside in several places. So everything together we figured if it was worth anything it would be worth that much anyway.
Well, when you saw that there, did you realize right away that this was a new formation that they hadn't . known about the uranium being in before.
Well, we had heard about the uranium with the copper was the main thing we felt when we went there it was a good copper mine though. We knew that uranium was beginning to be worth something like that. If we know it was going to
be worth much, was worth very much why we wouldn't have hesitated to go in there and bought that out. But at that time why we didn't think uranium was worth very much, there was a little in it.
ss:
SH:

 S E T H SHUMW A Y # 1
GS: Even before you had gone down to look at this you had
SH:
GS: SH:
MS: SH:
GS: SH:
GS: SH:
GS:
already staked a claim or two down in the Hideout or somewhere around there hadn't you?
It seemed to me like we had a few claims there. I think we had a few claims somewhere that we staked. Seemed to me like out in Cottonwood was the first place we found out about uranium.
Yeah.
And I have an uncle mined out here and he got some and shipped it back to Russia I believe and he showed me uranium that's--that's the first time I ever remember seeing uranium and what it was like.
Was that Uncle Neph, Uncle Neph Johnson?
Nephi Johnson, out here in Montezuma Creek. I went out with him one day when he mined. I went out with him and he showed me what it was like.
Which claim was that in Montezuma, do you remember?
I can't remember the name of it now, but it was in that - --?--- here, what's the name of that canyon?
Bradford Canyon?
It must have been in Bradford Canyon because I went with
him and he went right straight east.
Now in what, 1943, I believe you staked a claim called the Hideout claim down on Deer Flat. Do you remember anything about that?
11

 S E T H SH:
MS: SS:
SHUMW A Y # 1
Yes. I and Lee and Harris, well we all went down there as far as that goes, and they all staked some claims.
Walt staked that--
But they were quite a little space and asked me to stake too and I went down there and we staked them. I think he called it the Big Buck the first one if I remember right. We staked one or two down in there all right on the river, I remember. At that time too we figured that, and this was the law too, had to be showing you know, and so we just floated around the rim and [where] we found showing we staked it. If it was just another one that got by why we'd have staked that whole airport.
I believe Wile Redd had found a claim down. Can you remember anything about that?
Yeah, Wile Redd come around hunted me up. He knew darn little about uranium and copper and he told me a little about where's some float down there and he wanted me to go down and find a claim and he'd give me half of it. So I went down there and it wasn't very long far enough of floating we found the claims and took them up and a
little later on why I bought him out.
Did you know how good of claims they were when you bought him out?
GS:
SS:
GS:
SH: Well, I knew it was pretty good. There was about four of five foot ledge around and I figured it was pretty good
12

 SETH
GS: SH:
GS: SH: GS: SH:
GS: SH:
GS: SH:
SHUMWAY # 1
deal in there. I thought a lot of it--more than I told him that I .did.
You mean you didn't tell him how good it was?
I didn't tell him how good it was. I didn't know for sure you know but I thought that it was pretty good.
How much--
He's been mad at me ever since.
How much did you give him for his half of it?
What was it? Five hundred dollars? I don't remember for sure. It was either five hundred or a little less than that. It wasn't very much.
And this was the Hideout claim?
Yeah, that was the Hideout, that was the Hideout. Then I take up two or three, I had two or three claims on the Hideout and of course, a little later on why Denny, what's the name over at--?
Fennel Sitton?
Fennel Sitton. You probably know all about that anyway. He come along and bought everything that we had--White Canyon and everything else. He put together, two hundred
thousand I believe the bunch of us and I owned that Hideout alone at that time. And he told us, he says, "If there's anything you own alone you don't have to put it in the group." Somehow or another when I went out to sign
my papers at Dove Creek why he had signed that out. I 13

 S E T H
SHUMW A Y # 1
told him, I says, "I didn't think we was supposed to put in anything you owned private that way." He got off a lot of hieroglyphic words or whatever you call it I didn't quite understand them. He got it on there and I signed up and so he got away with it, and later one why he was sold out for several million and he held out a royalty there, about 20 percent royalty.
Did the Hideout claim prove to be a pretty good mine? Yeah, the Hideout was a good one and then there was another one, Hideout #2 I believe, went with it, something like that and the group there together of course, he just put them all in together. They were all good claims.
Why did you sell out that White Canyon claims to Fennel Sitton?
Well, we just figured it was a pretty good chance to get pretty good start, have quite a lot of money, enough to see us through and we just figured we'd keep on prospecting, which we did and we'd get plenty of other claims you know, but it's true what happened there, he tried to beat us out of it and he did beat us out of a lot. Of course we had that lawsuit and they kept bringing up a little more and more all the time. If we'd stayed away we'd probably got it all, but we give the lawyers $30,000 and now we finally got $50,000 officially but
GS: SH:
GS:
SH:
14

 S E T H
GS:
SH: GS:
SH:
SHUMW A Y # 1
$30,000 wasn't ours and that's the end of it.
Had there been any problems with your mines down in White Canyon of getting them started that made you decided to sell to Fennel Sitton?
Lucky get them started, what do you mean?
Well, as I recall you'd had some problems with Denny Viles, you know with your getting your ore sold.
Oh that part there yeah. We had done a lot of mining there and we got a, he told us that we could just run it through good. He says, it would run through right good. And when he got to running through his mill down right at first it didn't turn out and he only got just a little of it. Didn't amount to much. We didn't get much out of that. Then later on when they tore the mill down they shipped it back up here so they got quite a bit out of it then. He got just a little bit more out of it then. We never did make much out of that deal. I and your father went down there and we worked there, you know how we was there and we got lots of high grade out and shipped down, but he just never did get much out if it.
Tell a little about your mining experience. I remember I was a young boy and I came down and spent a summer with you in White Canyon. Tell about the kind of problems you had with your mines there and the whole experience of
mining in White Canyon.
GS:
15

 S E T H SHUMW A Y # 1
SH: Well, we didn't have much trouble there. We done our
digging out without a compressor, your Dad and me come up that high hill there and we were digging there and all we had to do was shovel it and we just shovelled it up there and hauled it down and that's all the money. I don't think we only used any powder there in that place, but we had a lot of experience there. We found out how to find a high grade all the time. Kept afinding a little better and one thing and the other. We just pile it up there, we had some about one percent stuff around the hill there. He'd have a lot of fun a working there and we, if we'd got what he said we'd get out if it, why we was making about a thousand dollars a day there, but it just turned out we didn't make anything out of it at all, after regular hours.
SS: When you were, you knew that Denny Viles was going to put that plant down there and you knew you had some good claims there, do you know why they decided to put the mill right there?
SH: Yes. Yeah he had a lot of samples, we get a lot of samples and he says we'll just run that through that mill he says, it'11 just save it all. He tried it out on something he had up there and was wondering whatever
happened there, that it just didn't run through like he thought it should. And he had us all excited and he built
16

 S E T H
SHUMW A Y # 1
the mill. Of course he was pretty sure of it. But I don't think the mill run nothing through there, but later on they went down and shipped all the tailings over to Durango m ill.
So when he decided, when the company, VCA decided to put the mill down there, they thought they could recover real well on that copper and uranium?
Yeah, they sure did.
Was this the White Canyon #1 and what claims was it or where did you send the ore from, to that mill down there? What did they, make no difference. Of course Harris and Lee had these White Canyon #1 mostly. They got lots of ore out of their claim. They shipped it there too. This was the government way wasn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah. The government White Canyon #1 and several claims I think my brothers shipped ore out of, but this why we shipped ours.
SS:
SH: SS:
SH:
GS: SH:
GS: I remember we were down there and we didn't have very much water.
SH: Well, the water was pretty scarce. It wasn't too good. GS: Do you remember that big lizard that kept coming up to
the water bank there?
SH: Yeah. It looked pretty tame though. Looking for flies or
something. I remember. What did your father do with that 17

 S E T H SHUMW A Y # 1
there coal he found, petrified pine nuts in the coal. That was the darnedest thing I ever seen.
GS: You know, I'd forgotten all about that. I wonder where that is?
SH: He let some boys take it up there to Salt Lake and I don't think he ever got it back. I'd sure like to have-- you know we was going down that gully there and we both seen them at the same time. He was ahead of me a little bit. He just reached down and picked it up. I wished we'd looked around. Probably some more around there.
SS: After you had sold that group of claims in White Canyon to Fennel Sitton and you felt like that there were more claims that you could locate and maybe develop or sell, did you go out prospecting again right away and look around some more?
SH:
I don't think we ever went back down there to get any. We just kind of quit that country because he, if we went down there he'd accuse of us trying to jump one of his claims or one thing another. He done everything in the
world he could. He even took lawyers down on the claim. I went down this way over here and he told us, he said now where is that corner, you got that certain number on the corner? And I told him yeah, if I could find it. You know he just kind of laughed to himself. He didn't think I ever put it up there and he didn't think I'd ever find
18

 S E T H
SHUMW A Y # 1
it. And I went over and took him right to it. He was surprised. And old Fennel never could get anything off us at all, found out everything's all right. No, we didn't go back down to prospect.
---?--- you wouldn't prospect, you'd been so many miles through White Canyon.
Is that correct, you signed an agreement not to prospect
in that area?
Well we--
Yes, it is. That's why you didn't go back and prospect. You signed a, that you couldn't prospect so close back there. So the boys went down in there and started do in them. And then you and A found that.
Maybe that was down there.
I know you signed something that you couldn't prospect down there.
We signed something probably. We may have done all right. I think you signed, he had everything fixed up that he--
MS:
GS:
SH: MS:
SH: MS:
SH:
MS:
SH: Was out in Cottonwood when he sold it.
MS: Was that when you signed it to. I know some place you
signed it to him.
SH: I believe that was in Cottonwood. We didn't think there
was anything else down in White Canyon. We would file at that time. You'd have to do drilling you know. It's no longer anytime you find any good claims you just about
19

 S E T H
GS:
SH:
GS: SH:
SHUMW A Y # 1
got to go in drilling.
So, where did you go there from White Canyon, to do your prospecting next?
Well, we after that, I don't know just around, we had a
few claims all over the country around the Butler and around you know and we kind of took care of them. I don't know if we ever done much prospecting after that or not. What about the Knotch claim? When did you get them? Well, I guess we took them after we sold out all right. Yeah, yeah that's what we did I think. I went out there, I and Burdette and all of us and took out that Knotch and all them claims out there. There was sure some good ones too, really good. And they shipped from Texas come up here. What was his name, that Texas guy? He got a lease on everything somehow or another.
Ransomes you mean?
No. This was out here at the Big Knotch and through there. That fellow from Texas.
Mr. Beacons wasn't it?
Beacons, yeah. He got that and monkeyed around and beat us out of a lot of that there. And later on why Ted Redd
went out there and drilled and drilled for Beacons and somehow another he found a lot of ore there and the boys either had to work it and dig up 25 percent--I give Pep Redd 25 percent I believe. I think he made about a
GS: SH:
MS: SH:
20

 S E T H
GS: SH:
MD:
SH:
SHUMW A Y # 1
million dollars on it. Of course there was a bunch of men on it to buy it. They really found some good ore out there on that ranch.
What claim was that?
What the dickens was that claim? There's so many of them
out there.
Payday, one of those?
Payday and the Lick I believe what we called them. There was two or three Payday's named but this one Payday was sure a good one. Of course we just know, well them fellows claimed they was going to do so much and they, quirked a little and one thing another and didn't think there was very much out there, and just didn't turn out very good.
What happened to the Knotch claims?
Well, this Knotch claim I guess was kind of put in with the rest of them somehow or another. I don't know any they ever found. They still own the Knotch, his boys is out there. I don't think they ever found very much ore on it. They've done a little drilling; they're going to do
some more. They own quite a lot of claims out there yet, that country. Maybe someday they'11 turn out to be pretty good again.
What ever made you decide to go up on Elk Ridge staking, do you remember prospecting?
GS: SH:
GS:
21

 S E T H SH:
SHUMW A Y # 1
Yeah, there's some severe, somebody told me they'd found some ore up there that had a geiger counter there at the Knotch and says it run pretty good. So we went up there and we found it and it did run pretty good. Then we just started down, and around--
Do you remember who the surveyors were?
No, I don't remember just who they was.
How did you happen to go up into the upper Cottonwood country?
Well, let's see, I don't know, it seemed like somebody found a claim up there. Anyway I wanted to prospect up there and it was Cardon Jones and Clarence Rogers I believe, somebody else told me if I'd go up there with them why they'd furnish the outfit. So I went up there and I had a little old geiger counter and I went up along there and I found a claim or two and then they went up two or three different times and we found two or three
claims there. And little later on why we decided to go find another one up there. So we went up there to pick up some more. And there was quite a lot of ore around this one claim and somehow or another we got them Ransomes up there and got them interested in it and we started to go
and give them a deal.
GS: SH: GS:
SH:
Who were the Ransomes?
GS:
SH: Ray Ransome you know?
22

 S E T H SHUMW A Y # 1
MS: They were from New Mexico, somewhere.
SH: Oh.
MS: I say they were from New Mexico, Ray and Glen Ransome.
SH: Yeah they told me they were from New Mexico. They come over here I don't know how it happened they come over here, prospecting around if it was a pretty good claim he'd send some ore off and have it sampled and they just started, just took and chance on it and they struck a lot of ore. King Edwards you know, the King James was the ones they had. They struck lots of ore and they got going and kept a going there and finally, course they sold out and we sold out too. And we just about sold--I guess I've sold everything out now. The boys, they still have a deal on some mine, fixed up some way. I've never got all my money out of it yet, quite.
GS: Did you do any prospecting after the Cottonwood, the upper Cottonwood group?
SH: Well, you mean after we found them? GS: Yes.
SH:
I don't think I've done much prospecting after that. They just up the whole country you know, different ones, the boys. Brosons they took up everything and then we did too. Anything for them to prospect for them. What Ransome didn't take why other guys took. They got that whole country took up in there. They kept a going back you know
23

and they got that claim way back there, the Round Mountain on North Hill and that's an awful good one. I don't know if they did anything about it. They got some awful good claims there.
Have you seen the claims?
No, I've never been up to them. The boys have took up some, everything that was left there, they owned some claims up around in there, just have to be drilled you know. They don't know whether there's anything in there or not.
They just sold that, they sold that claim up there at Round Mountain.
Who?
Nugent, Mr. Nugent. Isn't he the one that's running that claim up on Round Mountain now? They're still working up there.
I don't know.
Operating that mine.

Yeah the boys would know who that is.
They had Iva Lews cabin up there this summer because they was up there drilling.
Yeah, Jeannie, Jeannie would know all about that and Grant. I don't know nothing. I kind of quit that business pretty much and I still got quite a few claims that ain't much good. Trying to hold thinking another couple years
you know the thing might get pretty good. What claims do you still own?
I got what they---?--- call down there. I got about ten claims in there and then I got an interest in the D.A. of Jones up there. I got one claim out of Montezuma and I got what you call the Moonlight right there across Cottonwood there at W~isker's Jaw. That's the size of my claim. Just holding along to see if anything happens.
Do you still have the High Hopes?
No, no. I don't remember who owns that up there now. Your son has come along and been very successful in mining uranium. Did they start out as young fellows going out with you and your brothers?
Pretty much, yes. They very, they done pretty good all their lives, that's about all they've done is, they're
still mining.
Boys and Devarr went out on a prospecting deal with it.
Wasn't the boys at one time Gary? They was kind of out on 25

their own I think.
SH: The whole thing never got good again through. The time ever come, I think it will, Grant showed me, sheepherder and he ---?--- again. You never know what's going to happen. Anyway the whole country's took up. And they're going to have to do a lot of surface work to hold it and I guess they'll all hold them maybe. And then they do a lot of drilling sometimes in this country and still find a lot of ore, I don't know.
GS: What have you done since you got out of the uranium business.
SH:
I've been running a bunch of cows. I've got about 80 head of cows up here and we got about five or six hundred acres of land and just put the time in those, you know hobby like and kind of keep my health going good and something I like to do you know.
How old are you now Uncle Seth?
GS:
SH: Oh 77.
GS: 77?
SH: Yeah. I went and got an exam the other day up here and
went through everything they could think of and I haven't got anything bad. I don't think they found too much wrong with me. I've got a little trouble with stomach and so on but I guess I'm pretty good for the shape I'm in.
GS: A question that I had concerning your early, early life. 26

 S E T H SHUMW A Y # 1
What was Blanding like when you came? When you and all your brothers and your mother and father came here, what do you recall about the town?
SH: Well, like I told you before, we camped down here at Fiddler's green with a bunch of cows and my father knew the country here, though he had [not] been in it long, so they came up with a buggy. They had a Sunday School here. They held it under a cedar tree down there and I come up there once or twice. Finally some of my brothers come up there to dance and there was only three or four girls here. And they just come to learn and I asked them about it the next day and they said all there was four redheaded girls up there. And that was the kind off country it was you know and he cut this farm down here and I got trapping for the government and put my time in that way, and digging ruins and that tells you about how far you know. We knew the pottery was worth quite a bit over there in Farmington, New Mexico, so I dug up a lot of them down there where we was at in Recapture. And I dug up one dish there I don't think that there was another one like it in the world or ever heard. It was a pretty pottery about that high, kind of mug shaped and on
top of it they had kind of a green lizard. The lizard was perfect. It had a head turned. But we had oh, we must have had a hundred dishes that way and we hooked up a
27

 SETH SHUMWAY # 1
team and buggy, had a new buggy, take them over and sell them at Farmington. And we hooked up behind there kind of a---?--- and had one tame one and took one of them over to Montezuma there to a well. We stopped there and watered the horses and Dad told me, get out and take the bridle off of this one so he could get a drink. I took the bridle off and before I got the bridle off there was a bunch of mustangs come running up there to get a drink and scared him and they got away from us and go up in them big rocks and tipped the buggy and broke every dish we had.
GS: After all the work of finding them and digging them up huh?
SH:
GS: SH:
Yes sir. And that there bunch of dishes we had there now, I bet would be worth I don't know how much. Fifty thousand dollars I guess. And it's sure a pretty one. Were there mustangs wild horses then?
Yeah, these were wild horses that used to drink in there and they used to come running up there to get a drink, and just one of the horses kind of----?---- anyway, he just got away on the rocks and tipped that buggy upside down an went on off aways and got strung up on a cedar tree and got them back. But the dishes broke up. I don't
think we ever picked one up at all.
GS: Maybe they're still there then and we can go get the

pieces.
No, I looked around there for a few years ago and couldn't find them. I thi nk this guy ' s picked up pieces. They've got so many peopl e there now pick up old pieces
of pottery and everything they can f i nd.
You say you had Sunday School underneath a cedar t ree when you were here.
Yeah. Sunday School over there.
What year did you come out here? 19--?
About 1909 or '10. Yeah, they was Lymans and then Black come out with just a few die, I think Blacks had one little house built down there and ---?--- only house around. I didn't know too much. I didn't look around too much around here, but they didn't have any houses here that amounted to anything at all.
You mean you spent your time out at the farm in Fiddler's Green?
Yeah, we spent most of our time with the cattle down here. Then they got the farm down there. Of course there
was other people come here right away, quick, and Lymans and Shumways already here and then we worked on a ditch up there and got that ditch out here on White Face, see. At that time they just had an old road up Mustang over there from Bluff. They didn't have a road through here. They run an old wagon through there and at that and then

a horseback most of the time, and just kept getting a little better and better ever since and that's the kind of pioneers we was when we first come here.
You were right in on the pioneering part of it then? Well, pretty much. Of course, we was first to come through the Hole in the Rock---?--- and there and all, but we done quite a lot of pioneering here.
When did you move into town?
Oh, I think we moved into town about, it wasn't much over a year a couple years after we come out here. We had a little old house down here where Doug's store is now and they had a school here, started a school you know.
Did you go to school here in town?
Yeah, yeah, I went to school over at Lyman and a fellow by the name of Argyle and two or three. I went to school here clear up to the eight grade, eighth grade is all I ever did get through. I---?--- I had to get out and tend the cows and my dad he couldn't come to them very well, and then there was three or four of us called into the army about that time. My dad couldn't tend the cows very
good and then when I came back why I didn't finish up school--I should. I just went in there. I, a little bit like the guy that said he only went to school one day in his life and then that day the teacher didn't come.

GS: Where did you serve in the army?
SH: Well, we went down to Camp curry to start with in the
light artillery and went across. Went down a doughboy and trained there for about six months. And they, went to Camp Lewis first and then down there and somehow or another I was an alternate and they just picked me up one day and sent me overseas. I was all alone. Now that's everything, I went overseas and I was in the light artillery over there, when I got over there, trained there quite a bit and d~n here and all the time I was overseas I was in the light artillery and I got lost in the outfit. I got a little too shuffled in the (Hawaii?) there and they sent me down there and after that they sent me as MP back up there and when the Congress signed I went on into Germany and so on. I just got to see a lot of country is all.
GS: Were you in on any of the battles?
SH: Yeah we was up there. That's how I got some shot and
there for awhile in up there in Oregon. It was in Oregon but when they sent me back and then they kept me back aways in the MP post you know. They sent me on in Germany. We was up there for a little while.
GS: So you were in France your entire--? SH: Yes.

Well, he got to go to church down here as I remember, old Mexico and he just kind of got acquainted there I guess and I remember---?--- church one day and go for a walk, the first time I think I met her.
You asked her to go for a walk?
Yeah, I think so. Maybe she could tell you a little better than I could.
Well, we'll ask Aunt Vivian to tell us a little bit about her experiences when we get through here.
I don't think I ever heard her tell anything about it. Well, we'll ask her when we get through. Had Blanding changed quite a bit while you were, between the time that you came here and the time that you left for the army? Oh yeah, it had changed a lot at that time. I was trapping when I was called in the army. First time I and Harris I believe, and it just happened that he caught a couple of, one wolf down here and we had eight coyotes and a guy come down and told us to gather up our stuff and we just got a call the army and we speeded down and
gathered up things and we had a wolf and eight coyotes that day and there was quite a few people here you know, about 1919. Blanding was built up pretty good at that time.
GS: Where had the people come from?
SH: Oh Old Mexico and out here in New Mexico, all of these

Blacks came from over there or quite a few come from Mexico and these Lymans already here you know and I don't know just around here close, the country around here. Well, you've raised a large family here. How many children do you have?
Well, we've got 11 left, we had 12 you know. Burdette died. So we raised them all in this house right here. We've only got 11 left. That's not a very big family. The
government's going to sue us for having that many, it looks like.
About got rid of them all huh?
Well, they all live around pretty close to here, most of them. Yeah, we got pretty good bunch I guess. They're all married now it seems like and pretty well, pretty happy about it. Most of them lives around the Blanding area. Thought I had a picture here--
You got a bunch of pictures. We had a golden wedding here awhile back and got together on things pretty well. We got a picture of it somewhere. Montezuma paper, tore out one and--well, I think there's quite a big difference the kids hadn't had that arthritis. We wouldn't had been here. We'd been in the house over here. We moved in here so that Ida could take care of her and so on. That's what
happened.
You just built an extension on to your home then?

Yeah.
I don't know which of these pictures are the best, the family. But we've got a big picture of the family with Burdette here somewhere.
You haven't got the one that was in the paper somewhere? I had it right there in that drawer but I couldn't find it. On the front page .of the San Juan.
Boy that's a nice family isn't it? Good looking boys. Boy I'll say. There's really a fine family.
Pictures that's got the whole family around it and us in the middle with Burdette on it too in that one.
Lot better looking than that picture when you were a child, that picture of Grandpa Shumway.
You got one of those?
How did you ever see one of them?
Well, I just saw one in Mom and Dad's scrapbook and boy that's a sad look. Have you got one of those around here? I think somewhere.
I'd like to find one of those to put in--

MS: I've got one here somewhere. I don't know just where. SH: Well, I was all of three years old I guess.
