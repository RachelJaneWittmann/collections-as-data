 THIS IS A RECORDING OF AN INTERVIEW WITH MR. JOHN BILLSIE, A NAVAJO MINER, FOR THE URANIUM INDUSTRY ORAL HISTORY PROJECT. THE INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE AT MR. BILLSIE'S HOME IN WESTWATER CANYON, NORTH OF BLANDING, UTAH. THE INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE ON AUGUST 10TH, 1970
AT APPROXIMATELY SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING. THIS WAS RECORDED ON A CASSETTE TAPE ORIGINALLY AND THERE WAS SOME MECHANICAL DIFFI- CULTIES WHICH ALLOWED A PREVIOUS RECORDING TO COME THROUGH. THE INTERVIEWER·IS KATHY BIEL.
KB: The first portion of this tape was not recorded because of the mechanical difficulty that was previously mentioned. Mr. Billsie said that he was born in Kayenta in 1935, and that his family moved to the Blanding area because of a lack of jobs available in the Kayenta area. At the age of eleven he began working for a farmer in Blanding cutting fenceposts. He then·began working in the mines at the age of thirteen.
KB.: Okay, you want to give me your name?
JB: Johnny Billsie
KB: Okay, Johnny, you told me you were born-- JB: Start mining--
KB: At thirteen?
JB: Y es.
KB: That's awfully young. What year was that? JR: It was back in 19--about 1947, I guess.
KB: In 1947, that far back?

In 1952, when I start mining.
In the uranium mines?
Y es.
Then you were never in vanadium. You never mined vanadium? Yes, I was mining vanadium out here in Cottonwood for Shumway-- Glen Shumway.
G l e n Shumway?
Yes, that's who I was working for.
And that was your first mining job?
That's right, that was my first mining job, yes.
That's awfully young. Were there many other guys as young as you who were mining?
No, no.
How come he hired you, such a young boy?
Well, hew.anted somebody to work around there.
And you were there?
KB..:
JK:
KB.:
JB: He didn't have many--he didn't find any man to work long enough to
stay. They just go off and leave.
KR: Why did they do that?
JB.: I don't know. It was just that--they don't have a machine at that
time. They don't have-- KB~ All hy hand?

 BILLSIE PAGE 4
KB: T ill you were about sixteen?
JB: Yeah. Then we--when we ran out of ore, then I left. They laid me
off, so I didn't go hack to work. And I found me another job mining. KB: And who was that with? The name of the mine?
JB: Rattlesnake.
KB: Rattlesnake mine? And---?---? See what it sounds like? I'm having
a lot of trouble with this tape recorder. Okay, you left Glen Shumway when you were about sixteen. The mine played out and then you went there.
JB: And then I went mining for this company by the name of--it's been so long since I worked for this company I can't--
KB.: Was i t ---?---
JB..: Yes, he's--they're not from this area. Uh, this man that used to
own the mine, his name is---?---.
KB·~ lhmn. Where was the mine located?
JB.: He was--the mine was located up--right next to the Bears Ears, up
there on the north side of the reservation. KB.: At White Canyon?
JB'.: No, it's on the side of White Canyon.
KB~: Oh., on that side of White Canyon.
JB.: This area was mined back in about in 1956.
KB: And did you have a different kind of job there?

Yes, I was driving my--1 was driving my shuttle buggy.
Shuttle b.uggy?
Yeah. I was driving the shuttle buggy, and the other guy was loading ore with one of the loaders, a cat.
Uh huh. So you were in to it with more equipment, bigger equipment b.y then?
Yeah, bigger equipment then.
Did he teach you how to run the shuttle buggy or--
I just learned it myself.
You just learned it yourself?
Yeah. And now it's my experience--driving a while that shuttle buggy. Uh huh. What did you do after that then?
Well, I've done a·lot of work between--from there to Tuba, another five years. From there I worked a different mine and a different job.--not in that mine, just the outside job.
By outside jobs, you mean, nothing to do with mining?
No, nothing to do with mining except until about two years ago, I guess--two or three years ago that was I stopped mining for---?---
Shumway's.
KB.: Last time I ---?---?
JB.: ---?--- Shumway's Mine, I think it was. KB:: Would it be Grant Shumway.

KB:
No, not Grant Shumway. Can't--can't remember the first name they
call the Shumway mine.
You don't recall the name of the mine? Okay, you worked out in Rifle, Colorado?
Yes. Yeah, we were out there working on another mine.
Now did you drive a shuttle buggy there, too.
Uh huh. Yeah, I was driving the shuttle buggy, then I was driving
a loader, a bobcat. And I was driving it, and then I'd fill up the shuttle buggy, then I'd take it out and come back and start loading again.
You did b.oth jobs?
Yeah, I did both jqbs.
You loaded it and drove it off?
Y eah.
Did you get paid more for that, for doing both jobs?
Yes. I was getting paid about three dollars and forty-five cents an hour.
That sounds ab.out the most I've heard of.
Y eah.
What kind of miners were working at that mine?
JB.:
KB.:
JB: Well, the other boys was the drillers, you know, they was using a
jackhannner, so they used a drill. So they ain't got nothing to do

 BILLSIE PAGE 7
for these jobs---?---. There's Bob Kenner of The Shumway Company, he ain't got nothing to do except sitting there. They---?--- jobs. They got Gene Halls to go in, so he's working on the outside, and I'd be working on the other side.
KK: Did he come in a shoot the dynamite, too?
JB.: Yeah.
KB.: Were there ever any accidents in the mines you worked in? JB: Never have.
KB.: Never had any accidents? Not even any ---?---?
JB.: No.
KB: That's really remarkable.
JB.: Yeah.
KB: What about the smoke? Did you ever have any trouble with the smoke? The ventilation?
JB.: Well, in some of the places, yes. Some of the places they had the-- well, they let you go in there while the smoke's still in there.
KB.: They made you go in?
JB.: Yes. Some of the miners, they don't allow it. But they--they--that's
the law. You're not supposed to let the men in while there's still
smoke inside.
KB.: B.ut some of the miners made you go in? JB: But some of the miners does, yes.

 BILLSIE PAGE 8
Kn.: JB: KB:: JB-:
KB.:
JB.: KB: JB:
Did you tell them that it was dangerous--that you didn't want to go? Yes, yes. They just don't listen, though.
Well, what about the mine inspector? Couldn't you tell him?
Well, the mine inspector don't come around, oh maybe, oh, it's quite a while b.efore he gets there.
But you didn't tell him when he came that you were being made to go in while it was smoking?
Uh, no.
What mine was this at in particular?
Well, it was at Rifle, Colorado, that I was working for--in Shumway's mine.
Uh huh. Did you pull pretty high grade ore out of there?
KB.:
JR: Well, it was not very much--just a little.
KB.: Uh huh. How long did you stay there?
JR: I stay there until--about eight months, I guess.
KB,: Only eight months. Was ·that pinched out, too?
JB..: Yeah. It was pinched out, and then we--we went back. Then I worked
for--after I got back, I went to work for Ralph Noonan, that man that ---?---to---?--- Ford. Then I went and talked to---?--- Ford down here. He lives right here. And then I went and work for--I worked for him for ab.out two years.
KR: A t---?---?

 BILLSIE PAGE 9
JB: At---?---, the other side of Bear's Ears.
KB: Do you know the name of his mine?
JB: No, let me see. I got a pay period here somewhere with his company
name on in. I think--I don't have--it's got this company name on it,
I think.
KB: But it's for Ralph Noonan?
JB.: Yeah, it's from Ralph Noonan. See it's R. G. Noonan.
KB: Has he shut down this mine?
JB.: Yeah, it was shut down.
KB: Was it played out, too?
JB.: Yeah, it's been played out.
KB: Was that the last mine you worked at?
JB: Yeah, that's the last mine that I worked for this man.
KB,: You haven't been back to mining since, huh?
JR: No, anyway I haven't. You can't find any mining jobs.
KB: Have you thought about going ou~ to La Sal Creek at the DeVar Shumway--
from Colorado?
JB: That's over in La Sal, isn't it?
KB.: Uh huh.
JB.: No, I never have. No, I never have gone out there.
KB.: How did you like mining as a living. Did you think it was a great job?

 BILLSIE PAGE 10
JB: Well, yes, it's a good job. It's a good job if you have experience. If you--if you know how to do it, it's a good job.
KB.: Do some of them lack experience, some of them not know what they're doing?
JB.: Well, some of them don't. Some of them just work two or three days and then leave. They don't have the experience.
KB.: You mean that make the job harder for them?
JK: Oh yeah, that make the job harder for--for any person.
KB.: Yeah. Well, will these guys--will the miners train these men? Will
they take the time to train them, or are you expected to know it when you come onto the job?
JB..: Well, you have the mining experience. It takes some new men in there. They got to teach them how to do it and teach them how to operate the equipment. That's th.e only way you can train a man.
KB: And have someb.ody in the mine training them?
JB: Y es.
KB.: Will they pay you while you're learning?
JB: Well, not necessarily, no. Some places they don't; some places they
pay you.
KB: Do you think--do you think there'll ever be any more mines opened up
around here so you and these other guys can go back to mining? JB: Well, I don't know. But I just--

 BILLSIE PAGE 11
KB.: You'd like to go back, then?
JB: Yes, yes, I love mining.
KB: You don't mine going down inside, or would you rather work up on
top7
JB: I don't mind having to go inside.
KB: Uh, this last mine for Noonan, did you run a loader and a shuttle
car there, too? JB: Y es.
KB: Both jobs?
JB: Yeah, I had both jobs. And I was help the drillers. KB: Oh, you were helping the drillers.
JB.: Yeah.
KB.: How did you do that?
JB.: Well, I had the--anything they need from there. After I clean all
the ore out and take it out, then if they need some help, then I
just go back inside and help the drillers.
IGt: Would you ever shoot the dynamite for them?
JB: Oh, yeah.
KB_: Was that a pretty dangerous job, shooting the dynamite?
JR: Yeah. It's kind of dangerous unless you have experience. There's
nothing to it. If you had experience, there's nothing to it. KB.: But you'd have to know how to judge the fuses, don't:you?

 BELLS I E P AGE 1 2
JB: Yes. Yes. I was--I was a primer man for Ralph Noonan.
KB: Oh, uh huh.
JB: So I make up primers for him. Go back in there and load them holes,
light them, and shoot them. That's how it is done.
KB: Well, you've certainly had a lot of experience. What kind of jobs
have you been doing since, or are you just waiting for the mines
to open again, or--?
JB: Well, right now I'm--I've been teaching graphic arts right here in
Blanding. KB_: You are?
JB.: Yeah.
KB:: Down here on ---?---? My, that kind of--
JR: Well, it's graphic arts, teaching these guys to learn how to--how
to set a type, how to print a newspaper, how to print-- On linotype?
Y es.

JR:
KB::
JB.: Well, I was working up there at B.YU in Provo. That's where I learn
Where did you learn that?

KB.: At BYU?
J B -: Y e s . •
KR: Did you go to BYU?

 BILLSIE PAGE 13
JB: KB:
JB: KB: JB: KB.: JB.: KB:
JB: KR:
No, I was just working there.
You were working there. When was that? In between all your mining jobs?
Well, that was hack in 19-- since 1964. No, 1959 to 1964.
Oh, those five years that you weren't in the mine?
No, when I wasn't in the mine, I was up there in Provo---?---
Did you go up there by yourself, or did you take your family?
I went there by myself.
Did you go up there on a training program, or did you just go up there to work?
Well, that's ---?--- worked.
Uh huh. Would you explain to me about this program you have back here? Do you teach graphic art? How often do you teach out here? What other kinds of programs do they have out there?
JB.: Well, they have--this company they have now, it used to be ---?--- Corporation, but now that---?--- Corporation went broke--
KB.: Who is that sponsored by, the---?---?
JB.: It's b.y th.e Navajo Trib.al Center out at Window Rock.
KB.: Oh, and they went broke?
JB.: Yeah, they went broke. So BYD has taken over. They already have
taken over, so they have all these trainees-----?---, graphic arts, secretarial training, and building trade, picture framing, auto

 BILLSIE PAGE 14
mechanics. I guess that's ab.out all---?---.
KB: After they train these people, do they help them find jobs around here? JB: Well, they--some of them, they go and find jobs for them, some of
them are going to stay there.·
KB: They're going to stay there at the Center?
JB: Yeah, at the center where they--where they've been trained. Some
of them, they are going to stay and train some more people that come
in here. So they can have the experience to tell them what to do. KB.: Now is that the building next to the City Hall?
JB: Y es.
KB.: Is that where it is? How long dies it take to train a linotype man? JR: Well, it all depends. It all depends on--it just takes your educa-
tion sometimes.
KB.: Yeah. Are there a lot of people that are wanting to go up there and
learn these different jobs?
JR: Yeah., there's quite a few of them, yes.
KB.: Can you handle them all, or do you have a waiting list?
JB: Well, I have two crews: one morning crew and one afternoon crew.
I have two crews.
KB.: Uh huh. Are they paid at all while they're learning, or how do
they make a living while they're being trained? JB.: Well, they pay them.

 BILLSIE PAGE 15
KB.: JB.: KR: JB:
KB..:
JB.:
They're paid?
Yeah, they pay them yeah.
Uh, BYU pay them, or--?
Uh, part of them, BYU pays, and part of it the welfare pays. So that's how all these trainees live.
Uh, what about silver smithing and jobs like that?
Well, silver smithing is--they used to have silver smithing, but now they don't have it.
Is this anyway involved with that WIN program?
Y es.
That ·Hanson heads?
KB.:
JB:
KB.:
JR: Yeah, it used to be WIN. KB..: But it's not that anymore. JB'.: No, it's not that anymore.
KB.: Is Hanson still over there, though?
JB..: Yeah, he's still there, yes. He's still there, yeah.
KB: Do you think these people will find jobs in Blanding, or will they
have to go somewhere else2
JR: Well, it all depends on what they want.
KB.: Yeah.
JB.: You can always go out and find a job somewhere like out in California,
and anywhere out of this state that they think they want to go.

 B.ILLSIE PAGE 16
KB: Do you think any of them will go back to the reservation?
JB: Yeah, some of them, yes. They'll---?--- finding jobs by learning
some---?--- and finding a job.. If they don't find it, they'll
just have to wait. That's how they work.
KB: But you'd still prefer mining to teaching the graphic arts?
JR: Yes. ·
KB: That's a lot harder work, isn't it? This might be the easier job. JB.: The graphic art, they're just sitting in that room and---?---
KB-: Oh, I see, my ink is in shape--
JB~ I've done a lot of hard works.
KB.: It sounds like it. Starting when you were very young.
JB.: When I got this job, then I just sat around.
KB,: You're not used to it!
JB.: I'm not used to it. I ---?--- work somewhere.
KK: Well, that's unusual to find a man that would rather have hard work than an easy soft job. What ahout--about your sons here? What
would you like for them to do when they grow up? JB.: Well, they can take my place, I guess.
KK: In mining, or the graphic arts?
JB.: Get on my shoes and go out, I guess.
KB: Do you think there'll b.e a job in mining for them?
JK: There might be. You never know what's going to be coming up.

JB.:
KB.: JB.: KB.: JB.: KB.: JB.: KB.: J B.: KB.: JR.:
KB.: JK:
I hear that the price of ore is supposed to go up eventually. Maybe they'll open up these mines again. Have you thought about going down on the reservation and mining down there when the mines were going? Had you considered it?
Yes, I got--I got a little land down there. You have land down there?
Of my own, yes.
From your family?
No, I just got a little. We've got our own crop there.
Oh, you do. Is it farm land then?
Yes.
Do you have it under cultivation? Are you farming it now?
Y es.
You are?
Yes. I got a lot of--a lot of relatives down there taking care of the farm now.
Oh.•
So I'm up here. And I'll go down and give them some help checking over the farm.
KK: Yeah, they think they're---?--- They think they're doing all right down there.
JB: Yeah. I got peach orchards down there.

 BILLSIE PAGE 18
KB: JB.: KB: JR:
KB.: JB:
Oh, you do?
It's o.een given to me by my Dad a long time ago when I was a kid.
Is that down in Kayenta?
Yeah, it's right by Kayenta. About twelves miles, I guess, uh, north-- southwest at---?--- to---?--- Trading Post.
Oh, yeah.
It's right below the side. You can see peach trees growing up there at---?--- Trading Post. You can see from that road going out.
There is a ·p.ea~b orchard right across the creek.
Well, I'll look for it when I go out there.
And the next one, too.
The next one, too?
KB.:
JR:
KB.:
JB.: Yeah, there's another field right--right below that. There's a lot
of peaches on them, prunes, and stuff like that.
KR: Well, I'll be darned. Well, when they had those mines, Monument
Numb.er Two, and One, and Three, and Cato I and II, did you ever condiser going down there so you could be on your land and mining at the same time?
JR: Well, I don't know if they're still mining there or not.
KB.: They're not mining now, but when they were--they've been closed down
ahout three years. But, you never considered it? JB: No. I never have.

 BILLSIE PAGE 19
KB: You want to live in Blanding, huh?
JB.: I always wanted to, because I had one mine claim down there.
KB.: You did?
JB: On the farm, yeah.
KB.: A claim. You prospected it yourself and staked it. Did you ever
do any work on it?
JB.: No, this man I was telling you about, Ralph Noonan, I told him about
it, and he was going to help me to mine it, and he was going to take his equipment down there and we---?--- I don't have the time to
to to Window Rock to get my papers---?------?---
KB.: ---?---?
JB: ---?---, yes. But I had to go down there to Window Rock.
KB·: Well, when did you stake the claim?
JR: Oh, it's a long time ago.
KB: Aren't you afraid someone else will stake or--can't they because it's
on your property?
JB.: No, it's on my property. They can't stake it.
KB.: Do you--could you take any ore out of there?
JB.: Yeah, I think so. ---?--- checked it, I guess. See if---?--- And
I've had some pretty hard stuff in there.
KB.: Well, if you hold onto it and the price goes up, it might be worth
going down there and mining.

 BILLS IE PAGE 20
JB: That sounds--that man whose helping me, he says that all the---?--- of the mine has gone out, and he says, if it does, we're going--we're going down to your claim, and let's start working on it.
KR: Noonan said that? JB: lJh huh.
KB:
JB: KB:
JB:
KB.: JB:
Then you'd b.e partners with Noonan?
Y es.
Oh, now you---?-- rich man and---?---
your teaching and your crews.
Oh, I don't know. There's a lot of things to do.
Sounds like it.
I have a lot of things on my mind to do, that I wanted to do, that
I wanted to get started. But I'm always right between those jobs, and I can't make up my mind what I--what next I'll be doing. I just don't know what to do.
KB: Well, you've got a lot of time left ahead of you, though. JB~ Yeah, quite a few yet.
KB_: Well, you've been luckier than most so far, haven't you? JR: Yeah, so far.
KB": Is this your family over here?
JB: Yes, that with---?--- is my wife. KB_: That 's your b.aby?
Between your teachers and

KB: Well, Mr. Rillsie, I certainly appreciate your talking to me. You've given me a lot of good information and I certainly do appreciate it.
