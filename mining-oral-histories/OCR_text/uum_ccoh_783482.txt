BW Well, first of all I would like to know about what age were you when you decided to come to America?
MN Well, I was married before I came here, but I was real young I was seventeen years old, but I was to be eighteen the February after I came here in December, the month of December I was eighteen really, I was eighteen the February after, I should say that I was eighteen years old
BW So then both you and your husband came to America?
MN Well, John had been here before He was visiting, he was from the neighborhood, I didn't know him before at all, he went to visit his folks and we got
acquainted then. I was kind of--wanted to see this country and I decided to marry him and he wanted to marry me So the folks consented and we had a big wedding like they do you know, and we came here the day after we got married
BW Were you afraid to come here?
MN No, I wasn't afraid, but I worried an awful lot
after I was very lonesome and I didn't understand a word, not a word of English, and the food didn't--I didn't like the food here at all Now, coming here from New York on the train you know, he tried to get

 MARIE
NELSON # 1
me to eat, and sure I did little bit, soups and stuff like that, but all these pies and donuts and stuff I couldn't stand and they seemed so greasy to me, I didn't like them at all Then he came here and he went back to work at the sheep camp you know, and I was left alone in town He rented a small place out here and that's where I lived. I used to get very lonely and homesick
You wished that you could have gone back quite a few times?
Yes, many times, many times Yes, because I couldn't visit with anybody There was--Moyniers were here, I used to walk up there and visit them once in a while, but they were a little bit older and I don't know, they had their big family and that and I didn't know them too well I think Cances were living in Sunnyside already, I'm not sure I don't know what year they went up there, do you?
It was 1914 I think is what she said
No, I was here a little before
Really? She told me it was 1914 when she first came There were just very few French sheepmen here, I used to see some of them Glad, you're so happy when you see somebody from the old country, you're so happy, you know, just to visit with them and talk Now I'm

NELSON # 1
almost a pioneer in Price, Utah, and the town was just horrible Mud up to your neck, there was no sidewalks or anything, just a very small town it was Well, how did you get along with the other people, I mean, you didn't understand English and I'm sure that you didn't understand any of the other languages, so how did you get along with them?
You mean other foreigners?
Yes, like with the Greek immigrants or Italians
I never even spoke to them
You never did?
No, you know, I had a horror of Italians, Greeks, and all those people I didn't talk to them at all. Well, there wasn't this many then either, but there were a few more Italians than any other nationality I think at the time I came here there were Soon after I came here they started buying property on Main Street and it was almost an Italian street there for awhile, Silvanis, Engrosos, Larchis, and all that group, they were the big businessmen at that time Well, I tell you, I just had one of those books, part French and part English, you know I learned to talk English more with the little children than any others because I wasn't afraid to talk to them, they wouldn't laugh, and I would say, you know, "What do you call this?
3

 MARIE NELSON # 1
What's the name of this and that?" I used to like to go to shows, you learn an awful lot in the picture shows then, because everything was in writing you know, and I learned quite a bit from that Then I tried to take a corresponding course and I was doing really good, but that was later when I was beginning to have a family I couldn't follow it up too well because I had too much work
BW Well, your husband was working in the sheep industries, is that right?
MN Uhhuh
BW Did you ever go out there with him?
MN Oh yes We used to go up here when they were up
around Colton and there We used to go up or he'd come down, you know, but I worked up there You know, one time going up Price Canyon I remember that road was just terrible, and there used to be a fellow by the name of Jess Johnson and he'd run something like a taxi They didn't call it a taxi, you could hire him I cried going up that hill. Then from the car we had to walk up the hill, oh I don't know how much, maybe three or four miles
BW Were the wages--I'm sure they were--they were a lot different than then what they are now?
MN Well, I don't really know very much about them, but I
4

 MARIE
NELSON # 1
should say they were They are not near as much as they pay now Oh, you could buy my land, you could buy fifteen cents for a soup bone and make one for a pot of soup Soup bone with a lot of meat on and stuff you know I used to love ice cream when I first come here, I used to go down and get a dish of ice cream about every day I guess people thought that's all I ate because I never had any ice cream until I came to this country
Well, it was the foods that bothered you though, huh, it was what you ate?
Foods, uh huh Well, of course after I started cooking at home But then I didn't know the names of different things I was used to using or my mother was used to using in the old country and I couldn't buy all the seasoning that they use over there I could always use onions, but a lot of spices and things, you know, I know now, but at the time--then I started liking the country better and better and I wouldn't
BW
MN
want to live anywhere else now
BW You wouldn't want to go back to--?
MN Oh, I've been back a couple of times
BW But you wouldn't want to go back to live there again? MN Well, it gets under your skin after awhile If you
stay there about three months, you kind of like it,

 MARIE
BW
MN
NELSON # 1
it grows back into you, but it's so changed now It's
more like here over there all the time
Well, you know, the biggest thing in Carbon County is the coal mining and all of that industry What things happened around the time you were here, like the Number Two Mine disaster and things like that?
Oh yes, I went up to Castle Gate, you mean at Castle Gate, don't you?
BWá Uh h u h
I remember, I don't think I was here at the one at Scofield, what year was that, do you remember?
I'm not sure
That was the biggest they had, but then the one at Castle Gate, what year was that? 19--?
to Glen already, you see John died here, my first husband He died in an accident on the 19th of July in 1919 at the Pioneer Day rodeo. He got killed He was quite a good rider but then not good enough I guess Well yes, that was just horrible. I went up there with the American .Legion Auxiliary to work among the families gone on and oh, it was an awful situation to see They all thought you know, they find there's one alive and the other one's dead and
MN
BW MN
BW
MN No Yes, 1921 I think, or 1924 because I was married
1919 or 1920
6

 MARIE NELSON # 1
it's just terrible That's the saddest thing I saw happen here in this country
BW Did you have to work alongside different immigrants or did you just work with the Frenchmen?
MN Oh no, I worked the auxiliary, the American people mostly There wasn't very many French people that ever took an interest in outside affairs Exception,
they have their own families and they stayed home, there aren't too many right now. Mary Willard was very good She was like an American, she came here and she was very small and--well, she was raised in Price, she's my age, she helped me a lot with English too She's in town, by the way
BW Mary W illard?
MN Uh huh, do you know who she is? She's the mother of
Mitch Cowley and Marcella Holdaway Jeanselmes' girl she was, the oldest one in the family Uh huh They're from the Alps too, like the Moyniers
BW Well, you say you spent most of your time at your house in Price What did you usually do most of the time?
MN Cook and things like that Just talk with whoever you could, there was not much I could do I couldn't go to picture shows Well, I was only here, let's see, about two years until LaDell came, and after that I
7

 MARIE
BW MN
NELSON # 1
was fairly busy
Taking care of--
Yes, then John quit the sheep, you see He came down here and bought a little ranch out here across the river He ran that a few years and we had--then he bought another one up at what do they call that? Gordon Creek I think there is a Christmas tree farm on that place now, have you been up there?
Yes, I've been there before, it's a pretty place
Of course he wasn't there too long because we were married only, let's see, eight years when he got killed
How long was it before you married Mr Nelson?
Glenn? Two years after
And they were both involved in the sheep industry?
Oh no, I never knew Glenn for a long time I met Glenn, just like you are now, he came from France from the first World War, and he learned quite a bit of French and he wanted to talk French to somebody, and that's how I met him
Oh yeah?
Yes, he's been in the automobile game and he was a mechanic and all that type of men, you know, he didn't go for the stock business at all
What did you think of the government when you came to
BW MN
BW MN BW: MN

 MARIE NELSON # 1
the United States, it was quite a change, wasn't it?
MN Well, I really wasn't interested at all in it They told me what was what and I did what they said I thought some things were very funny Now like for instance I thought it was funny when the Prohibition came Not the people able to buy what they want You know, if they wanted wine with their meal they couldn't have it, you know, and stuff like that That after when you understand a country you become
Americanized, you understand those things a lot
better
BW: During the Prohibition did you ever know anybody that
was a bootlegger or something?
MN Oh, dozens of them
BW Oh really?
MN Sure, I wouldn't want to name all of them
BW Oh well, (Chuckle) you don't have to name them
MN Yes, uh huh, lots of them Lots of bootleggers
Everybody did some, either they were making home brew or you could buy grapes so cheap then, Bill, it doesn't pay anybody now to make wine at home you know They like better homemade wine, but it costs too much for grapes They had to haul them from California here you know Really the wine you can buy from California is better than anything you can make

yourself because it's all made in big wineries
They have better facilities
Oh sure
As you got more Americanized here, did you get into meeting more people?
Oh yes, I got interested in the American Legion Auxiliary quite a bit, I used to go to those meetings and enjoy them I still belong Then I got interested in business and catering business you know At first it was just with French people alone, and after, "Oh that's good and that's good and this is good and why don't you cook more for everybody and this and that," and I started in a catering business, and believe me, it's lots of work, I enjoyed it very much though.
Did you ever expect to find the streets lined with money in the United States as they would say?
Well, I didn't expect to have to work so hard for a good living I didn't--people work hard here, lots harder than they do in the Old Country But oh yes, the old country people have the habit of saying, "Oh
my goodness, I work so hard," and this and that They don't! They don't work hard at all They work long hours maybe because they work slow and they take lots of naps during the day to work, every afternoon everybody stops work over there Of course I'm from a
10

 MARIE NELSON # 1
farming community, I'm from the Pyrenees near the Spanish border
BW. So then when you came over here were you expecting to be in the farming?
MN Oh no, I thought it would be--no, I know that he wasn't a farmer, he never farmed, but he did go into farming some. But it isn't at all like over there, it's so different. You get up over there kind of early you know and you cook a big breakfast and they go to work At ten o'clock again, you bring them a little collation you know, a little bread and cheese and a glass of wine, and then at noon they eat and they quit work for awhile The afternoon before five o'clock you have to bring them another little bite to eat (that's the farmers I'm talking about) Then they work until about six o'clock and then they quit Then they had to take care of the chores, you know, the cows, sheep, pigs, and chickens to look after; they had to take care of them I'm talking the way I've been raised you know, I'm not raised in Paris or any other big cities It's the most beautiful place in
BW MN
the world, I hope when you go to France you go to the Pyrennes
I would like to
Just to see the countryside, it's beautiful, it's so

green and so much vegetation you know The houses are all practically white with red tiles, that's my home where I was born and raised and where my people still live
Oh really?
Yes, I had a little picture they sent me and Mrs Ray W alters painted that for me, from that little picture
That's where you used to live?
Yes
It's pretty
Yes and they have--the countryside is just beautiful over there, I hope you go someday
Yes, I would like to.
I'm sure you will, you will do anything you want to, Bill, you're doing real good.
Itry
I should say you're doing, you're trying your best Well, I really can't see why you would want to stay here after so beautiful a country place over there as what you lived in
Well, it's beautiful, yet people live well where I come from, there aren't very many poor people in that agriculture country But if you are standing still, I came here and I noticed how commercial, you know, how
12

 NELSON # 1
people were interested in making money, running here and running there and putting this and putting that, and I grew away from that being so tranquil, I just wanted to be more like the people here, more aggressive I wouldn't have gone back there at all if I couldn't show off that I had some money or made some money, because they expect everybody to have money here, that's how they are, they absolutely expect that I have a niece and nephew in San Francisco and they're doing very well, they're in the city though, and they buy property and make money They went back last year and they are going back again to see my brother (which is their father, my brother is their father) . But they like it here better because they make--but they work hard I have another niece that came from France to visit us last summer LaDell and I went to see her to San Francisco She didn't have time to come up here so we flew down there She was amazed how hard people work here, I know they do
They think it's an easy living?
streets (Chuckle)
BW Well, you'd better believe it
MN There is money here, lots of it, but especially now,
MARIE

 MARIE
BW MN
NELSON # 1
everybody has lots of money, Bill
Well, just about anybody does
Yes, except old people like myself, that is retired and on a fixed income, the times are going to be hard on them
BWá Well, things are changing pretty fast
MN Oh, isn't that awful? Maybe for the better, someday I
hope Well, you drive a truck, you've got a truck or
have you got a car?
BW Yes, I've got a truck right over here
MN Have you had that a long time?
BW No, I just got it a couple of years ago
MN Did you--we don't want to tell him about that do we? BW No
MN (Laughing) Well anyway, as I saw your mother with the
truck, this morning, how smart you know, I'm always looking for an old truck to have around here Fred has one but he don't like to take the top off We have so much stuff, you know trash in the backyard from all the ranchers who put their boxes and everything out there Do you know how old I am?
BW I couldn't guess, about sixty-eight?
MN Oh come on, you're a big flatterer, aren't you?
