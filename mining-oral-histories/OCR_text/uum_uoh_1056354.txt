  ROBERT BALDWIN Salt Lake City, Utah Tape No. 58
An interview by Mitch Haddard July 30, 1970
American West Center University of Utah Uranium History Series

 THE FOLLOWING I S AN INTERVIEW WITH ROBERT BALOW N CONDUCTED BY MITCH HADDAD AT THE CONTINENTAL BANK BUILDING IN SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, ON JULY 30, 1970.
[BEGINNING OF TAPE MISSING]
RB: --Utah. And after I graduated from high school, I
went into the service. And after returning from the service, I enrolled at the University of Utah and graduate from law school in 1952. Upon graduation I obtained employment with Utah Natural Gas Company, negotiating the purchase of rights of way for a natural gas pipeline which extended from the gas field in Carbon County, Utah to Orem, Utah. During that period of time I was employed by Utah Natural Gas Company, and I was asked if I wanted to transfer to the lease department of the El Paso Natural Gas Company, which was the parent company of the Utah Natural Gas Company, to be employed for the purpose of overseeing and be in charge of the oil and gas
interests of El Paso in the state of Utah. And after being with Utah Natural Gas for approximately seven months, I transferred to El Paso Natural Gas at El Paso, Texas, where I stayed for a year. And with the uranium boom, El Paso Natural Gas organized a subsidiary company known as Rare Metals Corporation of America for the purpose of obtaining mining interests primarily in the uranium field. And I was asked if I wanted to transfer to Salt Lake City to be

 ROBERT BALDWIN # 1
the chief land man for Rare Metals Corporation of America with regard to its mining endeavors. I accepted the transfer and transferred to Salt Lake City in August of 1955. I was employed by Rare Metals Corporation of America until 1961 when I left to go
into private practice, and I've been in private practice ever since.
MH: Now then you had dealings with legal aspects from both corporate and private practice side as well?
RB: More from the corporate than from the private. By 1961 the uranium industry was very much of the doldrums. The AEC had almost stopped all uranium from
new discoveries and there was very little new explorations. In fact, that's why Rare Metals Corporation of America folded shortly thereafter. And as a consequence, most of my practice was in a practical legal aspect when I was with Rare Metals Corporation of America. I've had very little practice in the mining field since leaving Rare Metals Corporation.
MH: Well, taking it from a corporate angle then, primarily what were some of the main problems with which you encountered while you were with Rare Metals?
RB: Of course, the main problem is always the discovery 2

 ROBERT BALDWIN # 1
of new minerals. My work primarily ánvolved negotiating contracts wi th property owners, exploration rights, and opti ons, and i n t he event that satisfactory discovery was obtai ned, negotiating
long term mining leases, preparing the leases, and negotiating the contracts with the Tribal Council of the Navajo Indian Reservation. We did have a uranium mill at Tuba City, Arizona and some quite extensive uranium deposits near Cameron, Arizona which require negotiations for mining rights and licenses from the tribe.
MH: This brings to mind an interesting question. When you're dealing legally with such a group as the Navajo Indians, they have certain, you know, tribal differences in law that you must go through first, and then you have to correlate them to our statutes. How much of a problem was this?
RB: The Navajo Indian Reservation does not pass laws itself except for the jurisdiction it has over the members of the tribe within the reservation. They
would require or set forth the amount of royalty or the rentals that would be paid, but they didn't affect the general mining laws of the United States at all.
MH: Then they are a fairly agreeable group in general,
3

 ROBERT BALDWIN # 1
except for the amount of royalty, rental, and terms, and the duration of your mining leases on the reservation. The royalty was quite high. It was higher than any other royalty.
RB: Uh huh.
MH: Then they were kind of a stubborn group when it came
to--
RB: Well, they're autonomous and they can set whatever
rates they want, and it's all matter of the law of supply and demand. The mining companies would compete with each other for rights within the Indian reservation, and so the tribal council would very
rightly and very justly negotiate the very best deal
available for the benefit of the tribe.
MH: Negotiation of contract brings to mind another
question. This was the problems which arose for, say, a large company like Metals Resources in obtaining mineral rights from miners. Now weren't there several areas that were quite sticky, I mean, attitude-wise as well as legally?
RB: No, your most difficult points of negotiations were always the amount of royalties or advance royalties to be paid, if any, the annual rentals, and whether or not the lessee mining company would have the right to terminate the agreement in the failure of title.
4

 ROBERT BALDWIN # 1
Usually these little miners wouldn't have any
evidence of title at all, nor would they have any sufficient plans to order abstracts of titles. So you just had to deliver whatever evidence they had. And then you would personally conduct the examination of the county records or obtain an abstract of the title based on your copies of the mining locations. And there would be a lot of times the mining title would
fail, and you would have to protect yourself. There would be no obligations to pay royalties or advance royalties or rentals in the event of failure of title. But the terms of the contract were generally the amount of royalty, the amount of rental, the time, and always that the mining companies would have right of termination. Oh, there was another thing too. You have to protect the miner in performing his assessment work and that would be a continuing obligation every year. And for that reason you would definitely want the right of termination so that after your initial exploration if you weren't interested in the deposit, you could terminate the agreement without being obligated to do the assessment work for lessor over a continuing period
of time.
MH: Now basically these regulations are controlled by the
5

 ROBERT BALDWIN # 1
Land Lease Act? Are there different--are there any specific statutes?
RB: No, the uranium mines have never been under the Mineral Leasing Act. The hardrock uranium mining has
I
always been under the general mining laws. See, in 1920 the federal government withdrew from the general mining laws or the gas exploration and development put under the general leasing act. You also have the potassium, phosphate, and potash, if my memory serves me correctly. Common types of minerals--sand and gravel is an example--have been withdrawn from general mining laws. But uranium has not been withdrawn and is still subject to these general
mining laws.
MH: These then are the basic laws of 1872, the Composite
Law of 1872?
RB: Right. Right. Which were developed from the Spanish
general mining laws, which were in force back in
California back in the 18--did you say 1842? MH: No, 1872.
RB: Right.
MH: The first part for the lode was 1866 and placer was
1870, and--
RB: And they were comparable to Spanish laws which, as I
said, were effective in California at the time of the 6

 ROBERT BALDWIN # 1
gold discoveries in California.
MH: Now the question comes when you're--when a miner 1s leasing a property from a--well, okay, when a lease is drawn up, the question then becomes sometimes that the miner decides that he wants to own the property, or he decides that the company wants to cancel the
lease, and the miner says that they can't. Is this usually pretty cut and dried in contract negotiations?
RB: Well, it should be cut and dried from the lessee standpoint. As I mentioned, that's one of the most important things in negotiation and mineral lease, and that's to make sure that the mining company has the right of termination in the event it doesn't want to further explore or exploit the property.
MH: Now you mentioned supply and demand. When a corporation is going out seeking new mining claims, you know, resources from the mining claims, how were the policies of various companies affected by economic demands? I mean, when the boom was on, there
was quite a fever, correct? And didn't this force companies to go into it a little more wholeheartedly than they normally would have? That type of throw caution to the wind is kind of what I'm getting to.
RB: Well, I think that's true. In the early days of 7

 ROBERT BALDWIN # 1
exploration-- (Interruption]
MH: Okay. Then, let's go back to the aspect of throwing caution to the wind in the boom and the legal problems that this would bring up.
RB: Well, I don't know about throwing caution to the wind, but in the early--about 1953, 1954 when there was such an impetus of exploration, of course, mining companies weren't nearly as selective as they are now. And almost any ---?--- at all would justify a cursory examination, maybe not in the exploration, but at least in the geological examination. And John Doe would locate some claims which might or might not have any merit, generally down on the Colorado Plateau. What he would do then is he would make a proposal(?) to six, maybe ten mining companies who
were active in the area stating the terms and the conditions that he would be willing to permit them to enter for exploration. We generally would not pay anything for the right to explore unless the claims really had some apparent substantial value. It was our contention that we were developing the property for the benefit of the claim owner and why should we pay for that. It was really more for his benefit so generally we would have a thirty-, sixty-, ninety-day right of exploration, or as long a period of time as
8

 ROBERT BALDWIN # 1
could be negotiated, and then the right to acquire a mining lease generally on the terms and conditions of a mining lease, attached as an exhibit to the option,
exploration option. There was quite a bit of competition in the early days among the companies for what might be--could have been conceivably the better claims in the better areas. Although nine times out of ten the claims didn't have sufficient merit to warrant anything other than an initial investigation.
MH: The amount of anti-trust litigation that came about as a result of the uranium boom leads to the question of competition oftentimes between the companies, and the relation of the small miner to the company in uranium mining. Now this was, as seen in decisions in certain cases, you know, a legal problem, which when litigated was often decided sometimes for the company, sometimes against it. How was this usually
handled?
RB: Well, I'm not aware of any anti-trust problems.
You're saying between the property owner and the
mining company?
MH: Well, the large companies would buy large blocks of
claims or lease large blocks of claims, and then they would sometimes fix prices or they would be able to set a price more or less. And the miners would have
9

 ROBERT BALDWIN #1
to conform to this price because this is where their source demand was. They were supplying for that demand, and often this led to unfair competition.
RB: I'm not familiar at all with these cases. Not at all. MH: I was just wondering from a corporate point of view.
Was this a concern or were the prices fairly fixed? RB: Well, most prices were fixed by the AEC. The AEC, of course, was the only buyer of uranium, so there
wasn't any anti-trust problem at all in those states. No price fixing by the company. They were established by statute.
MH: I was concerned because the AEC was known to have certain agents, you know, who bought quantities for the AEC, these agents oftentimes.
RB: W ell, the agents would be the m ills. The m ills would operate under contracts from the Atomic Energy Commission. And the Atomic Energy Commission would set the price that the mills would pay for the raw uranium.
MH: Well, as the boom dwindled more or less, how did this have an effect? I mean, say, when you shipped uranium for the making of the bomb, and then changed over eventually toward peacetime use, did this affect corporations?
RB: Well, eventually the AEC phased out the purchase of 10

 ROBERT BALDWIN # 1
new deposits and that was just the end of exploration then. Then existing deposits were mined out. A large number of the mills were closed because there was no more uranium available, and that really spelled the doom of the uranium industry as far as explorations were concerned in 1960, 1961.
MH: What was actually the extent to which the AEC really controlled the uranium industry? Was it quite--were they there like "Big Brother?"
RB: Well, they were originally, of course, because there was such a large demand for uranium that it was extremely easy to obtain all the cooperation from the AEC that you wanted, particularly in regard to the construction of the mills. Then as the AEC felt it had over-bought on all its uranium need, it became much more difficult to negotiate satisfactory conditions with the commission until finally the commission just announced it wasn't buying any new uranium.
MH: Also, too, this would bring to mind the question of the interior department would many times come into--- ?--- here in land. Or did the AEC have full jurisdiction in this area?
RB: Well, the interior department through the Bureau of Land Management have the right to regulate
11

 ROBERT BALDWIN #1
exploration and mining operations on lands within its jurisdiction. The AEC didn't have any land originally. I think originally it withdrew some areas from private exploration, but that would have to go back to 1950, 1951, and the AEC had opened those areas at the time I entered into the industry. The BLM and the forest service would have jurisdiction over some lands, but the AEC was the only buying agency of the federal government in uranium. We would always have to negotiate access routes and sometimes mining rights with the forest service and Bureau of Land Management, particularly where you were desirous of exploring in a withdrawn area in Idaho or Utah.
I have a question now dealing with mining law itself. The law in several places is fairly vague, and in other places is very strict. Now the prospectors oftentimes really didn't know the ramification of the mining law itself. So wouldn't this present a problem to companies who were leasing land from miners? Like if their claim was cross-claimed and if they found
out their claims was invalid and they had made a lease to you, wouldn't that sort of put you in a compromising position?
RB: Well, yes, in your initial negotiation you have the right, of course, to examine title and you generally
MH:
12

 ROBERT BALDWIN # 1
go out on the land and look for any adverse
locations, any intervening locations. And you just then have to make a decision whether the original location was strong enough to be sustained. And if it was, then you'd go along with the original. If it wasn't, then you'd negotiate some terms or conditions with the intervening locator, and perhaps have them enter into a joint venture together in order to secure title. But the location of mining claims has always presented a title problem. If as you say the mining laws are so, well, they're really not bad. The mining laws--for instance, a mining claim has to be
located on the ground so that its dimensions are easily ascertainable. That's the law. And in the states they have supplemented the federal mining laws by stating how you would locate on the ground so it could be ascertained. You have, for instance, a stake at least four inches in diameter and at least four feet high. Down in the Colorado Plateau it would be almost impossible for these little prospectors to carry that many stakes around with them, so they could use piles of rock instead. Some of the states provide for rock in lieu of stakes, but they would never be of the size or dimension required by the state laws. The general mining laws only require a
13

 ROBERT BALDWIN #1
substantial requirement or a substantial performance with the location requirements and claims. Consequently, I think in the years that I was in the mining business I don't think I examined one claim out of twenty, really, that was located properly. Six hundred feet by twelve hundred feet. The prospector would just pace it and he would think, well, this is almost six hundred feet. If it's oversized, of course, and there's an intervening locator, then you have to pull in your lines so that you don't exceed six hundred by fifteen hundred.
MH: Also too, this brings to mind another question. You mentioned that they would step it out, and this is a point which is brought up over and over again: that the claims are not actually measured accurately.
RB: It doesn't make any difference. As long as they're not oversized you could.
MH: But if they're undersized.
RB: It's all right. You can locate a mine four feet
square if you want to, but it just can't be over six
hundred by fifteen hundred.
MH: I have a question as to say a man located a claim
that was, say, 1450 feet and he had 50 feet more than he could have gone. If another man claimed that additional 50 feet, then there would be legally be no
14

 ROBERT BALDWIN # 1 dispute?
RB:
That's right. The later claim would pick up the f' ty feet. The problem is where a locator locates a succession of, say, five claims in a row and he thinks he's six hundred feet wide when really he's seven hundred feet wide. So he has claimed a succession of claims in excess of the legal, maximum size. And then somebody would come and locate claims all over the top of them to pick up the gaps between these claims which they could arrive at by requiring him to pull in his lines so that he didn't have anything over six hundred by fifteen .hundred feet. And that could be done. There is a lot of that.
It seems then that there would be a lot of litigation in this? You know, the more conflict the more litigation would end up having to come away from it.
MH:
RB: Well, there were thousand and thousands of conflicts in mining claims located on the Colorado Plateau, but not a great deal of litigation because the claims
didn't have a great deal of value to justify litigation. Usually what you'd do, you'd explore that conflict, and if there is no uranium there, if there is no mineralization there, there is no legal problem. The old saying in the oil and gas industry is that a dry hole always cures the title, and that
15

 ROBERT BALDWIN #1
is what happened in uranium industry. Occasionally
when you find a mineral, then you have to take a long hard look and your title problems, and you have to relocate, pull in your lines if somebody was on top of you. If they had valid locations, then you would have to concede to them some of the area. But realize, too, that the first requisite of a mining claim is discovery. And you can't rely on somebody else's discovery, so you'd go out and you'd explore a block of claims, and you'd have a discovery that the people over you wouldn't have discovered. Then they don't have any title at all. They have a location, but they don't have any title.
MH: The discovery--
RB: --relates back to the date of discovery, and you
would have valid location and he wouldn't. That was the problem of the subsequent locators down in the Grants, New Mexico area and the Ambrosia Lake area where your uranium deposits were five hundred, a thousand feet deep. You'd have multiple claims, but only a certain number of them could afford to explore to that depth to discover mineralization. And once you've discovered it, you would have a valid
location, even though there would be subsequent ones. MH: Uh huh. Well, this is a problem today, right? I mean,
16

 ROBERT BALDWIN # 1
if you were to make a uranium claim work today,
sometimes they have to go down almost three thousand
feet. RB: Right.
MH: So this is what they face? The man who really works is pedis possessio in some parts? The actual working of your claims oftentimes possession?
RB: Yeah, but how is somebody actually going to work a claim with mineralization that's down a thousand feet? Say the little locator comes in first and he locates his claim. All right, how's he going to protect himself with the doctrine pedis possessio? He actually has to be working the claim and diligently
prosecuting the discovery of mineralization during the period of time that he's protected. And if he doesn't have a drill rig in there, how's he going to work the claim with the mineralization if there is any a thousand feet deep? So the big locator just moves in on top of him during his absence, and during the period of time that he isn't protected by the doctrine, and puts a rig down in and gets a discovery if there is any mineralization. They then have paramount prior title.
MH: Well, this is--I was always under the impression that oftentimes the locator [would make his claim], the
17

 ROBERT BALDWIN # 1
locator's claim, then he would go to the big companies for a lease, and they would be able to develop it.
RB: Well, that was the ideal way, yes.
MH: Uh huh. But oftentimes in practice it did not work? RB: A lot of times the little guy would say, "I want five
thousand dollars a claim," and he doesn't have any discovery. The temptation is very great for the big operator just to move in on top of him, overstake him, and obtain his own discovery. That's done many times. But the courts generally throughout the history of the mining laws tended to favor the little guy who's in there first. And there are cases after cases of incomplete discover, generally inadequate, incomplete location, I should say, and inadequate discovery where the little guy's been protected. Intent of the law originally in the western United States was to encourage the man with the burro to go out and locate the minerals. And in a sense, the general laws still favor the little guy who comes in first even though he may not have perfected his
title.
MH: Uh huh. This again is derived from the Spanish?
RB: That's right.
MH: It was originally a royal type thing to promote
18

 ROBERT BALDWIN #1
people to go out and explore.
RB: That's right.
MH: So they gave him compensation. So this is how the
government--well, this brings to mind another question now. The Colorado Plateau is uniquely absent of the use of violence. I mean, if you go over all the records you find there's really not many notices of violent action comparing it to the California Gold Rush of 1849. And yet there is presence of quite a bit of court action. This would lead to the question: is there a possibility that people sought to go to the courts and use the courts which were there and well established, rather just settle the matter themselves?
RB: Well, I think that's true. You go back to the Spanish days in California. Self-help was really the only method of help the people had. Those were your first mining districts organized, and you would have the trustees of the district who would eventually settle claims. And you had your first legal process in California, where a miner who was jumped didn't have to pull a gun to force the guy off. He could then go
to the district and prevail upon the district to recognize his prior legal rights, and the district then would enforce his rights. Of course, we're much
19

 ROBERT BALDWIN #1
more civilized today. That's why we're going to the
courts instead of self-help. But there was some violence on the plateau. I remember there was a killing at the Rattlesnake Mine where there was two locators and one shot the other. I think that's the only fatality that I can recall during those days. But I imagine there were a lot of bloody noses and head wounds from pickaxes, you know, that would never reach the press or received any notoriety.
MH: Then, too, in the courts in Salt Lake City, you had, for example, two judges, two federal judges on the bench who have á quite a knowledge on litigation of uranium mining cases. Both men seem very knowledgeable in that particular area, and it seems
like they've had a lot of cases before them.
RB: Well, it's been a big industry. There have been a lot of mining law cases for the last 150 years here in
the western United States. And, of course, the more exploration and the more impetus you have in the mining industry, the more chances for litigation you're going to have. As a consequence there has been a great deal of litigation arising out of the uranium boom here in the Colorado Plateau and the western
United States.
MH: I have a question here in regards to the security or
20

 ROBERT BALDWIN #1
stock angle, also corporate. Now you were associat with apparently one of the large ones. They had a solid backing and they were a subsidiary of a good company. Now it would be obvious that the stock from this company would, in regards to uranium, be probably a bluechip type stock? I mean, you know, it was a good solid stock. But what about some of the
smaller ones? Uranium or different other types of stocks? How did they get away with doing what they did?
RB: Well, these were promotional companies, and mining claims are property rights, and the organizers or promoters would contribute mining claims to the corporation in exchange for stock and then go to the
public for the sale of stock. The public at that time was so enamored with making money in the uranium area that they could sell almost anything. It wasn't until, oh, maybe '55 or '56 that the states Securities Commission required stock that was issued for the exchange of mining claims to a corporation would have to be placed in escrow. The promoters' stock was then placed in escrow, and the escrow would provide that the stock couldn't be released until the corporation had certain earnings or certain dividends were paid to the uranium shareholders. And by so
21

 ROBERT BALDWIN #1
doing, the securities commission made it much more difficult to put these floating companies on the market. But there was a lot of it. A lot of it. Boy, there were companies that came out that didn't have any assets at all, and you could obtain almost any kind of a geologist's report stating that in the
opinion of the geologist there could be valuable mineralization. Any geologist could say that.
There were estimates rather than actual--
MH:
RB: And the public was buying it on the greatest sucker
theory which was that you would buy on the theory that there would always be another sucker down the street who would pay more for the stock than you paid for it. And there were fortunes made. But of course, it was really akin to a chain-letter situation, in that for every dollar that was made, somebody had to lose a dollar somewhere down the line, because the companies never earned anything. So if you made a dollar on your stock and sold it to John Doe, John Doe is either going to lose that dollar or he might sell it and make another dollar, but eventually somebody's going to lose. And in the later years of the industry after the public became more wary of buying penny uranium stocks, the people that held the longest really lost their shirts. People that bought
22

 ROBERT BALDWIN # 1
early and sold early made a lot of money, and th money that they made was eventually lost by somebody.
MH: Uh huh. Well, this brings another question then. You said that oftentimes companies had land men. I mean, like they were going in and they had men actually out in the field claiming for the companies. There were claims that were actually company claims?
RB: Right.
MH: Now when you secured these claims, they were
RB:
basically unpatented mining claims. They were claims which you were to do a certain amount of assessment work in order to keep that claim, and as long as you did that, you were okay. Now this brings the question of securing the patent. How common was it to secure a patent during this time by companies? Did they want
it or did they just seek to leave them as unpatented and produce them?
Oh, generally you wouldn't patent your mining claims. If you had a deposit of so many thousand tons of
marketable uranium, you just go ahead and mine it out and that would be the end of it. We never patented any mines at Rare Metals Corporation. We never felt any justification for it. And really the only benefit of patenting--well, there are two benefits really: one is that it waives the requirement for future
23

 ROBERT BALDWIN #1
assessment work, and the second is that we do have a more secure title.
And you have a fee title?
You have a fee title, but down on the Colorado
MH: RB:
MH: RB: MH:
RB:
Plateau, the fee title didn't do you any good for development other than the mining. And if you were in possession and actually mining, why patent? Why patent it? You have to have a mineral survey. You have to make application for patent. You have to actually buy it. Buy the acreage from the federal government when--under a mining location, it doesn't cost you anything.
So then it wasn't very common at all?
No, it wasn't very common.
I'm curious because today to get a patent it's so hard. It's a muddled process from what I understand.
A long involved process.
Well, today you have to prove a marketable discovery, and really the law, the mining law has never required a marketable discovery. This now is a new interpretation by the Supreme Court. The Department of the Interior.
MH: Wasn't á it though primarily based on Coleman versus the Supreme Court?
RB: I'm not familiar with the case, but the requirement 24

 ROBERT BALDWIN # 1
came about as a result of the big land grabs on the strip down in Las Vegas. The gravel deposits, mile after mile of gravel deposits right along the side of the highway leaving Las Vegas to Los Angeles. And,
oh, I don't know when it was, mid-fifties, I guess, but the land developers patented large numbers of placer mining claims based on gravel discovery, and the gravel, of course, was not marketable. There was no market for gravel in that area, but the government nevertheless issued patents. After that and because
of the bad odor that arose from it, the new requirement was instituted. You had to have a marketable discovery. And that's particularly true too in the, oh, in resort areas and mountain areas where the claims would have value for recreational development rather than for the mineral discovery. You would have to prove to the satisfaction of the Department of the Interior a valid mineral discovery, an actual intent to mine, and consequently, it became more difficult. But you can still patent it if you have a valuable mineral discovery. But if you're in a recreation area, the government takes a longer look
at it and makes it more difficult.
MH: And then here's a kind of a final question. In
regards to civil pressures. I guess they're more 25

 ROBERT BALDWIN #1
prominent now than they were at the time you were with Rare Metals Resources. But pressures such as conservation, ecology, the aspect of mining hurting the land, and things like this Public Land Law Review Commission, and the recommendations they make there
for reclamation of mining claims after they cease to produce. How big of a problem was this then or could it be now to both the company and legally for the company?
RB: It wasn't nearly as big a problem then as it is now. Of course, there's the patriotic aspect of uranium in the early days. The government and the public look the other way on a lot of these conservation things because the government very desperately needed uranium. The only problems we had on conservation was we located some mining claims in a recreation area in Idaho. The mining claims were valid because the area had not been withdrawn from location, but the forest service had jurisdiction over whether or not motorized vehicles could enter the area. So we had these valid mining claims, but we couldn't get a permit to bring a motorized vehicle into for exploration. We could walk in. We could do all of the
hand exploration on geology we wanted, but we never were able to obtain the right to take a motorized
26

 ROBERT BALDWIN #1
vehicle into the area. So that really was the first time I have encountered conservationists. And I'm
certain from what I read in the paper that it's much more pronounced today. In fact, some rnajor company just recently had to relinquish some claims because of some ecological problems. The fact that there is a surplus of---?--- in the United States today didn't provide any pressure against the conservationalists to perrnit them to operate these claims . Now that ' s different from the old uranium days. Uranium was very much in demand, and consequently you didn't have the
pressure against you.
MH: Because I was wondering, you know, for example, you
look out here and you see the Kennecott Mills. I know there's quite a bit of sentiment regarding, you know, the haze that they emit and different other things like that.
MH: It would seem that the mining laws are eventually going to be subject to pressure.
RB: Oh, no doubt about it. And probably for the better. The country--it' s interesting about that Kennecott smoke. It's been here now since 1909 and the people are just now looking at it, just now noticing it. It's just a matter of public awareness and public concern about the ecology in the country. But you're
27

 ROBERT BALDWIN #1
correct. It's going to become more difficult all the time for new mining ventures to be undertaken in the United States because mining by its very necessity means pollution, spoilation. On any mining claim you have you're going to have some kind of a mill; either
a mill or a smelter. And a mill means tailings and a
smelter means smoke. No way you can get around it.
MH: So then I'm curious because in essence, though, it has to be Congress that enacts--Congress will have to enact or change the law which has been in since 1872,
and that leads to the question: are the mining laws a
little bit antiquated in many ways?
RB: Oh, they are antiquated. There's been a lot of
movement under way for years to require leasing rather than location in all mineral rights with some type of central filings, probably from the federal land office, the Bureau of Land Management. The way it is now, you have the federal government on the
withdrawn minerals and the leasing act, and the state, of course, on its minerals. The public domain is still governed to some extent by the recordings in the county recorder's office of the county in which the minerals area located in. Of course, it used to be the mining districts which as well required separate bodies. But really it should be centralized.

Probably under the entire jurisdiction of the Bur u of Land Management. That would be my recommendation.
MH: Do you think this will come about then in the near future or--?
RB: Well, I thought it probably would be back in the uranium days, and they weren't successful then. I don't know if there's any real movement under way to modernize the general mining laws or not.
MH: Well, you know, there are several agencies which are trying to--I mean, the Bureau of Land Management is one agency that has to listen to it, and your Public Land Law Review Commission was set up to draw up regulations or draw up recommendations and, what, the Mineral Congress? Or is there a--
RB: Mining Congress?
MH: Mining Congress which, you know, present legal
opinions as to what should be done. I guess because ultimately power lies in the federal government over all mining lands due the Constitution. The section which says that the federal government shall dispose of public land in any way it sees fit. That's a broad--! mean, you know, they can really do anything they want. I'm just wondering just how far could they
go if they wanted to change it.
RB: Well, Congress can do anything it wants in regard to

general mining laws as long as the laws remain vested
in the federal government. But it's so difficult to change. These laws are now 150 old, and you have you western states that are ingrained with the mining laws. And, of course, once you change the mining laws, you're going to start exacting fees. Right now you or I could go out anywhere on the public domain on any withdrawn lands and locate mining claims and it doesn't cost us a cent except our own time and effort. There are no fees, there are no royalties, no rental paid to the federal government. And that is so ingrained into the western way of thinking, I think it would be difficult to for Congress to change it.
MH: Uh huh. Just as a final question, is there anything you would like to add or any areas that you think we've missed in regards to the problems in regards to mining law and important areas dealing with corporation or dealings with uranium?
RB: No, I don't think so. It was a very interesting facet of my life I enjoyed it very much. And I hope someday that there will be the same type of mining boom that we had in the fifties in the uranium industry. Very fascinating and very interesting. But unless you have any other question, I don't have anything else to say.
