 THIS IS AN INTERVIEW WITH MR. REMO SPIGARELLI, ON MAY 5, 1982, IN CARBONVILLE, UTAH. THE INTERVIEWER IS NANCY TANIGUCHI. THIS IS FOR THE CARBON COUNTY COAL MINE HISTORY PROJECT.
NT:
Mr. Spigarelli is a lifelong resident of Carbon County having been born in 1912 in Black Hawk, which is now known as the coal camp Hiawatha. He worked at both Hiawatha and Mohrland. Well I'm doing this for the American West Center at the University of Utah, and it's a whole project on coal mining that we're trying to get more information on, because you know there has been so little done, on Carbon County, in history. We are just t r ying to keep up with everything.
Now you wrote down that you were born in Black Hawk, right .
Y es.
On October 4, 1912?
1912 Nancy, yes.
Why were your par ents i n Black Hawk?
My father was a coal miner.
Yes.
He worked in the mine. He was one of the first to start what they call the King 1 Port al. He worked ther e and did t his wor k, mostly with wheel barrow and hand work, pick and shovel to open that portal. Of course later on he got into the mine, and t hi s was in the ear ly t eens, there
just before 1912 around 1911 and that. Yes . Where did your parents come f rom?
RS: NT: RS: NT: RS: NT: RS:
NT :

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
RS: Italy.
NT: Which part?
RS: My mother, both of them came from what they call Perugia,
Italy.
NT: Where is that?
RS: Oh it would be some distance north of Rome. NT : Y e s .
RS: Between north and Milan.
NT: When did they come over?
RS: My dad was over here, he must have come over here in 1904, and my mother followed. They didn't know each other there.
NT : Y e s .
RS: They met in Kansas .
NT: Oh really?
RS: Pittsburgh, Kansas, yes. He was working the coal mines,
and my mother came over with her mother and stepfather,
and they got married there in Pi ttsbur gh, Kansas in 1906. NT: Yes.
RS :
NT: RS:
But my father had already been her e in Scofield and Clearcreek prior to that .
Oh!
And then he went back to Kansas, and then that's where he met my mother, and then they come back here in 1907 and - --?---

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT: Do you happen to know when your father came over, if he had originally planned to come to Utah?
RS: No, these were just kind of scouting around you know, at that time, I guess, wherever, they could find a job through their friends and connections like that. That's how they came here, and my mother she is still alive, and she will be, if God's willing, 99 come September.
NT: Oh, my heavens!
RS: She lives here in Price.
NT: Oh that's fantastic.
RS: Yes. She requires a lot of help now, of course, but she
is at home. I have two, three sisters, real lovely sisters, they really take good are of her. We all help where we can.
NT: Yes, how many other, do you have an brothers?
RS: I had one brother and he was killed in a mine accident in
1941, at Hiawatha. The portal my dad opened. NT: Oh, gee.
RS: Ain't that a coincidence? He was run over with a mine locomotive on January the 14th, 1941. A man about 26 years old then .
NT: Oh, that's too bad.
RS: Oh yes a young man. The only brother I had.
NT: When your dad came over here, did he already know how to
mine coal?
3

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
RS: No I don't think so. I think they would come off a little farm, back there in Italy. If they had a farm, I don't know if they, in those days when sons or daughter got married, if they would all live with the parents. They
would keep adding on. That is how they lived then. They
lived off what little piece of ground they had. NT: Yes.
RS: That's the way they done it.
NT: Oh, and then your mom's family, why [they] come to
Kansas?
RS: They had some connections there, some people that knew
them, you know. NT: Yes.
RS: That is where my mother met my dad and they got married. NT: What was your mother's maiden name?
RS: V ellucci. V -e-1-1-u-c-c-i. Marie V ellucci. And my name was Cecil, S-i-s-t-o.
dad's
NT: Was he the sixth kid?
RS: He what?
NT: Sixth kid?
RS: No. I understand there were about twelve of them in that
family. And he was the youngest, one of the youngest. NT: Huh.
RS: I don't remember my dad at all Nancy, he got killed, in a horse and buggy accident. After, here in about 1912. I
4

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
was six months old, and someone turned him in that he affiliated with the United Mine workers back in Kansas, and the superintendent asked him to leave.
NT: Oh sure.
RS: They didn't have a organization here at that time. That
was a no-no I guess in those days and they asked them to leave, so they had to leave town. My mom said they carried me out. I was six months old, and my little sister was a little older than I. They opened up a little baker shop here, on 1st North.
NT: In Price?
RS: Yes, right across the street from the Sumner Apartments
in that old house. That house is still there, but the
little baker shop is torn down. NT: Yes.
RS: Sixty-eight years ago, March, or April 27th my dad died, got killed. I was about fifteen months old when that happened so I don't even remember my ---?--- dad.
NT: What did your mom do after your dad died?
RS: [sic] She was pregnant with this boy, Hilt . He was born
in July, three months later or so.
NT: Well how did she support you all?
RS: Well, my uncle was here at that time, and his family, and
they lived Scofield. NT : Ye s .
5

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
RS: Mom went back up there to Scofield and lived with them until the baby was born. Then [we] had a cousin here that was working over in Mohrland, so he said for her to come with him, and keep house for him while she got something straight. In 1915, I guess she got married, remarried.
NT: Yes.
RS: For the second time, and she had, I have three [siblings]
I had three half sisters NT: Yes.
RS: One died.
NT: Yes. What was the name of your uncle in Scofield?
RS: His name was Ferdinand.
NT: Spigarelli?
RS: Yes, he was my dad's brother.
NT: Yes, and what was the name of your cousin in Mohrland? RS: A tillio, A tillio Spigarelli.
NT: Yes.
RS: And, and he was the one that had my mother come over
there with us, two children, then, or three children after Sisto was born, a they called him Sisto, but they Ameri cani zed it to Cecil.
NT: I see. And then what's your stepfather's name? RS: Pete Badage. He is dead and gone now.
NT: When did he die?
RS: In 1954, in May of 1954.
6

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT: So he wasn't Italian?
RS: Well, he was born in what they call a, ---?---, Austria,
right on the border line they tell me. My sisters went back there and saw where he was born and, and met his brothers and sisters, and we were back there in, let ' s see, I can't even remember when that was, in was in the late fifties though. After he died.
languages fluently , yes.
NT: Goll that's good.
RS: He worked in the coal mines all his life also.
NT: Yes. So you were raised out there in, well did she, knew
him in Mohrland?
RS: Yes. He came and boarded with them. He was boarding
somewhere right near, and then when they got married he
came with the family, you know, with the cousin and that. NT: I see.
RS: That's how that worked.
NT: Yes, so you grew up in Mohrland?
RS: Mohrland, and Price, Mohrland, Hiawatha, and down here.
So, I been, I'm a native. NT: Yes .
RS : Born and r aised right here.
NT: Now it sounds like your family moved around a bit.

Did he speak Italian?
NT :
RS: Italian, German and Austrian. He could talk three

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
RS:
NT: RS:
NT: RS:
NT: RS:
NT: RS: NT: RS:
NT: RS: NT:
Yes in the camps, you know, from one camp to the other one and, and then Mohrland shut down. Well lets see, after my dad got killed my mother lived in Mohrland. Then about 1916 and 1917, we were still in Mohrland, and then they came to Price--
Y es.
--And lived on the farm for awhile. Then we went back to
Mohrland, about 1923.
Yes.
Then about 1925, Mohrland shut down, and we went over to west Hiawatha.
Yes.
Then west Hiawatha shut down in 1926, and we went back to Mohrland, and about that time, in 1929 I started to work in Mohrland.
I see.
I was just a young fellow when I started work.
Y es.
We lived quite a rough old life. About that time was when my stepfather decided to leave because he figured I was old enough to go to work and my mother wanted me to go to school you know.
Y es.
It was rough times in the late 1920s. Ye s .

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
RS: He just pulled out, left us, and he came down to Price. So I got a job!
NT: What was he doing down here in Price?
RS: He quit Mohrland and worked over to Wattis, and we had a
little farm, a little garden spot down here. NT: In Price?
RS: Yes. Where my mother lives now. We lived there for a long time.
NT: I see.
RS: Yes. And then I started to work in 1929 at Mohrland. I
was sole supporter of this family, seven of us. My mother
six children, and myself.
NT: That is a heck of a responsibility for a young guy.
RS: Oh gee, Nancy that was tough you know, just barely
sixteen. It was tough to get a job in those days you know. I guess the superintendent felt badly and, gave me a job.
NT: What kind of job did you get then?
RS: I got a job on the outside, on the tipple picking bony.
Very cold, miserable, and then I worked in the mine, --- ?--- then I shoveled coal for 50 cents a ton.
NT: Ah.
RS; But t hey didn't work everyday. That was a problem because
even at those rates you could a make a nice living if they had worked mor e days. They worked two and thr ee days
9

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
a week or less than that!
NT: Was that during winter or summer?
RS: Summer mostly.
NT: Yes.
RS: And some summers, we only worked one day 1n two months,
Nancy. NT: Goll.
RS: They would alternate with Hiawatha. We would work one month and Mohrland would shut down. Hiawatha would probably get two or three days in a month, and then they would shut Hiawatha down and Mohrland would work and we'd get one day or two, so. That was in the 1930s and all. It was rough.
NT: How did you eat?
RS: Well I don't know! I can show you a couple of statements
that I had from 1934, Nancy.
NT: I'd like to see them.
RS: I'll tell you what this is two months of pay here. You
can see how they charged, Nancy. NT: Lets see here.
RS: This is April, 1934.
NT: Yes.
RS: Okay, we didn't work March.
NT: Yes.
RS: So you see the medical department was a dollar and a
10

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
half, but they took off three dollars, and the rent of
course was ten bucks! NT: Yes.
RS: Then there is ten more dollars, because it didn't pay for March .
NT: Right .
RS: (Showing NT the statement) The Welfare Association was a
dollar a month. That is the store, $27.03 , and our union dues were $3.00. I made a total of $55.03, and my take horne pay was 54 cents, for two months!
NT: Oh, gee!
RS: Here are the hours. There are twenty seven-hours at 57
cents plus, twenty two at 64 cents, and thirty eight at
68 cents, and total.
NT: That's the total. Goll that's amazing. Why do you have
different hourly rates here?
RS: They had different classifications.
NT: For jobs you mean, you wor ked differ ent jobs.
RS: Yes.
NT: I see.
RS: The rate that's 68 cents an hour, at the high rate there. NT: Yes!
RS: I've got as low as 44 cents an hour!
NT: Oh man!
RS: Three dollars and fifty-two cents for eight hours Nancy,
11

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
and then they run coal, maybe sixteen, eighteen hours, and you still got forty-four cents an hour, and they'd say, 11 Don't you get time and a half? 11 I never heard the term, time and a half. It was straight time, so.
NT: Yes.
RS: Then after you work all those hours, they call it a
clean-up system, they ran everything out of the mine, and
the next day we would be idle, maybe two or three days. NT: Yes.
RS: The mines would be loading their coal, you know, getting it all loaded, so we, make a big run, that's the way they worked , those days.
NT: Oh my goodness! How many tons could you load in a day? RS: W ell--
NT: With a pick and shovel?
RS: Well, it wasn't too much of an effort to load fifteen
tons. It was already cut for us. NT: Yes.
RS: We had to pay for the powder and shooting. We would load fifteen tons, quite easily. But the problem there is they would only let you have three cars. If you would really chunk them up and got them built up pretty good, you could give tons on there. And it would take about, we could do it within six hours, six and a half hours.
NT: Yes .
12

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
JS:
NT: JS: NT:
JS: NT: JS: NT:
JS: NT: JS: NT: JS:
NT: JS :
We begged for another car, and the boss would say, "Oh God! We can't." He said, "The motorman and nipper that were bringing in the cars, are getting $5.28 a day." They were furious you know, because we could beat them in less time .
Sure.
But we worked harder.
Yes. Were you all members of the same union, you and the motorman and the nipper?
Yes, but at that time it was before the union came in. Oh.
The 1930's see?
Yes. Well that's something I wanted to ask you about, is the union. It sounds like from what you told me, that you were in Price here on the farm when the strike of twenty- two came along is that right?
Yes. My father, stepfather was down here, yes.
How did the strike affect you in Price?
Tough!
Didit?
It was tough, yes, because he'd been working, and he'd stay up in the camps and he'd come home you know, when we was living with him down here.
Yes.
And it was tough , and then we didn't have nothing t o go
13

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
on you know. We potatoes, and home made stuff in the
garden. NT: Yes .
JS: Never bought a loaf of bread, as long as I remember. My mother always made bread once a week.
NT: Y es.
JS: Good bread too! My father looked like this!
NT: That's okay, you're healthy. So then your mom, you and
the other kids ran the farm here in Price?
JS: In this garden spot was all we had, here in Price. Yes. NT: And then your stepfather used to come down from the mines
and bring his wages? JS: Yes.
NT: Did he come home with fifty-four cents?
JS: Sometimes less than that poor guy, you know it was rough,
Nancy.
NT: Yes. Well during the strike of 1922 did you have any of
the miners staying at your place when they were off camp? JS: No, we didn't have them stay in our place, but they were connected with a lot of them that were out of work and hanging around in these other farms down there were. The grist mill used to be, you know, that cement company down there is some Italian people and then several people down
there, some over in Emery County, working on the farms, doing the best they could.
14

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT: Did you have to feed anybody besides you know, just the family, with what you were producing?
JS: No, that's about it.
NT: Did you ever try to go into the camps, during the strike? JS: At that time I did, see I was just a young kid.
NT: Yes, sure.
JS: These people, they couldn't go in there you know, because
they walked out and they wouldn't allow them in, you know
until the things settled down.
NT: Yes. Did you sell any of your produce? Peddle it.
JS: My stepfather did for a while.
NT: Didhe?
JS: Yes and he was selling stuff and did a little bootleggi-
ng' on the side!
NT: Where did he sell it, just all the camps around here? RS: Yes, he would go up to Wattis and over to Mohrland, and
up here in Kenilsworth. He would go up in there, and he had connections, friends you know. They used to be pretty crafty little people I'm telling you! Yes, there in west Hiawatha I remember my mother used to make home brew.
NT: Yes.
RS: That is where they are running their coal now, from
Hiawatha. We lived right in town and this was about in 1925, when Mohrland ---?--- and right across the street from our house was the Finn Boarding House. They had
15

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
sleeping quarters and then where they had their meals. they would come right through the back door and stop and get a shot of whiskey and a bottle of beer, still dirty, and go right on through the front door! What we had was a duplex, a two story house there and we had two rooms on the bottom and two rooms upstairs, the living room and the kitchen were on the bottom floor and two bedrooms upstairs, that's---?--- we'd come right through the door and the men would say, "Okay, see you later." They would go and eat and then they'd come back and have a couple more beers and that is how my mother made a living. She washed clothes by hand,! a lot of them.
NT: Gee!
JS: Then I remember the first washer she got was what they
called a one minute washer, had a wooden tub! NT: Ooh!
JS: But it was electrified! Didn't have to use that lever, I used one of those, but my mother didn't have one of those, I used to do that for a lady down here, and we'd get the water out of the canal, and strain it through some cement sacks, and had a the fire outside and heat the water out there and put in this thing, my job was to keep this going, back and forth. Get a nickel all day!
NT: You helped earn money, didn't you? JS: Oh yes.
16

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT: What made your folks decide to start the bakery? JS: Well that's when he was asked to leave Hiawatha.
NT: Because JS: Y es.
NT: But why JS: Well, I NT: Yes.
of his union affiliation.
a bakery, why not a farm?
guess that was his line of work.
JS: He had a partner that was a real good baker, and he was just learning most of it, you know.
NT: Who was his partner?
JS: NT: JS:
NT: JS:
I don't remember the name. Oh that's okay.
I don ' t even remember the name, and he delivered bread in his house, to this house.
Did he really?
Yes. In 1914, he would go past here with his buggy and, a little horse and he was killed right up here, where that pump station is, where they used to pump that water up to Kenilsworth.
Yes.
frightened from a train that was going by, lunged over this bridge and took the cart, buggy and him. This fellow that was with him, this fellow wasn't his partner, but he was with him and his name was Joe Ozella.
17
NT:
JS: Across a little bridge there, they say the horse got

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT: Yes.
JS: He lived in that house I'm telling you about.
NT: Yes, I see. Then when your step-father was taking the
stuff up to Hiawatha and Kenilsworth, did he use horse
and buggy too?
JS: Yes, he had one horse and a little buggy, and it would
take him a couple of days to make the trip you know!
NT: Sure i t would . Sure. That's interesting, well then when the union finally did come in here, you were already
working weren ' t you?
JS: Yes, for the union, I started in 1929, the union come in
1933 Nancy, which was a godsend to us--to me. You know John L. Lewis is next to God, I'd say! And of course at that time I didn't know nothing about, organization or anything, but this is one of the first letters they had here.
NT: All right!
JS: Yes, and there is Nicholas Fontachio, the organizer that
came out here in 1933.
NT: Huh, did you meet with him?
JS: Oh yes. Mr. Frank Bonacci, he was quite an organizer
also, at that time. See t his was back in 1933 . You can tell how they [sic] worked on this thing to get started. After it got started it wasn't all union. We had to abide by the rules and you couldn't come out and demand a lot .
18

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT:
JS:
NT: JS:
NT: JS:
One time we got a fifty cent day raise, a day! Fifty cents, and we thought, boy we're really moving!
I'll bet, at that rate! Well how did you first hear about the union, for the very first time?
My first time? Well my mother would tell me when I was a little boy how my dad was let out because of the union, but she didn't know too much about it ---?--- you know, but it was a no-no.
Y es.
---?--- in this area, and when they started out when I started getting some information.
Yes.
Anyway we would talk about it there, and you know and ---
?--- I'd never ever reveal this to anyone. I haven't to this day, but this one, a supervisor , a real nice guy, he told me, he said, "I'll tell you, you'll be better off belonging to the union than without it." He said, "Of course, I can't say what I feel, because, i t ' s a no-no . " But, he said, "We're not stupid enough to know that organization isn't the best thing at that time."
That's amazing that a supervisor would say that!
Yes. you bet, but this was a secret, and it still is, I would never repeat his name, and I respected him to this day and he 's dead and gone and ever ything.
NT: JS:
NT: Was he from around here? 19

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
JS: He was from Mohrland.
NT: Yes, but was he a local fellow, or had he been involved
with unions elsewhere?
JS: Probably so, he was an older man and he had been around. NT: Had he been a miner before he was a superintendent?
JS: Yes. I guess before 1922 they had a union here and then
it went broke you know. They ousted it, up here in this
area .
NT: So you heard about the union first from your mom. When
did they start distributing these kind of pamphlets? JS: About 1933.
Nt: How did they get them into the camps?
JS: Ah, well they were here. It isn't so terrible Nancy that
they were trying to wreck the country or anything. NT: Oh I know.
JS: Rather here see, when Roosevelt got in it was a legal to join the union, if you so choose!
NT: Yes.
JS: Yes.
NT: Yes. Did they distribute these fliers up there in the
camps? JS: Secretly.
NT: Oh they did?
JS: Yes.
NT: Did, did Mr. Fontachio come up himself?
20

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
JS: Ah, later on it was legal to organize it ---?--- you know.
NT: Yes.
JS: It tells pretty much of what they want to do here you
know.
NT: Yes. Well how did they, originally, did they just send
some kids in and did they just hand them out, or don't
you know how they got them in, in the first place?
JS: Yes, well they, you'd be down here and somebody would get a handful, and then you'd just kind of pass them out, to
the ones you could trust. NT: Yes, right.
JS: You had to be careful, at the time. They'd put on extra guards, at that time, but like I said, these people could see there was going to be a change. There had to be a change, and those two factions working here, what they call the National Mine Workers you know.
NT: Y es.
JS: And they were getting a stronghold, and they said that it
was communistic, or something, but I didn't know too much
about that. NT: Yes.
JS: I knew something finally got it started!
NT: Well up there in Mohrland, did you have organizers from
the National Miners Union as well as the UMW of A? 21

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
JS: Yes, they were turned around. They would hold mass meetings all over and then their meetings would be out of town. They couldn't handle them in town, you know.
NT: Where did they have them out at the end of the county, the mass meetings?
JS : In Mohrland?
NT : Y e s .
JS: Done by the ball park.
NT: Down in, in Hiawatha or Mohrland?
JS : Mohrland, and Hiawatha too.
NT: Y es.
JS: Then Mohrland and Hiawatha people get together and they
start, you know. ---?--- something we got to go with, it's important that we start organizing, and to me, it was one of the greatest thi ngs that ever happened !
NT: Yes. Well out there, ah did the UMW, or the National Miners Union have more of a following?
JS: Well at the start, the National Miners, they had a good hold down here, you know.
NT: Ye s .
JS: The people were so desperate, they was ready to join
anything to get some results, that was a, what it was all about. I think, Nancy, with that depression it was devastating .
NT: Yes .
22

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
JS: People were to the point where they just wanted a change, they were desperate.
NT: And then when the UMWA came in was that after the National Miners?
JS: It was about the same time, see. That's where the problem was ---?---
NT: Oh, I see. So would you say that the feeling in the camps down there at Wattis, and Hiawatha and Mohrland was pretty much the same as up this end of the country, or not?
JS: Well I think they was more for the United Mine Workers in that area, and over in here it as more that first union that came in. Like I said, the people were just desperate to belong to something, somebody to represent them.
NT: Oh yes, I'm sure.
JS: So they weren't looking too much to what was going to
happen. They just wanted some results!
NT: Yes, well nobody here knows in advance.
JS: That's right, yes.
NT: Maybe you can describe for me, what it was like for you
to go to a union meeting back in those days, leaving the town. Did you have trouble with the company, with the guards, with the superintendent, with the store?
JS: Well they weren't enthused about people attending these meetings .
23

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT: Yes.
JS: You know they were trying to keep them out as much as
they could. They weren't very happy with the union coming in because these people were older and they had the experience with union activities prior to that. They were trying to discourage the younger people from it, but this one supervisor, not the one that told me you'd be better off. He was a very sincere and honest man. He came out and said, "Whatever you want to do; either get on one side of the fence or the other, don't straddle it!"
NT: Yes.
JS: So they had let us know that he wasn't going to kill us
if we joined the union!
NT: Would he fire you?
JS: No, not at that time before this organization started,
that's why my dad was asked to leave.
NT: That's right. So did they have the meetings at night? JS: Well, I heard they had some of those night meetings, but
I never attended those meetings [sic] in the day time you
know.
NT: Yes . What, idle days?
JS: Yes, we wouldn't be working Nancy, so it would get around
that the meeting would be held. We would go down there. It had been out of town it was nobody's business then,
you know, [a] free country supposedly. 24

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT: Yes. Well did they have guards at the entrance? To the camp?
JS: At night, they had watchmen, and then the town marshall, ---?--- few days. But at night instead of one watchman they put on two so there was two, and they kind of check the cars that come in the town. They didn't want too many strangers in town. They wanted to know what their mission
was , you know.
NT: Yes, but then during the days when you went out to the
meetings, did you have any problem with the marshall? JS: No, he would ask who was there, who attended, "I don't
know, I wasn't there." He said, "I know different!" Nt: Yes.
JS: He knew different, because they had glasses on us!
NT: Yes, right. Did you have any guards down there with guns
or anything? JS: No.
END OF S I D E ONE
NT: You didn't have guards stopping you at the gate with guns
checking you and that kind of thing at Mohrland?
JS: Well not to my knowledge at that time. But they were suspicious of everybody that would come in town, they wanted to know what they were doing, where they were at
and all that kind of stuff. NT: Sure, sure.
25

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
JS: See, Nancy, we got some pictures here. There is the school house at Mohrland, eighth grade there.
NT: Oh you did!
JS: Yes. there is four rooms, but two to a room, first and
second, third and fourth, and fifth and sixth, and
seventh and eighth.
NT: Yes. Nice school though.
JS: Oh yes, and this is the coal camp, up to what they call
looking up from Centerville up to the Iceberg Canyon. NT: Where did you get all these photos made?
JS: Oh these are old ones, I got some, I had them re-made off
of original pictures. That is a first-aid and rescue team. They were in there. See their mine car. They use to bring it in [and] park in behind the store.
NT: You mean to say that the rescue team had their own railroad car?
JS: Government! This is Bureau of Mines.
NT: Oh.
JS: And this. Some of the people that were taking mine rescue
work, but we use to take first-aid, even the scout kids. NT: Oh you did?
JS: Oh yes! It was really interesting. It was a good thing in those days, and this is a couple of little engines pulling the coal up out of Mohrland.
NT: Where did t hey take the coal to? 26

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
JS: NT:
JS:
NT: JS :
NT: JS: NT: JS:
Over here to Martin, and then over to Provo.
What was their major contract though, to sell the coal to, do you know?
Well mostly it was commercial . Northwest and California , you know mostly, it was lump coal. It didn't go for slag. You mean in factories and stuff? Or was it home heating? Home heating mostly I guess, and I guess they used some for factories too Nancy. That is a doctor making his house calls. They tell me that's about 1914.
Who was the doctor out there?
That doctor was Dr. Rainey, they called him.
Yes, and who was the doctor that you remember out there? Oh I remember Dr. Roller, or Dr. Sorenson real well , and Dr. Lemon, and Dr. Hardy, he was over to Hiawatha, and then l eer on i t was Dr . Merrill, and Dr. Dodson bef ore Merrill. He was the doctor when my brother got killed, and Dr. Merrill was a very good doctor, camp doctor. They used to make house calls, Nancy! You ask a doctor about a house call today, it's an insult!
Yes, that's right!
Well that's a black fellow with his sanitation cart and buggy. They used to have t hese out houses t hat you see i n these little buildings here .
Yes.
They have a door in the back, Nancy and it just flipped

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
up you would raise it up and then they had this container there and he would dump it and then put his lime in there. The reason he took that job was he couldn't smell.
NT: Boy, he's the man for it isn't he.
RS: Y es.
NT: Was he there when you were a kid? In Mohrland?
RS: I guess he was there when I was a little kid, you know. NT: But you don't remember him.
RS: No, I don't remember him.
NT: Where did you get these? Who had the originals of these? RS: A fellow in Huntington.
NT: What is his name?
RS: Marshall.
NT: Marshall? Who Marshall?
RS: Let's see. His dad, I forget his dad's name, but Nel
Marshall is the son that had all these pictures and I just got a few and they had scads of them.
NT: That's amazing.
RS: So I had to take their original picture and have them
shot and then I got the negatives.
NT: Sure. Was the sanitation cart still coming around that
you remember, or not?
RS: No, I don't remember that Nancy, but--
NT: Did they have t he little houses, outhouses? RS: Oh yes. You bet, I dug a lot of toilet holes.
28

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT: Right.
RS: You bet. Here is mostly looks like that, Nancy. This
solitary house up here. They used to call it the Red House and behind it, see there, there's the tram line there behind it, and this is a little way shack and this is a road and right about in there you can see little horses and a team.
NT: Sure.
RS: That is going up to Centerville. This is what we call the
old tipple.
NT: This is where you worked?
RS: I started working there. Yes. I started working right
under here on the ---?--- tables. Cold was there. Look, you see that little iceberg. There is a broken pipe there , was leaking water, see?
NT: Ooh, yes.
RS: That thing used to go back and forth when it was shaking,
see, the shakes went back and forth like this. The trip coming on the top end here and then it came out on the bottom here.
NT: I see.
RS: And this is the grandstand, would believe? That's where
we used to hold our meetings. NT: Ooh, baseball . All right. RS: Yes, baseball.
29

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT: Did you ever play baseball?
RS: I played quite a bit.
NT: Well, how old were you when you were playing?
RS: Well, in Mohrland, let's see, in 1930s. Supported our-
selves. Had to pay 2 bits to get a ride in the car, for
gas.
NT: Did you have a good team?
RS: Oh yes. Between Mohrland and Hiawatha, we were rivals,
terrible. Boy, we would fight like heck. NT: Oh, you did.
RS: Oh you bet. And that's a hotel at Mohrland.
NT: Yes, who ran it?
RS: That last people I remember that ran it was Mr. and Mrs.
Bob Kelley.
NT: Yes . Who would come and stay at the hotel?
RS: Oh they, ball players. They imported ball players. Rocky
Evans who was the police chief in Salt Lake for years, he
would come out and play.
NT: So was he on the company?
RS: That was when they had those better teams and all.
NT: Yes, and they'd hire somebody just to play ball?
RS: Yes. But they had to work too, you know.
NT: Oh they did?
RS: They got a good job and they had to work. Red Hall, he
played ball and J i mmy Johnst one and J ack Duffey, and Lou 30

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
Gilbert Clicker that just died over in Huntington. He was a fine ball player. And there was the town marshall, Nancy. That's Mr. Oz Morgan. Osmond David Morgan, and he was working out in front of the store. On that end is the butcher shop and right about in here is the main store and right above there was in the same building was my office.
NT: What did the marshall have to do? What were his responsi- bilities?
RS: He was just taking care of everything.
NT: Was there a lot of problem with crime?
RE: Not really. You see all these little kids here and there,
always in trouble. And I was one of them. I used to get in a lot of trouble. And this is a couple of guys that, I never knew his name, but they called him Curly. A little Italian guy. And that's Frank Andy. And this building right here see it? That is in Mohrland. That is a baker shop.
NT: Oh I see.
RS: And this house right there is where we lived.
NT: Boy, that is nice to have a picture of it.
RS: And that is the shop crew in Mohrland. That is way back
there. Look at that young kid there.
NT: Yes. They sure did start young.
RS: See they have got those oil lamps. They just used to
31

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
generate their own power. See this was the boilers down there. And up in here is where we lived. See those little houses up in there. And that is what they called Tipple Town. That's where we lived.
NT: Were there different sections of town?
RS: NT:
RS:
Oh yes.
For Italians and Austrians and Japanese. What kind of people lived there? Were there any Japanese?
Yes , lovely people . They lived right up here. See, where this doctor is? There is a house way up there, and there was more houses and than they had some down below here see. And it's mostly Japanese people lived up there. And then some black people lived in what they called Centerv- ille. And then those Greek people lived in Centerville, kind of separated. And they had a coffee house up there and then you come down past the Red House. The next town was Tipple Town. That's where I lived and then they called another place there the Knob. That was mostly like American people. Then downtown, that was all American people.
So where were the Austrians and the Italians?
In Tipple Town mostly and Finns.
Finns. So you all were sort of mixed together?
Oh yes, the melting pot there, you bet, some nice people. Oh I guess. What about Hiawatha? Was it the same?
32
NT: RS: NT: RS: NT:

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
RS: Yes, they had it segregated like that, too. You know. NT: Did they have all the same races or groups there?
RS: Yes, they called them Greektown, Japtown, and Silk
Stocking row and Down Town. And String Town.
NT: Did they have any blacks there?
RS: Not in Hiawatha.
NT: Oh really?
RS: Not in Hiawatha. The first black I ever saw there in
Hiawatha was outside of playing ball. They had this defense program going and putting in these cookies and cans in the mines for this fall-out shelter and had the college kids there and there was a couple of black boys there. I was about to tell them this was the first black people that has ever been in this part of the mine. But there ' s some black kids up there now, I understand I think, one or two.
NT: Well times have changed, I'm sure.
RS: But some of those black people ther e, they wer e beautiful
people, Nancy. The bi g fellow ther e , who they called E. D. Pilate, was about 6-6 'n built just like Hercules, you know. Real generous, kind man.
NT: Must have been a good miner, too.
RS: He was. He would let his partners load the front car, you
know, and he would fall back to the third car. NT: Geez.
33

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
RS: [In dialect] You take this a day car, lad. You'd ask him, "How you doing' today, Mr. Pilate?" "Oh lad, all right, I seen better days." Oh golly, he was a nice beautiful
man. He's dead and gone, too, I understand.
NT: Well then, you talked about the baseball rivalry between
the two camps.
RS: Oh that was rough, Nancy. When they had these imported
players we called them. You know, the fans you know, they would just go crazy. They would be betting and fist fights and everything.
NT: What would happen to you if you lost, if you were on the losing teams?
RS: Well, we felt bad.
NT: Well naturally.
RS: It was terrible, but that happened.
NT: Somebody's got to lose. And if you won, did you get
treated or something?
RS: Oh no, not when I played ball, but I was mascot for these
guys in 1927, and 1926. They treated me good then.
NT: Like mascot, what did you do?
RS: Oh you took care of the bats and balls and gloves and
just in the way most of the time. That was your job, chasing balls. You'd have a partner that would chase the balls. One inning, you'd go shag balls, when they hit a foul ball, because when they went over that grandstand
34

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
they were out in the wilderness, so you had to go like heck to get that ball back. And then the next inning the other partner would go.
NT: So how many balls did they play with?
RS: Well usually the company bought the balls, I think they
would have a dozen on hand you know. And then when they would get scarred up and broke and that, they would give them to the kids and that is what we would use to play ball with. And of course we had a lot of friction tapes would come out of the mine somehow. And we would keep a lot of tape on that ball when we were youngsters.
NT: Who umpired these games?
RS: Well, they had a guy from our town, Mohrland, by the name
of Henry De freeze. He did most of it. Then Tom Kruger. He was the other umpire. And then Hiawatha, of course, they would have their umpire. These guys were workers in Mohrland and this Tom Kinney, he was a supervisor in Hiawatha. Then the store manager did some umpiring, Mr. Calpetti, he did quite a little bit of it.
NT: Did that make a difference as to who won the game whether it was the Mohrland umpire or the Hiawatha?
RS: A lot of times they thought so. Bad call you know. But in all sincerity I think they just judged on what they thought was right, you know.
NT: Yes.
35

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
RS: I don't think they deliberately tried to pull a fast one because it would be disastrous. You bet.
NT: How would you compare the power of the company in Hiawatha and Mohrland as far as running your lives or keeping you in debt to the store?
RS: Well, that as the deal, Nancy, when the union came in, they had this check-off system and if you wanted to buy out the store, you signed this check-off system. After the rent and union dues and all those expenses were taken, then the store had first shot at your pay. You never took the money over them and paid. They took it out and they could take everything up to $1. If you were in debt that much.
NT: Oh my goodness.
RS: And that was rough, Nancy. But before that they had what
they called scrip before the union come in. If you had money coming, you could go in there and get $5 worth of scrip and then if you wanted to go to town you'd have to take the scrip over to the store and they'd give you $4 for the $5.
NT: Y ou're kidding.
RS: Yes. that's the exchange. And I got to tell you this one
story.
NT: Okay, do.
RS: This was in 1933 when Roosevelt changed the postage, you 36

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
could get send a 1st class letter for 2 cents Nancy, would you believe, and he raised it to 3 cents. Okay, so that ' s a new law. There's a letter that comes in and it's important. A fellow I know got a letter from a girlfriend from Castle Dale and I go over there and this lady says, "There's 1 cent postage due." And I said, "Okay," so I reached in my pocket and I gave her a nickel, scrip nickel, and she pushed that out and she said, "Get that crap out of here, you're dealing with the United States government, fellow." She said, "We don't take that counterfeit chip here, what's the matter with you?" I said, "Well go get your husband, he's the one that issued it to me." And I didn't have a penny to get that. I had to go to the store and change that nickel. Get 4 pennies for the nickel.
NT: Oh my goodness .
RS: And that's a fact. That was 1933, Nancy.
NT: RS: NT: RE:
NT:
Was that right before the union came in, or right after? We l l , t h e u n i o n c a m e i n 1 9 3 3 .
It didn't really change the system.
It didn't change a heck of a lot, Nancy, you couldn't see much, you know. I t didn' t give you an open door and say, "Hey, we want this and that," you didn't do that then, just r ules.
What kind of difference did the union make when it first
37

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
RS :
came in?
Well, this National Recovery Act, the NRA, Nancy, they got that law in the 8 hour law, in 1898 and it was in 1933 when they cut it down, after you worked 8 hours, you would get time and a half. That was the government doing there . That ' s when we didn't have to work those 18 hour shifts and lay off 2 or 3 days and work another 18 hours. That eliminated that part. And, God, that was a blessing, you know. You acted like a human being again.
Y e s .
There wasn't any overtime. That's the way it was.
So it was actually a lot easier to work 8 hour shifts dai ly?
Oh gee yes and you knew what you were doing, you know, when you would go to work. If you started at 7 you figured you would be off by 3:30 and 4:00 at the latest, you know, depending on what your lunch hour. Now the lunch hour is paid for and you go right straight through.
NT : RS: NT:
RS:
NT: Well, like you say, times have changed.
RS: I'll say it's changed. And it's all for the better but
NT : RS:
sometimes I guess maybe they take advantage of it, too. They can overdo it, you know .
Y e s .
Now these fellows they ' ll double back or work overtime.
I've worked 45 years for that same company and I got one 38

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
meal because we was on the job and it had to be done and we worked so that they could work the next day and the superintendent he sent down to this boarding house and says, "Get some sandwiches and coffee for these fellows because they've got to stay." That was in the early 1930s. Now if you work 2 hours overtime, they send a lunch to you.
NT: Yes.
RS: I said, "I want one of those lunches." My partner, Johnny
Close, you know, he said, "You've got to work it." I said, "Well, I want a free lunch." I said, "I want to go on record that I got a free lunch from the company." And he said, "Well, you'll get it if you work overtime." I said, "Well, I've done a lot of overtime, if you double back, with nothing to eat."
NT: Yes.
RS: You know, Nancy, after you work 14 hours or so you start
getting shaky and you need something. NT: Oh yes.
RS: You bet.
NT: Didn't you bring your lunch pail into the mine?
RS: Well, if you worked, yes, you'd take and eat that as your
lunch, but then quitting time came and you're still working and then they would have dinner and you wouldn't have anything to eat, so.
39

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT: Yes, that is true.
RS: But the guys, if they were around there, they always saw
that you got something to eat, you know. But before the union came in, I used to run home for my lunch, over to Mohrland, and my mother says a hot lunch was good for you, so I had to abide by that, and I enjoyed it very much. Run home and it was just a short distance, oh, from here to Harmon's up there. I would run home and get my lunch and well, this day I didn't. They wouldn't let me go because they had to keep it going, and I started at 6:00 that morning and at 5 : 00 that afternoon, I went to him and I says, "I've got to have something to eat . " He says, "Didn't you get your lunch?" I said, "Not yet," and he says, "Well, if you can hold on a little longer we are kind of working short tonight." He said, "You can,--" you know. I said, "How short?" "About 8:00." I says, "I just can't do it." I went to my boss and said, "I just can't do it." He got kind of provoked at me. He said, "Okay, go." Got me in trouble going. That is the way it was. He had a job to take care of and you could see why he wanted, you know.
NT: Sure. Who were your bosses out there at Mohrland? RS: Oh, I had quite a few of them.
NT: Are any of them still around here?
RS: No, they're all dead and gone.
40

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT: They're all gone. So it seems like--I don't know if this is right or not, you had better tell me. Did guys start out as miners and then gradually raise up to be bosses or not?
RS: Oh yes. They do now yes.
NT: But did they then?
RS: Well, very few. Seemed like, Nancy, once they got that
one clan in there, or one group, until they died or something, there was no replacements. They didn't need them that bad. Used to be as superintendent and a mine foreman, assistant mine foreman and a pillar boss. That was it in the mine. The tipple boss and a night watchman and town marshall and a store. They were on salary and the rest was all--Now they have got salaried people all over the country.
NT: Yes. This group of people that was on salary, were they all related or where they friends or where they from the same area?
RS: No not necessarily so. They were no relation, most of them as I remember.
NT: Then how did you get into that group? RS: What do you mean?
NT: Say if you wanted to be a boss?
RS: Oh.
NT: How do you do it?
41

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
RS: Well, those days that I think it was impossible unless you had the education. Now, they got this school going' and the kids getting their fire boss's papers right away. Foreman papers and it's extra work, but, you know, if you got the education, you can do it today.
NT: So you just didn't have a chance for the education?
RS: No, I didn't have the chance. I had a chance once to become an assistant tipple foremen and I turned that
down. I thought I better stay where I'm at. NT: Yes.
RS: Because you would have to give up all your seniority and everything, you know.
NT: Oh ah.
RS: When you crossed over.
NT: What made the difference as far as kids being able to get
an education or older people to be a boss. Who got that
chance?
RS: Well, it was the ones that could afford it, mainly. And
like I say, high school education then was equivalent to a college degree today because those people that got a high school education were really something. And college, oh gosh, you know, there were several that achieved that goal. Some of the kids that I went to school with became teachers and something like that, but not doctors or anything like that.
42

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT: So was it mostly then like the superintendent's kids that could get an education?
RS: Yes. The superintendent's kids and the mine foreman's kid and there was a few others, the night watchman's kid. NT: Because when you were on salary you made enough, huh?
RS: It seemed like they were better off financially, yes, Nancy .
NT: No doubt.
RS: You bet. And they had big families, they had responsibil-
ities, too, but our homes and living conditions weren't
comparable to theirs by no means. No way.
NT: When you were a kid did you ever have a chance to have
fun, to play?
RS: Like what, Nancy?
NT: Well that's what I'm going to ask you. What did you do? RS: We just made our own fun, you know? In those days.
NT: What did you do? Did you go skiing or sledding, or play
games?
RS: Skiing, Nancy? Never seen a pair of skis. We used those
barrel staves. NT: Oh did you?
RS: Abut that long and you'd put a strap over about the center of it and those things squirt out like that and you do the splits and kill yourself. Never had a pair of ice skates and we used to borrow the superintendent's
43

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
son's ice skates and he was real generous with his stuff
and those are the kind you tightened on with the key. NT: Oh yes.
RS: Never had a sled. We made our own. These kids and they would have nice sleds and bikes and they were very generous. They would let us play with their stuff all the time.
NT: Oh that's nice.
RS: Yes. Football. They had boxing gloves and everything, but
they had them we didn't have them. Kids of the poorer class just didn't have that and that's all. I remember they would have these nice roller skates and coaster wagons and stuff and gee we'd have to rig up our own, make our own.
NT: But that didn't stop you from having fun, did it?
RS: Oh,no,wehadalotoffun,youbet.Usedtogooutand build these little camps, we called them camps, that, you
know, where nobody could find them and heck we'd smoke, play cards, eat. We would go downtown and get some baloney, some eggs and stuff and bread and gee we would have a good time.
NT: Was that during the summer when you were out of school. RS: Yes. [I] wasn't working and we would build these camps and close them up, you know, secret like and all, big secret deal and then he kids from downtown would want to
44

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
come up and interfere with us and we would have a gang
fight. They had those fights .
NT: Sure, that was just you boys together, weren't you? What
were your sisters doing? Did you let them in your camps. RS: Oh no, no girls allowed. We never had a swimming hole. We used to dam off the creek and swim in that, get those gunny sacks or cement sacks and fill them with dirt and
stretch them across the creek and full of rocks and glass and everything in there and the bath house was about 2 miles up above us. Doctor would come and give the order to the marshall to tear that out because it was contami- nated and we would say, "Ah come on! It purified. It was over 50 feet, and they would tear them out for us and then we would have to rebuild them and then they would come down here and get a suit and go to swimming. Boy, I'm telling' you that was extraordinary. That was some- thing out of this world.
NT: When was the first time that you came up here to the pool and went swimming?
RS: Up here, gee it was
NT: How old were you.
RS: Oh, I was about 12 or 13.
NT: Was that a special trip you made to town for that?
RS: Yes, with the scouts. We come down here one time with the
scoutmaster brought a bunch of us down and went swimming
45

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
and I think it cost a quarter, of course, that quarter got you a suit and permission to go swimming. It was hard for that quarter to come by but we made it. In the camps we didn ' t have any suits, it was in the raw.
NT: Well, why not.
RS: And I nearly drown a couple of times and a couple of
other kids nearly drowned and I helped them. Boy, I'm
telling you.
NT: Now everybody talks about the coal industry being boom
and bust, you know, good times and bad times. What were the good and the bad years for coal mining as you were growing up, as far as the economy was concerned?
RS: Well, Nancy, the best I can tell you after, it was tough for me all the way up until about 1941.
NT: Really?
RS: Yes. After the war, starting to think about war, that's
when it, I start[ed] doing pretty well. What happened, Nancy, instead of working 2 or 3 days a week, they went to 5 days. So, great, you know, there's another ten, fifteen extra dollars a week. And then wartime started working a little overtime then, 6 days and then more overtime. Your groceries were just staying right there. Nothing was going up, you know. But what was happening, there was more work available and I started putting away money then , very little . I was so thrilled, I took out a
46

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
war bond--$6.25 a month, not a half. Got about 4 of those bonds in a year which was, oh boy, I thought, gee, we're on our way up. But after that it started doing pretty good, and then the credit union come in years later, of course, this was in the 1950s then and started a little saving program, and was working pretty good and I worked every chance I got. I never turned a minute down and I'd fight like hell for my next overtime.
NT: When did things start to slow down again?
RS: Will, in the 1960s they started slowing down. It seemed like everything started going up and no work again, so
let's see in the 1960s, one year I made $4000 and then I didn't go below that. It wasn't very much, even at that time, Nancy.
NT: Yes.
RS: But I had already moved here in 1947, bought this place.
Of course, my wife, she was a nurse, and we worked and she worked hard and we had one child. So we've been pretty good.
NT: That's good.
RS: Then, of course, she passed away in 1972, Christmas.
END OF T APE
I never did make what you would call a lot of money. Then
I had this heart attack in 1973, the year after my wife passed on and about nine months later in September that

was the last day I worked. They totaled me out and said, "That's it." I wanted to go back to work but there was no way, you know, they advised me to take it. They says, "You've done enough, you've put in forty-five years and you got that little grand daughter coming up, what do you
want to keep a going for?" I says, "Till I crock." (Laughter) I felt I wanted to keep a going. But I've enjoyed my little granddaughter and daughter and then I remarried here three years ago, before this coming August. I've got a good lady, so, we're doing pretty
good.
Well, that's nice.
I tell everybody this is the best job I've ever had. (Laughter) But I would have liked to keep on working.
Normally, if you don't get sick when do they make you retire from the mines around here?
It ' s not compulsory Nancy.
You just keep going.
If you're able. A lot of them would have liked, a coal miner like I say, [sic] to get out of there about sixty- two because he figures his chances are getting slim you know and he's worked hard. But a lot of them, I know a fellow up there who is as old as I am and still working. Where is he?
Hiawatha. He's outside in the shop but he's good electri- 48

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
cian and a good mechanic and it's not that rough on him and he can keep going, he's in good shape. I'm sure, I would still be working if they would let me but I have to take a daily rest, a couple of hours every afternoon and one after breakfast and one after supper and gee.
NT: Ah, it's worth it though.
RS:
That's my little granddaughter up there and she's thirteen years old, that one dancing there.
Is she here in Price?
Yes, they live on 2nd East.
NT:
RS:
NT: What's your daughter's name?
RS: Delling, Alice Marie Delling. She teaches at the Durrant
School, fifth grade. Tiger or Crystal she goes to Notre Dame and on the far left Nancy's Tiger at eleven months old and in the middle is Alice at eleven months old and that's me when I was eleven months old.
NT: (Laughter)
RS: That's before my dad got killed, that was about four
months before my dad got killed. That was taken down here in Alaveto Store in what they called Frank's Studio. Those people, the parents to Herman Franks, manager for the Chicago Cubs.
NT: Oh really.
RS: Herman Franks you had probably heard of him being out of
Salt Lake, I knew his mother . 49

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT: Huh.
RS: And his dad is the one that took that picture.
NT: Goll, he's gone a long way hasn't he?
RS: Oh yes. Herman he's right off to your left and then I
knew his uncle and aunt. The first time I met Herman Franks, I didn't meet him, he come to Mohrland and here he comes and he's got a big black Buick and he drives up there and low and behold he goes in bowls and he's got his own bowling ball and shoes. (Laugher) Something we've never seen in our life. I was just thinking about that the other day. I said, "My gosh, just think how--" Now I got four bowling balls down here, Tiger she wants to bowl down here, the little girl. I've got a ladies bowl that I'm going to see if she can use it and if not she can have it redrilled, you know.
NT: Sure. When did Herman Frank show up at Mohrland?
RS: Oh, that was way back there in the 1930s.
NT: What was he doing out there?
RS: Well, he would come to see his uncle and aunt, they lived
there.
NT: What were their names?
RS: Malanchie, Dominique and Margaret Malanchie.
NT: Oh, I see, there are still Malanchies around.
RS: Yes, Brenda's relation, the Malanchies but Dominique he
passed on, he went over to Colorado here. You see, my dad
50

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
he bought some stock Nancy. Look at the date down there. NT: 1909.
RS: That was up in Scofield.
NT: Fish Creek Coal and Coke Company.
RS: How about that.
NT: Did this ever pay off?
RS: I don't know, I just found that. My mother had at least
some of that stuff and not too long ago.
NT: Does your mom still have a lot?
RS: Not too much.
NT: It ' s too bad because it might even be worth something. RS: Who knows .
NT: Yes, Fish Creek Coal and Coke Company, a $1.00 per share
paid in full to Gomer Thomas, General Manger, Scofield,
Utah in 1909. Boy. RS: How about that.
NT: Well, who knows. Well, I hope your mom hangs onto all these things.
RS: I got the written one here somewhere but it's something to hang onto.
NT: Oh sure. For all you know, you're dad could own part of a coal mine.
RS: How about that.
NT: That's nice. Well, do you got any other stories that I
haven't asked you about that you wanted to tell?
51

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
RS: Let's see Nancy. Really not too much. Oh, before the union come in you know, there wasn't too much work and this one boss he come and ask me and he said, "Do you want to work tomorrow?" I said, "Sure." He said, "You've got a shove; do you own a shovel? I said, "No." He said,
"Then, you can't work."
NT: Oh, you're kidding .
RS: Yes, I had to bring my own shovel to work. Oh, I got
really disturbed about that because I wanted to work but
then I didn't have a shovel.
NT: Did the company normally provide your shovel and your
picks or just the shovels . RS: Usually.
NT: Both of them.
RS: Oh, in the mine, no you bought your own shovel and pick
and when we resolved a contract, you bet, you bought your
own tools there, you bet. You paid for your own pick too. NT: Then how come you didn't have a shovel this time?
RS: This was on the outside and I needed a long handle shovel
to dig a trench or something.
NT: Oh, a different kind of shovel?
RS: Yes, like an irrigation shovel, you know, long handle and
brown nose and then a scoop shovel in there. But I didn't have one and so I couldn't get to work and I wasn't about to buy one because I couldn't afford it, gee whiz,
52

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
because a shovel like that costs about $1.25 but I didn't
have it so, I couldn't work.
NT: Where did you keep your tools, did you bring them home or
did you leave them in the mine?
RS: Oh yes, you left them in the mine.
NT: You had to.
RS: Yes, you would just hide them there, get them out of the
danger area and you would just leave them there.
NT: Did anybody ever take anybody else's tools?
RS: Not too much. But there was some of that tool pilfering
I understand and I was never aware of that but later on the joint orders come in and he was on contract and these guys would take their check off and put theirs on. So they would get credit for that car you know.
NT: But you didn't have that problem?
RS: No. But I guess there was some of that going on at times;
miners that did steal from each other. That you know, I guess that's been quite a long thing. What else. I have something else here that I was going to say. I think I got it pretty well covered.
NT: Well good, I've been trying to ask you everything I could think of.
RS: Well, I'm glad you did. It's quite interesting you know. NT: Oh, it is, it's much more for me I think because I
haven't heard it before.
53

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
RS: Well, then this boss and I'm sure it wasn't a company policy, it was just personal stuff you know. This other fellow was working and we towed this unit down and it had to be welded and we never had a welding outfit over to Mohrland or cutting torch or anything like that, every- thing was the hard way. So the super, he came over and picked up this unit and he took it over to get it fixed. It was just him and the boss there and the boss said,
"Now, you fellows go home and then when this gets through why you come back . " He said, "Of course you understand you're not getting paid." I said, "What time do you want us back?" He said, "I don't know when it gets back I'll come get you." I said, "You mean we got to stay home and wait for you to come and call us and we don't know what time it's going to come without getting paid." He said, "Doggonet we can't pay you that, you're going to be home." I said, "Yes, but were still in our grubbies and we can't go downtown or anything, what do you want us to do." He said, "Doggonet I should have got those other guys." I said, "Well, that would have been a good thing because I'm sure disgusted with you." And of course, that ' s a black market you see.
NT: Well then, what would happen to you. I mean just next time they wouldn't give you a job or something.
RS: See, personal stuff like that Nancy. 54

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT:
RS:
It sounds like though- -well, how would you r ate the bosses at Mohrland basically; were they basically good guys or basically there was a kind of a friction between miners and the bosses.
Oh yes, oh yes. Because that ' s a policy Nancy, they can't be too friendly with their employees. Back east, that's a no no. But out here gee, some of these bosses, we ' d rub shoulders together and went to parties together and stuff and we played ball together and just regular joes you know. But they don't encourage that in the least, out here i t wasn't that bad but it's getting pretty much this way now, you know, they don't want to associate with-- It's worse now you think then it was when you were young?
NT:
RS: I think now they're separating more, you know, there's
not that companionship because they can't get too
friendly I guess.
NT: Well, why could they get friendlier in the earlier days. RS: Well, I'm talking now about the 1940s Nancy, playing ball
and partying on and this kind of stuff. You see the employees got up where they could afford to get out a little bit and enjoy some of the things and pay their own way .
NT: What about in the 1920s and 1930s, how did the bosses and the miners get along?
RS: Well, you know what Nancy, it's just the thing in those 55

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
NT: RS: NT: RS: NT:
RS:
NT:
days that when I first started working that the super and the bosses and the principal and the school teachers was next to God. That's the discipline we was under from home. That's what was taught the day with respectable people and that was it, they was our, we were suppose to buy everything they said and that was it. My mother, she was 90% or a 100% sure for the school teachers and the town Marshall he come up and tell her something and boy she believed everything he said.
(Laughter) Was it true? Some of it.
(Laughter)
But I was in trouble all the time it seemed like.
I know, well then even though it sounds like that you got along well with like the superintendent's kids.
Oh yes, got along good with the kids and that, you bet. There is real nice people.
But at what age then do you get before there's kind of a split?
RS: Well, when you start working then Nancy, then the boss can't be too nice to you because then it causes, it's just not the policy, that's all. They don't kick you around our beat you up or anything like that, but they want you to know who's who.
NT: It's just the system I guess, wasn't it? 56

 MR. REMO SPIGARELLI May 5, 1982
RS: It's the system.
NT: Well, I want to thank you for spending your time with me
today.
RS: Sure Nancy, I hope I've said something that might be, you
know, that you can use or something. NT: Oh, I'm sure.
