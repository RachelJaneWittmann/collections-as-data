 THIS INTERVIEW. WITH J . WALLACE CORBIN, PRESIDENT OF MIDLAND TELE- PHONE COMPANY, TOOK PLACE IN HIS OFFICE IN MOAB UTAH ON JULY 23, 1970. THIS INTERVIEW IS A PART OF THE URANIUM ORALD HISTORY PROJECT CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH AND CALIFORNIA STATE COLLEGE AT FULLERTON. THE INTERVIEWER IS STEVE GUTTMAN.
SG: Mr. Corbin, when did you first start working for Midland Telephone Company?
JC: In May of 19.46, after I got out of high school. I had worked the summers before for a couple of years, just as an extra hand on
the line crews and various things. I started permanently in 1946 as a lineman or an installer repairman. Later I moved onto line foreman for a few years. Then I was plant superintendent for a few years. After that I went on to district manager. And about that time I was put on the Board of Directors. Let's see, in 1951 I was elected to the board. Back in 1957, I was elected vice- president and district manager. In 1961, I was vice-president
and district manager. In 1961, I was vice-president and assistant general manager, in '64 vice-president and general manager, and
in '68 president and general manager. This is a total of twenty- four years now.
SG: Approximately what size was the company in '46 when you started? JC: In 1946, there were approximately 700 stations. I'll give you the
line total we worked up here. By '51 it was 824 total stations. This included extensions and everything. In '52 it was 1,007;

 J. WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 2
in '53 it was 1,236; in '54 it was 1,533; and in '55 it was 1,781. Let's see from there until '60 we don't have a figure. But in 1960, we had 2,325 stations, and just right on up. In
'61 we had 3,500; in '62 there were 3,932; in '63 we had 4,007; in '64 we had 4,211; in '65 it was 4,276. It started slowing down right in that area for a time. In '66 we had 4,502; and
in '67 we had 4,924 stations.
SG: So it's been steady all along?
JC: It's just b.een a steady growth. Right now we have 5,381 stations
as of the end of June, 1970. So it's been a tremendous growth
over that period of time.
SG: Was all this growth due to increased customers, or did your terr-
itory itself increase?
JC: The territory increased in 1947. We took on an exchange at Dove
Creek, Colorado. But it didn't add a á:hiág ádeal to it. Total stations out there now are only about 400 in that particular
town. So that wasn't the big thing. It was primarily the activity
with the uranium industry that started it all, which included the years of about '52 clear up till now, really. Plus, the potash, the tourism, and the various and Sunday things that have also b.rought it on. Uranium was a very big factor for all the growth liefore. It still is for that matter. The potash, of course, ,

 J. WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 3
brought on a great deal, also, in the last four years, but nothing
has had quite the impact as the uranium did.
SG: You had no way of telling that the uranium boom was coming on? JC: No. You know, we'd heard this for years and years and years, big
uranium finds and that type of thing. Nobody really believed it. It never amounted to a great deal of anything other than what we had heard for years in the uranium activity. It was just a very small thing, little mines working here and there, until Stein actually found the first big bonanza to get it started. People kind of questioned what he was talking about, bragging that he had all sorts ofá:e-li.i.n~s and people just more or less ignored him, including us. We didn't really think he had any big thing. So it really just crept up on us. All of a sudden it was here. There wasn't a great deal you could do about it. After the first
big run on us hit, it was more or less of a nightmare for a utility company. We had little small communities here that had ample telephone circuits. We had a brand new dial system that they put in here in Moab in 1948, and with the regular growth that we had, that would have lasted forever, practically. Within ahout four years it was completely obsolete. We had added to it
as far as we could go. We had to put in a whole new complete office that had an unlimited growth to it, unlimited even to a

  J. WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 4
point where we though it was unlimited. I could go up to a thousand-line office. We've already outgrown this now, and have gone to a twelve-hundred line office. Now we're building a new building here, as a matter of fact, because we've outgrown the office that was supposed to handle the ultimate unlimited growth forever, you know. So now we're going into a new type of system that we'll cut into service next year that allows unlimited growth. The building is not limited for growth. We bought a piece of property here so we can expand forever. We've already got it projected for the building itself so that the building's capacity
hold the equipment which will take us up to 1985 before we have to add onto the building. But it's a knock-out type building.
We can build it a hundred and sixty feet long and a hundred feet wide if we have to. So now we think we've gotten to that point, but maybe twenty years from now we'll run out of room again.
SG: As best you can see now, you're at a point where you can meet any future needs?
JC: We can meet anything in the future that might come up now. During that time, you didn't know whether it was going to last just a day, or a month, or a years from then. We were cautious about what
wasá put in b.ecause the equipment is very costly and it takes a great deal of time to get it. That's what hurt us so badly during

 J .
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 5
the boom. Like I said, we had a little small office here. We had plenty of cable planned to last the company the way it was going. We had enough toll citcuits out of here connected to the Bell System. It was more than enough to take care of our needs. And all of a sudden, we had dumped on us about five or ten times the business that we normally had on a toll basis. We had three circuits to Grand Junction, two to Price, and a couple going out the other way into Colorado; this was ample. Now we have nine circuits going to Grand Junction. With the new ones coming in,
I think there are going to be forty-six to Salt Lake City. There's three direct to Provo, and six Price circuits. We've gone beyond the wireline-type carrier. We've gone into microwave so that we've got an unlimited amount of growth in our toll circuits. We can
go up to six hundred circuits on the one microwave system. During that period from about '53--well, particularly the latter part of '53 and all of '54 and '55, it was just a nightmare to try to get a toll call out of here. You were real lucky if you made it in
short of about six or seven hours. There was quite a waiting list. Western Union Telegraph was our only salvation. They used to send out something like two hundred telegrams a day in place of making
a long distance call. We were kidded, and are still kidded today, that during that period of time, if you wanted to call Salt Lake

 J .
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 6
City, you could drive up there and back quicker than you could
call there. Well, we still take a lot of ribbing over that. It was a very interesting experience. I wouldn't really care to
go through it again, but after it was all said and done, and most of the prohlems were solved, you look back on it, and it was really a rewarding experience to take a company that in 1949 was valued
at around $200,000 for the total cost of the telephone company,
and today it's about $3.6 million. To replace it at today's prices, it would be closer to $6 million or $7 million. This is the de- preciated value at about $3.6 million right now. We're on quite
an expansion program now to get on with the things that we need to do such as this new expansion of the building. The microwave
system just expanded into Lake Powell down here at Bullfrog--
The microwave system down there, a dial exchange, the whole thing. So we've come a long way. But during the uranium boom, we took
a great deal of criticism because people were of the opinion that you could get circuitry overnight. There was something like a year's delay on most equipment. So b.y the time you found out
what happened to you, all of a sudden you were hit with this prob- lem. You didn't know how big it was. You were trying to be cautious and yet try to take care of the demands. By the time your engineer
had it ordered and installed in here and ready to go, why, you

 J .
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 7
were talking about a year. So maybe you were a little bit too cautious; you didn't do quite enough. You didn't get as many circuits as you really should have. So for a two-year period,
it was a real nightmare. Oh, about the best you could get, as far as local service, other than the few people that had private lines at the time the boom hit us, there was no such thing as another new private line until about after 1955. But during
'54 and '55, why, it wasn't unconnnon to have four-party business lines just right within town here, block or two from the office, or a mile or two. Just wasn't anything to be had any better.
So that's kind of the way it went.
SG: In the outlying areas, how many were on party lines? What was common then?
JC: You mean outside of the valley here?
SG: Yes, if you lived outs.ide the valley.
JC: There were eight and ten-party lines, a lot of them, most of
them. There are still a few eight and ten-party lines. We've got probably, oh, maybe twelve of those left that are still up around eight parties. There is one that still has ten people, but that runs all the way over the mountains. That's a line about twnety-three miles long, and it's the only thing in there. It goes all the way into the Castle Valley area and up the river

 J .
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 8
and over the top of the mountain. So it does have ten on it, but it's not the common thing now. We're working toward all one-party service within the approximate city limits, and then graduated on out to twoáand four-party service. We want to get all our rural lines cut down to four, approximately.
SG: You said four was the average in the city for a time. When did this finally end?
JC: Before we got some real relief, it was about 1956, and even parts of 1957. We're still looking for relief. Even today, we're still growing. Every year we've gained an average of 300 to 375 tele- phones. This year has been a slower year than any so far. We've made less gain. We were well ahead of the gain until about the time school let out when a lot of people transferred from Texas Gulf. When school lets out several families leave. But this year it hit us a little bit harder than ever before. We do have a
41 gain, company-wide. This isn't just Moab, this is company- w.ide for the first six months. We're projecting about 120 gain for this year, which would be the lowest year we've had in quite some time.
SG: Is Texas Gulf the reason for it?
JC: Primarily, Texas Gulf is the reason for that. A lot of people
left on a transfer. So we did lose quite a few stations there.

 J. WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 9
Now that that's stabilized, and they have finally made their announcements, I think that will help solve a lot of that prob- lem. A great many people were just plain running scared.
SG: If a person wanted a single line now in Moab, is there any problem in getting it?
JC: Not too much. Right at the very moment, yes. We've just made a hundred-line addition this spring, and they just went like hotcakes. We have another hundred-line addition coming in this fall. So
right at the moment now, there is a waiting list. We have a few lines left, but it depends on where they are. We are more or less reserving these private lines for business only instead of upgrades. Now this fall, again, we'll go on the upgrade program. Next year there will be a two-hundred line addition to the central office
here and our huge cable expansion, so that by the end of next year, almost anyone within the city limits can have a private line if they so desire. In fact, we're going to start selling, pushing for
private lines. Our outside plant right now and this new building addition here are what's holding us up. There's about a $300,000 expansion this year on the outside plant. It's for cable facilities. The building itself is being built. The equipment will be in, but not installed, until about March of next year for this new two-
hundred line addition. So then we'll be in real fine shape. We

 J. WALLACE 'CORBIN PAGE 10
have a waiting list right now of probably sixty upgrades that would like private line service. But we can't take care of them until this fall and next spring. It's feast or famine, and a lot of
it's the people's faultoon this particular one. We are on a $3.5
million expansion program over a six-:year period right now. As
a part of this, we s.ent out questionnaires to every subscriber we had, asking them to just check what they'd like in the way of s.ervice. "Do you want a private line, or are you satisfied with what you have? Would you like something else?" and so forth. We sent out about 3,600 of these questionnaires to every main station
w:e had, and we got about 180 of them back. About 80 of them, as I recall, had what they wanted already, and the were courteous enough to answer. They didn't care to have anything else. They
had a private line and they were satisfied. About 100 of them
wanted something else. They wanted a private line or a two-party.
So w:e took these and took care of them. But we ordered on the
basis of that questionnaire, that hundred-line addition. We got
it in, and we took care of all the ones that had asked for service.
Then everybody else found out that you could get private line now.
"Well, why didn't I get one?" "Well, did you answer the questionnaire?" "No, I didn't ever see any questionnaire." "Well, I didn't think
ahout it." Primarily it's their fault hecause we were prepared to

 J . WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 1 1
order whatever was necessary. You don't give hundred-line add- itions away. That particular hundred-line addition cost us $90,000. And I wasn't ahout to order two hundred and have a hundred of them sitting there. So that's the way we ordered it.
SG: I guess because of the expense in this, you can't overexpand. JC: You just can't over expand because the money is just too darned hard to get. Our expansion program is running roughly $750,000
a year. It should be running higher. We should be running more, but with the cost of money and the difficulty in getting finance, we are holding it to about $750,000. We will complete this year about $80.0,000. Next year we've already budgeted at $746,000 in our expansion. And each year, until we get done what we want to do, it'll run about that.
SG: Have you floated any bonds or anything?
JC: Yes, we floated bonds all the way through it. We have them with
two different bonding companies now: one with Pacific Mutual, and one with American National Life Insurance Company. We are right now just on interim financing through the mother company. They're trying to locate permenent financing bonds to give us this year's expansion money that we've already spent, and are spending, and next year's.
SG: Do you remember when you floated the first bond?

 J .
JC: SG: JC: SG: JC:
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 12
Oh, 1et me think. It was about '55, I think.
Is that when you became convinced that the boom was for real?
Yeah. It was roughly '55 when we got our first amount of money.
Was that before you were trying to make it on bonds?
We were meeting it on just small conventional loans. We had bonds; actually, we had Midland Bonds. We sold those. But this was small stuff. It took care of our needs each year as we were growing. But after the boom hit, there wasn't any way in the world that we could keep up with it. When we put in our first large toll system that
we connected with the Bell System at Provo, we had to float our
firs.t real big bond issue then. It was an enormous amount of money to us. It was $400,000 and the interest rate was 4.75 per.cent--
4.5 percent onthe first one, I guess it was. Boy, we though that
was something. Now we're paying 9, 9.5 percent. I suppose next year we'll probably pay 10. So now we have a debt of something over $1.5 million. Been paying it back all the time. In fact, the old original indebtedness is just almost paid off. But it's come a long, long way since I first started for it. My grand- father started this company around 1900, brought it in as just one line across the desert through Mack, Colorado; it's just out
of Grand Junction about thirty miles. He bought a ground circuit into this Cas.tle Valley area up here to begin with, and then over

 J .
WALLACE CORE.IN PAGE 13
the top of the mountain into the valley. Originally it was the
La Sal Mountain Telephone Company. He built that. Then he later sold it to some ranchers up in the valley. I think they held onto to it about two years and gave it back to him. They didn't like it. They didn't want any part of it. They just gave it to him. He come back in--that's in about 1903 when he really got going
and he started putting in some telephone service. It's been in the family for many years.
SG: What are the main reasons for tying into a continental system after all these years?
JC: Well, primarily for their availability to money and services. It was getting more and more difficult for the £amily to maintain
our equity in it. Every year, when we had to bond new money, we had to have a different stock split to satisfy the bonding comp- anies with the amount of stockholders that we had, so we were having to branch out and sell stock. We weren't trying to be greedy or anything, but we didn't want to hang onto as much of it as we possib.ly could. So it was getting to a point where it was just plain getting too big for us to handle and maintain the amount of equity that the five principal stockholders had in it. They
were: my brother, my father, one of the local people here, Dan O'Lary, my two sisters, and myself. Among the five or six of us, we controlled about 80, 85 percent of the stock. We had sixty-

 J .
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 14
five stockholders when we sold, but we did hold about 85 percent
of the stock among six people. But it was getting to a point where it was just plain getting too big for us to keep up with. Now
we look hack on it. W~ sold it originally in 1961 as a stock trade, and we look back on it now and wish he had held it for another two or three years. because from about '61 to '64, in that area, we didn't have to have a lot of new financing, and we could have got a great deal more money out of it if we had held onto it for ab.out four more years--three, at least. But we thought the time was right, and it sounded like a real good deal.
SG: In terms of the family itself it would have been better if it wasn't offered this money?
JC: Yeah, we could have held on to more equity in the company in a sense. We can't say that we got hurt. It's kind of like having your cake and eating it, too. We sold it, and I managed it for the people that bought it. I have pretty much a free hand. They
have their policies, which we may or may not have had, but it's w.orked out very well, really. The holding company people are real nice to work with. We don't always see eye to eye, but I don't think anybody does as far as that's concerned.
SG: To go hack to the time of the boom, did the fact that so many people were living in Moab and that the mines were so randomly scattered through the two counties , add problems to it?

 J. WALLACE CORE.IN PAGE 15
JC: Well, not too much because most of the people that were working
at the mines were living in, say, Monticello or in the Moab area.
We had very little requirement for service other than the mines themselves. They all had private line circuits into Moab. There were a few people living around the mines, but basically they lived in the town. Most of them at the time had to live in trailer houses b.ecause there was not enough homes to go around anyway. So this caused a lot of problems. They were under every shade tree in the valley. They weren't congregated until, oh gosh, maybe '57. They started in with some trailer parks that wouldn't accommodate more than two or three. Most of the time before, it was somebody's backyard or off under a shade tree, or something of this nature.
I think it was about 1959 or '60 right along in there, when they built this big huge one down here, which really didn't go over quite as well as they thought it would. But they did the trailers in one spot. Then w.e had another one down here, then two or three of them, until it got to where they were finally being put together in one place where you could take care of them. They weren't scattered so bad.
SG: In other words, if there had been housing to begin with, a certain amount of your problems would have been a lot easier to handle?
JC: It would have been a little different because when you would have had a subdivision type thing, you'd run in a piece of cable, and

 J .
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 16
you're taking care of maybe fifty homes. With trailers scattered all over, there wasn't anything in one concentrated area. It was just like trying to catch up with a bunch of ants all over the devil. So this did hinder us a great deal because the expense of getting to them would b.e greater than it would have been if they actually had been congregated in one area.
SG: So you laid a lot more cables. Do you have any idea--any estimate at all of how much cable was laid during this period?
JC: It was thousands and thousands of feet. The thing of it was, again we were being cautious. Like I said earlier, you didn't know from day to day where you were. So you'd go out here and you'd put up a hundred-pair cab.le. Six months later it was com- pletely full. You should have put up a two-hundred-pair cab.le. But it costs twice as much money to put up a two-hundred, and if
you're not going to use it, then a hundred was plenty at the time, see. So then you come along six months later and you put up another hundred-pair cab.le. Well, two one-hundred-pairs cost you more than one two-hundred pair by quite a lot, so this hindered us a great deal too. We were very cautious with what we were doing. We had
to throw. the plant in. That's why we're reb.uilding so much now,
we had to throw it together. We got cables hanging on poles out here; we got five or six hundred pair of cables, and there

 J .
W ALLACE CORBIN P AGE 1 7
shouldn't be more than two or three of them. So we're rebuilding, going underground with a lot of our cabeling, getting off the
main drags. We'll have almost everything off the main streets.
But if you look out across that street out there, you can see the mess.. We've got just cahle after cable after cable. Where you should have gone in with a thousand-pair, we got a thousand sitting there in ten different cables. But you just didn't know from one month to the next how long something was going to last.
SG: Looking back upon it now, do you think maybe you were too cautious? JC: Well, had we known what was going to happen, yes. If we could
have looked into the future, yes, we were too cautious. But at
the time there wasn't any way in the world of doing it any different than we really did.
SG: There had been too many mini-booms before?
JC: You1d had too many booms, you know, áthat fell flat on their face
over the years. It was kind of like feast or a famine. All of a sudden they were here, and then all of a sudden they were all gone. About 1957, everything started really dying down and they
were settling back into just the good mines, the ones that were producing. We thought, '~an, this is going to fall flat on its face for sure yet." But it didn't. One thing led into another, and we've had more than our share of the booms around here with

 J . WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 18
uranium, potash. Now tourism is more or less a boom, and the oil and gas activity. We've heen a very fortunate little connnunity here for what's happened over the last twenty years.
SG: Has tourism caused any special prob.lems for you?
JC: Not really. It's really quite difficult to measure your tourist
traffic, what they do for the telephone company. We know that they help us a great deal. It's very difficult to say how much. Of course, they don't use any local service to speak of. But they help in many ways. We know during the summer months, during the tourist months, our toll traffic always increases. It's not
all tourist because a lot of your exploration is done during that same period of time. Weá do have quite a rise in our toll volume starting ab.out the first of March running through November. We know a lot of it is tourist business but it's very difficult to
measure exactly how much. But it really hasn't caused us any prohlem keeping up with the tourist part of it. We have to schedule our operators heavier and this type of thing during that period of time, hut that isn't any problem.
SG: Does the isolation of some of these mines and the road conditions also enter into laying these cables down to get into the uranium
mines?
JC: Yes. We didn't bury cab.les into the mines. We built open-wire
circuits into them and then put carrier circuits on the open-wire.

 J. WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 19
It was a pretty tough undertaking on some of them. A lot of them were served, and still are served, by mobile radio, where they are
just too far away from any possibility of building a toll line to them or a telephone circuit of any kind. The mines out around the B.ig Indian area, most of the major mines do have telephone service into them. It wasn't really too far from the existing service we had going into the town of La Sal. I think the longest one was prob.ab.ly fifteen miles. Primarily, it was the ones other than those right in that general area. There's a few out around Dove Creek that we serve. The ones that are way out we've served all these years with fixed rural radio, mobile radio, and it's worked out quite nicely for them because it was completely out of the question to run a toll line such as, oh, the mines that are down in White Canyon, Red Canyon, some in that area. You couldn't
have touched them. They were a hundred miles from any type of s.ervice at all. So they've worked out fairly well with this mobile radio service. It's quite a godsend to them, in fact. They wouldn't have had anything if it hadn't been for that.
SG: You were constantly laying down this stuff, building new lines, and keeping up your existing lines. Did you have problems with
maintenance too? I know from talking to the guy from the electric company that they had all kinds of problems keeping up their equipment?

 J. WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 20
JC: Well, they've got a little different type of prob.lem than we have b.ecause we just run another cabJ.e right alongside, inside of the same ring as the cables that are already there. So it's not the major problem to us that it would b~ to them. If their juice is not high enough in an area, and they've got to shut it down and put in a heavier wire, heavier transformers, it would be a major prohlem to them, whereas it wouldn't b.e to us. We can just put
it right along-side the existing facilities that were in there, just add to it, add another cable, or whatever. So this wasn't a big problem as far as that is concerned. We could keep the other stuff working while we were putting in new.
SG: I guess you're lucky.
JC: Yeah, we were lucky that was. The power company did have a lot
tougher time than we did in that respect. It wasn't just a
matter of putting another pair of wires along-side it. They just about had to overbuild with a new section and take the other stuff out, or relocate, or whatever, and they did a lot of that.
SG: How much larger has your work force become.
JC: I was just trying to think of what we had in about 1949 or '50.
We had somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty-five to forty-five people. We have seventy-two people now. We've maintained between sixty-áeight and seventy-two for about the last, oh, ten years. We're

 J .
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 21
hiring more all the time, primarily in operators and the outside plant force. The clerical help is basically, well, we've hired
a few there, hut we've gone through so much automation through this new holding company that it's helped out in a lot of ways. The billing is all done by computers; the checks are all made out be the computers; they pay our bills. So it's held our work force in that particular area down. But the operator force has climbed considerab.ly, toll operators. In fact, we're short
right now. In the past six months, we've had about twelve or thir- teen of our top operators leave us for one reason or another. About s.ix of them transferred out with Texas Gulf, a couple of them re- tired, and some of the girls are bound to get pregnant, and they can't work any longer.
SC: What kind of problem is there in keeping workers in this area? JC: It's pretty darned tough. It's just not a real ready available market for telephone operators. You just very seldom ever find
one that is an experienced operator. You train them yourself.
And you get so many peopl-e that, well, just one of those I was talking about, there was three of them that I can recall that when they came in here to go to work, they planned to be here forever, you know. They~d be here from now on. Three months later some- thing happens. They decide to leave the country, and away they

 J .
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 22
go. Or they get married or something else. And it's real tough. Well, right now we're really concentrating on people, and we're not particular about their age. There is a point of no return on
the age, really, unless they've had some experience before. In other words, nine times out of ten a sixty-two year old woman starting on brand new does not make a telephone operator. It
just doesn't w.ork unless they've had some experience before. The age thing used to be quite an issue in the telephone business. If you w.ere heyond about twnety-nine or thirty, you were dead in the telephone business if you hadn't already started. But they found that all over the industry, and of course your federal laws have changed that too. You just can't work it that way. So now I
don't care if they're fifty years of sixty. If they're good po- tential people who are going to be here, I'll hire them, particularly for switchboard operators. We're really concentrating on people
that have been here for years and are going to be here. You take
an operator, and one of them you can train, and in two weeks they're an excellent operator. The next one will take you three months,
and mayb.e another one will take you six, and they never will b.e
a good one. So it's a very, very costly thing to train your girls, and then not have them stay w.ith you.

 J . WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 23
SG: Are wages in your system the same as in the Bell system?
JC: Yes, we use the Bell System's wage scale. It's a zoned scale. In other words, our pay scale is identical to the pay scale of
any Zone Four company in the Bell System. Price, Utah is a Zone Four office. We don't operate a union. We have no union here, and hopefully we won't get one. We feel we can operate better without it. We haven't any reason to get a union because we operate on the union contract of the Bell System. We give them everything that the Bell System agreement gives them, plus we
give them just a little bit more so they won't have any real need for a union. If the Bell System changes, we automatically change. If their union agreement changes in any way, we adopt it auto- matically just so that we won't have any reason to have a union. Because they can't gain anything but a payroll deduction, really. Actually they'll lose because we give them many things the Bell System does not give them now with the insurance or the hospital- ization. We give it to them. It doesn't cost them anything. We
pay it for them. Just various things like this. The Bell System employees have to pay a certain portion. So we do try to maintain something just better than what they could get because we don't need a union here?
SG: I assume that you had problems recruiting workers during the boom.

 J. WALLACE CORE.IN PAGE 24
JC: You bet. We certainly did. We had a tremendous time. We hauled in people. At one time w.e owned seven trailer houses, and we rented about six or seven apartments. We built this building out
here with two apartments on top of it so we'd have a place to put out people after we brought them here. This didn't work too well either. We'd just go out and recruit them and bring them in and give them a place to live to work for us. After they got in, they didn't like the town. They just didn't last long. So that didn't
work too well. But it was the only way. We couldn't find housing,
w.e couldn't find people.
SG: Where were you recruiting from?
JC: Anywhere we could get them, just anywhere. We were advertising
in some of the telephone magazines for operators. We got a lineman out of Texas with a history of telephone experience a mile and a half long, and when he got here, I don't think he'd every seen
the other end of a shovel or a pair of climbers or anything. We got two out of Texas that weren't worth enough powder and lead
them to b.low them to kingdom come! We were just having a devil
of a time this way trying to find people.
SG: If there weren't any workmen here, you'd send to maybe some of
the other companies to temporarily ask for help?
JC: No. The only kind of agreement we had was with Bell System.

 J .
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 25
They did a great deal of our work for us. We would hire them to come in and do cab.le splicing and installations of various types of equipment that we weren't equipped to handle. And, of course,
your manufacturers, most all of them have installation crew so everything of this nature we were having done. We were trying
to maintain and put up our own cables and this type of thing, install our own phones, but anything beyond that, we were just hiring from the manufacturer that we bought from to have it put
in after we bought it.
SG: That cost, too, I assume.
JC: Uh huh. Of course, this is the going thing now. We maintain
a small line crew. We've got a three-man line crew, and some- times there's four. We're doing the small things, our small
jobs. But we hire all of our cable to be put in by companies
that specialize in this; we hire them to do it. We'll hire them again this fall when we start this $300,000 expansion; we'll
hire it all done. We do just short jobs, such as line extensions and things that come up when there isn't enough to get a contract- or in to do all at one big fell swoop. We had them in here last year. Gosh, they were here ab.out six months doing cable work for us in all the exchanged, Dove Creek, Monticello, and Blanding,

 J. WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 26
here, all over. We'll get them back again this fall. They'll be here probably another six months again this year. We can't main- tain that big of a crew. They can bring in a fifteen-man crew and eat something alive, whereas we couldn't maintain a fifteen- man crew because we don't need them all the time. It's just cheaper in the long run to hire that type of work done, and then you do your small stuff. That's worked out quite well. They're
well equipped. They'll move in on a job and get it done and get the devil out.
SG: Do you have any idea how much money was spend in this short period of years on your expansion?
JC: Well, as I said,:. the company in 1949, 1950 was valued about $200,000. Today, it's valued at $3.6 million, almost $3.7 million. Depreciation is in there each year for about $150,000. So over
a period of twenty years, you're talking over $400,000 in deprecia- tion. Actually there was $4 million spent, and you had the $200,000 to start with, so it's been about $3.8 million spent in that twenty years. Like I say, we're just getting a real good start on the expansion program that we started a year and a half
ago. It's a $3.5 million to $4 million expansion program. We've got hehind us, about, oh, roughly $1.5 million of it in two years, and we'll get another within the next year. And with what we'll

 J . WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 27
finish for the balance of this year's and next year's construction, we'll put another million behind us. We'll add another $3.5 million to it. About the time we started this expansion, we'll
be roughly a $6 million dollar company.
SG: So you're figuring on this area to continue on its present growth rate?
JC: Very definitely. We're very optimistic about it. People every day cry poverty here. I can't agree with them. Our business
is going stronger now that it ever has. The toll volume is higher than it's ever heen. We're completing two or three hun- dred calls more a day this year than we were a year ago. Oh,
we're not going to make the station gain this year that we have done over the past years, but as far as gross money, we'll gross about a million dollars in 1970. We're now preparing the 1971 budget. That's what that mess is on that table over there. And I'm projecting a gross revenue of--I hadn't quite completed it,
but it was about $1,150,000 for 1971. I have a great deal of faith:á.in our country., I think it's going to continue to grow. I don't think it's going to be as phenomenal as it's been over the past twenty years. I don't think it's going to be that
drastic, but we have 5,381 telephones as of right now. We had a forecast made by some professional people that by 1985 we're

 J . WALLACE CORE.IN PAGE 28
supposed to have approximately 10,000 stations. Whether or not they're accurate--they put a great deal of planning into it, fore- casting the grow.th. So in the next fifteen years, we're going to just about douhle, according to their figures.
SG: In the state of Utah, is there much state regulation of what you can do and can't do with the prices?
JC: You'd better believe it! Everything you charge has a tariff on
it, and you can't charge anything more than is approved by the tariffs. There are all regulated by the Public Service Commission of Utah.
SG: Are thes.e flat rates for the whole state?
JC: No. The only thing that's a flat rate for the state or a con-
curring type rate is in your toll rates. All independent comp- anies concur with the B.ell System so that everybody charges the same type of toll rates on a mileage-type basis and across state lines and so forth. Now the other ones are very much at random. I'm not certain that we've got the lowest local rates in the state of Utah, hut I'm certain we almost do. We're right now preparing a rate increase. We haven't had one since 1957. We
had a slight rate increase in private line, business rates. I think it was seventy-five cents a month. We haven't had one s.ince then. The only reason we hadn't been in a position to
have one until now is because our toll volume has just packed

 J .
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 29
the local service so the company has made a good rate of return, very good rate of return. Now we're down now to about a 6.5 percent rate of return on our investment and we are now preparing for a rate increase that will hopefully be in effect by the first of January. It's not going to be a large one. The average private line, business rate we'll probably raise a dollar a month. A private line, business rate in the Utah Telephone Company, I
think is $16.00 a month in Tremonton, Utah. We're getting $7.00 see? We're hopefully going to get about $8.00 or $8.25, something like this. We're going after just the rate of return, to get our rate of return up to what the coilililission will allow. With the
cost of money and everything they've become a little more lenient giving a rate increase. When you could get 4.5, 5 percent money,
a 6.5, 7 percent rate of return was a good rate of return--from
6.5 to somewhere around 8 to 8.25 percent, which isn't unreasonable.
Yes, we're very much limited by the Public Service Connnission in
everything we do.
SG: Did you have much of a problem with them during this period when
all these other problems piled up on you?
JC: Yeah, but they were very good to work with. They could see what
we were in, you know. There just wasn't anything that even God Almighty could do about the problem, so they were quite easy to

  J .
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 30
deal with. As a matter of fact, so was the public. When you look back, you have a few hardheads, but you still have for that
matter. They wouldn't be happy if you gave them the telephone service. But the Public Service Commission has been a real fine bunch of gentlemen to work with. They have their problems. Someone complains to them, they've got toá get an answer. I know there were a lot of complaints during that period of time, but people knew that it didn't do them any good to complain. It was just a matter of time. Some people were of the opinion that all
you had to do is just do it. You know, just do it. Well, it wasn't quite that simple. First of all, you had to have the money to do it. Secondly, you had to wait till the darn stuff could get here. There were a few people that weren't reasonable at all, but most people were. Oh, we took a terrible ribbing. We couldn't go out in public, you know, without really catching the devil. But most of it was just in fun. A lot of it wasn't. But they all laugh about it today. Almost weekly somebody will refresh their memory about when it used to take them eight or ten hours to call Salt Lake City; they laugh about it now. It
wasn't very funny then. I~augh] Wasn't very funny to us, either. SG: How have relations heen with Grand County and San Juan County and
the other cities?

 J . WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 31
JC: Real good. Real good. We've always been able to get along with the county people and the city. We try to maintain a good working relationship with them, try to cooperate with anything that they are doing and keep them informed on what we are doing. It's really been quite good. There has been very little trouble. I try to keep the county connnissioners of all the counties and the city fathers and whoever it may be, the mayor, the city manager, or
whatever, try to keep them informed as to where we are, what our problems are, and what we're doing about them, so that they don't have to get mad and do something about it. For instance, two years ago I met with the city council out in Dove Creek and ex- plained to them what we were doing and what our plans were. So you keep them informed and tell them where you are, what you're doing, and what you're going to do next year and the year after, and so forth. We try to work with all the chambers of commerce
of the towns in order to keep a good relationship going. We try to keep in close touch with the newspaper people. About the only newspaperman that we have any prob.lem at all with is one that runs a little paper out in Dove Creek, Colorado. But we haven't had
a real bad time. He'd come in--he doesn't even live in the town, he lives in another town around Cortez someplace--and he got after

 J. WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 32
me personally in the paper here about three years ago. I answered him with a letter to the editor and explained the whole thing. We were having some problems out there, but we were getting after them, doing our best to take care of them. He was completely unreasonable. But I found out later, and even the city council people told me that he's just that type. If he's not after you, he's after somebody else. He's jus:t a crusader-type guy and has always acted this way.
He gets after the city, the county, the sheriff's deparrment, any-
body. He doesn't care as long as he's keeping people moving.
SG: Keeps them hopping?
JC: Keeps them hopping. So other than that, we just get along great
with the news media. We try to keep them informed with what we're doing so they let the people know. Oh, it's kind of funny. You announce a 3.5 million expansion program, and you tell them that it's going to be over a six-year period of time. Three months later they want to know where it all is. It should have happened, it should be all done. It's been three months since you announced it. So we have to keep them informed as to where we're going
with it, how far along we are. Continually, we have to do this. People are just plain funny. You tell them something, and they don't pay any attention. You try to keep them informed in the newspaper and so forth, and they don't read it. I had an attorney,

 J .
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 33
mái ;n d you, get after me. It wasn't any big problem. We had closed down our toll center at Monticello. It was just nothing but a bottleneck. We had switchboard operators up there. We had been announcing for two years that we were closing this toll center down and were going to trunk everything into Moab and have one major
toll center with fifteen positions of switc~board sitting in here. We were going to take those three little switchboards out and move them down here where they belong. We would truck everything right into one major toll center so that you didn't have to go from, say
Mexican Hat to Monticello to get an operator, where she then would turn around and ring the Moab operator. Then you could go out on a DDD call somewhere. We wanted to get it all right into this
one hub for many reasons. The only way that we can ever get to direct distance dialing for a customer is to get it to one spot. Everything has got to come to one central point, see? So we had
been announcing this, telling them all about it: what it was going to cost, how we were doing it, where we ~ere going, how long it was going to take. And we did. We made the cut in Octob.er. Last Oc- tober, they cut that toll center out and brought everything in
here. We had told them what this thing was going to cost repeatedly in the paper, by word of mouth, and everything else. And this man
writes me a letter and tells me, "all you did is take this out to s.ave money, and you haven't spent a dime." It only cost us $600,000

 J .
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 34
to do it, you know. We put in a microwave system between here and Monticello with thirty-six circuits on it. We put in $120,000 worth of switchboards here to handle the traffic and everything. We didn't spend a dime. An intelligent attorney! Well, after I explained it to him for ten minutes on the telephone, why, hell, he's been a real fine guy to work with every since then. So people don't listen;
they don't pay any attention. All they want to do is when they pick up a phone, they want to get what they're after, and they don't give a darn what it costs to get what they want, which is no more right. But when you try to keep them informed and they don't listen, it makes you wonder.
SG: At this point, do you have any way of estimating what percentage of your business is related áto the uranium industry?
JC: Well, let's see. Would you mean the percentage of people actually in the town that might be affiliated with uranium directly?
SG: Yeah, that's more what I was thinking.
JC: Well, I'm going to take a guess.
SG: Well, that's all I could ask for.
JC: I would say that a third of our gross revenues would come directly
from or would be somehow connected with uranium.
SG: If you were to extend that to indirectly how much? Up to half
mayhe?

 J .
JC:
SG:
JC:
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 35
Might even be. It's so hard to measure because there are so many people that are not directly connected, but if it wasn't for the uranium industry, they wouldn't be here either. It's really diff- icult to tie it down to anything.
Would it be safe to say that all the expansion that was here say from '52 to '55 was uranium related?
Oh, you bet. Every bit of it. All of it was. Every bit of it. There wasn't anything at all clear up through--oh gosh, well, let's see, before Texas Gulf came in in '59, I think, something like
that, or '60, almost exclusively up to about '58, '59, it was all connected with uranium. It had all been created either directly or indirectly from uranium. The tourist business really wasn't going
by then. It was either uranium or--well, maybe I should clarify this. There was some oil and gas activity in that area, too. But
most of it was directly connected with uranium.
You think this one-third figure will remain constant for the next few years, or do you look for that to go down?
Oh, I wouldn't think it would b.e too far-fetched as long as it stays. like it is right now.. I'd still say that probably one-third of that is connected directly with uranium. The other splits b.etween the potash, the tourism, and just various and sundry things that are here because of all of them. But I wouldn't hesitate to
SG:
JC:

 J . WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 36
say that probably a third of our gross revenue come out of something
connected with the uranium industry.
SG: Are there any other problems that you remember that were caused by
the uranium industry?
JC: In particular with the telephone company?
SG: Well, the telephone or anything else.
JC: Well, it caused problems for everyone, grocery stores, gas stations,
everyb.ody, as far as that part's concerned. Motels--you make any-- thing and it caused them prob.lems. It just took a certain amount
of time to get to it. Other than what I've pointed out as far as
the telephone company is concerned, it was just the tremendous
influx of people and problems and things that hit us all of a sudden that could not be handled. It just took us about two years to bail out, even to start to bailing áout. It was murder for about two
years. It eased up. It continued for a long time to be a problem, hut it finally worked itself out. Now it's down to a natural growth that we're experiencing, a nice, healthy growth every year. But there was nothing that was a major insurmountable problem that couldn't be taken care of in time. It was just like dumping a thousand gallons of water into a hundred-gallon tank. It just
wouldn't fit, you know.

 J .
SG:
JC:
SG:
JC: Well, not that I can really think of. I would like to give you
some of this history for back-up. You might want to add to this tape some of these particular specifics that we haven't covered.
I ' d like to give you two or three copies of these various different
his:tories that were written for different reasons, financing primarily. Just kind of give you a running history of what's happened since about 1949. In fact, it even goes back further than that. You might want to add to this.
SG: W ell , thank you very much.
WALLACE CORBIN PAGE 37
So as things stand now., the future for Midland Telephone looks pretty good?
It looks very good, very good. I think we'll continue to have a nice, healthy growth every year, as far as the foreseeable future is concerned. I'm very optimistic about the country and what's going to happen.
Any other comments you'd like to make?
