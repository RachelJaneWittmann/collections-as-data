  T H I S I S AN INTERVIEW WITH MR. DANIEL MEYER I N THE KEARNS BUILDING IN SALT LAKE CITY ON JULY 28, 1970 AT EIGHT 0 ' CLOCK IN THE MORNING FOR THE UTAH-CAL STATE FULLERTON URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT . THE INTERVIEWER I S MITCH HADDAD.
MH: Okay, Mr. Meyer, the first thing I'd like to know is a little bit about yourself.
DM: Well, I'm of Swiss parentage; my brothers and sisters were born in Switzerland. And I was born in a little community outside of Milwaukee, Wisconsin--Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, a few days after the folks landed from Switzerland. We were poor by any standard. I don't think we knew it though. We were a very fortunate
family. Had a lovely family. Had none of the normal pleasurable assets like a car. We walked everywhere. We did those things, but we probably had the most profitable childhood that any young guy could ever have because you had love, and you had affection, and you had time. My dad worked two jobs. He made my shoes. But when you look back at it, these are the things that really gave you the ambition to go out and work, work, work. And then work became fun because it was a pleasure to contribute. And all through my boyhood we worked. No child labor law case
on me. I worked for several years from the age of twelve to fifteen without a single day off. I worked 365 days a year. And I wasn't complaining. This was during critical periods of high school when it was

 DANIEL MEYER #1
important to--oh, to do the extracurricular activities that students get to participate in. I was denied these, but I wasn't really denied, I just had to work harder for them. I went out for the track team. I never got to practice. I just went out to
meets. That meant I had to do my running at hours when everyone else was sleeping. And there are things this way that have helped me a lot and are really pluses and not minuses. And so I'm always offended by the people who tell me about the poor. We were always very, very poor. But we wanted something. And slums are made by slummy people. We never lived in any bad conditioned area. We lived in homes which are today very, very poor. They would be called ghettos. But everything was clean. Our clothes were always clean. Always. But that's done through work, and pride, and integrity. And so my background is a happy one. And it's a joyful one. And when I had the opportunity to go to school, I really have to honestly say that the service helped me. The G.I. was a blessing to me. And I went to school because I wanted it very deeply and
desperately. And I think this has been an advantage too. I went through college in two years instead of four. The G.I. paid you by the number of days in school, and you were entitled to so many days
2

 DANIEL MEYER #1
depending on your service record. So I was able to go through college and law school just because I was willing to take thirty units. Of course, the school made me get A's in seventeen and I had to start doubling up. And yet there I made student body president in the two year period rather than in the
four. So you can do things if you just try. And it was a lot of fun.
You graduated from San Diego State?
Uh huh.
MH:
OM:
MH:
OM: Yes, I went to Cal. I went to Hastings Law School,
And also San Francisco Law School, correct?
and I was editor of the law journal there, My bride just newly married about four or five months became pregnant, something we hadn't anticipated. And we
were very poor again. We had nothing. We had a real tough time. And so I had to leave. And this was a very, very tough decision because it was something that I was wanting so ábadly. I had pointed everything I had in life toward law school. But that has blessings too. I went to Standard Cal, and finished in night law school. So I didn't get hurt. I perhaps had benefits. So you can always take the dark side of the moon, you know, and find some little pearl on it, and it makes everything worth while.

 DANIEL MEYER #1
MH: Now when was your first experience with the mineral
industry, or especially per se the mining industry? DM: Well, this is a development. I think that people always feel that a college education gives you something. It does--but what it really does it whets your appetite. If it does less than that, it has failed miserably. If you feel you're fully educated after college, it has failed miserably again. Because the people have just not done the reading. The more
you learn, the more you realize how little you know. I think this is what enticed me into the minerals field more than anything else. I had some background in it from college, but it was an opportunity to make money. I went with Standard. I worked very, very hard for Standard. I did everything I could to work for my boss, not for my fellow man. It wasn't a popular worker. You can't come in and be the first in the morning in and the last one out at night and be popular with the fellow sitting at the next series of
desks when you're an underling. The popularity things is just like now, it's mass mediocrity, it's don't rock the boat. What are you trying to do, show off? And the answer is yes, yes, exactly right. I'm trying to impress the fellow above me somewhere and trying to do the best I can so I can get more money. But my
4

 DANIEL MEYER #1
philosophy has always been that you've got to give that other fellow a dollar and a half for every dollar he pays you or you're cheating him. He can't afford to give you a raise. So I did work hard and assumed additional responsibilities and duties and an opening came up way way above my station. It was a tough job, and I got it. I just said, "Listen, I'11 take over this for a while until you can find a replacement." Well, everyone's always willing to let the other guy do a little bit more work, and so everybody laughed and snickered because I was already overloaded but I took on the Alaskan chore when Alaska was not a popular place. Every fellow up there had always stubbed his toe because thing were too expensive, budgets were being cut, and projects always cancelled. But I took it on in addition to my normal duties, and we made a go of it. And pretty soon I got involved in things like writing the mineral leasing act for the territory of Alaska on statehood. And this gives you a great insight into the complexities of the mineral world because you have to know in order to write about it. When you're
writing law regarding it, it's very important. So I became very closely allied with the federal application of the mineral leasing act. And this was
5

 DANIEL MEYER #1
my first step out when I when I went to Standard and
it was a very unpopu~ar thing because it was tedium and boredom, and laws on public domain were not well handled. I think they were well handled very, very early in the stage when we didn't have a bureaucratic form of interpreters running around trying to see how much you could take away from the words rather than add to them. In the old days, the idea was if a man came out and tilled the land and cut the trees and cultivated so much of the land, and lived in a house that he built with his own hands for ten months of the year, up in Alaska eight months of the year, and you went through the rigors of hell to build that crop, to literally hew it out of the rock, the land was yours. This was the way our land was founded. Going all the way from the time that the settlers landed at Plymouth Rock, what you could handle and till was yours. Our laws gave rise to this. Now all of a sudden our bureaucratic form of government is looking at ownership rather than management. And if you look at just the---?--- clauses of the Mineral Leasing Act, for example, it is to dispose of the public lands. You know, when the government comes into our state--I love the state of Utah dearly, its been very, very good to me. I came here in '57 and
6

 D A N I E L MEYER # 1
I've loved every minute of it. But when you recognize that the government owns about 72 percent of this state that is not tax-bearing, it means that the few people here have to ápay taxes to support a whole state and we're really only a fraction of the state. We're not a whole state. We don't control our own
land or our own destiny at all. The federal government does. And they contribute nothing, and I mean literally nothing. For the people to administer the federal land, they take the money out of your pocket. And then they administer it. And so consequently instead of helping us, it hurts us. Of course, the old butterfly catchers back in New Jersey, they'd like to have all land kept as their private reserve now. This is their vacation land. Don't develop it. But how can we get to the same status that they have without hurting every citizen in this state? They have been able to develop their resources, because the land again came to the people. The people will develop things. The government does nothing constructive. They administer only. They tear up and malign. And I believe in a strong government, mind you, but what I'm saying is I don't believe that you can have a bureaucratic form of government working efficiently. It just isn't possible. It's the
7

 DANIEL MEYER #1
old adage that that government is best which governs least. And here out in the West we've got a tremendously painful problem, and that is, that the people can't even develop the land. You can't have a farm now. Let's say you go out and you decide you want to have a piece of land, and you're a very poor fellow, and you've got a wife and six kids, and you set up a tent and you start to apply for land that is open and you go through all the programs. The chances are 99 percent that the government will take it away from you. Let me go through a little case. I was at Shellbourne Station in Nevada here about three years ago. And I noticed some people in tents. There were three cars and some people in tents. And many, many kids. One family had nine children. Another had five. I don't recall what the other one had. Beautiful little children. Very poor. And these people had come from the Midwest. They decided to make their own mark, and they staked out some land in the valley, the Long Valley in Nevada, right north of Ruth and
Hamilton. And they started tilling the land. They cleared the sagebrush. No tools, mind you. All by hand. They had no tractors, no heavy equipment. It was all done by hand. And boy, you pull out a sagebrush by hand, and you've got yourself a fight.
8

 DANIEL MEYER #1
You just can hardly do it by hand. They didn't have money for horses. Well, I had some food in the car and I shared that, and went about my business--I had some mines down in Hamilton. I came back about a week and a half later and here they were again. And so I went out again and got a pile of groceries and left them for them. About a year later--not quite a year, about eight months, I guess, I went back there and the land was beautifully tilled. A small piece. They had planted their crops. But it took them so long to do their job that they were late in getting their crop in. You have a very short growing season at that altitude and in those valleys in Nevada. Consequently, their crop frosted before they could really harvest it, and they didn't get the food that they needed for the winter and needed in order to sell the crop to produce a bartering arrangement. So again, you have some people that have tried. But you
know the government c.ame in and kicked them off the land. On the basis that they were not complying with the Homestead or Desert Entry Land Laws. A tragedy. Another case--and incidentally I went to bat for them and I lost. Another case a few years back a farmer under the legitimate Desert Entry Land Law which requires that you find water. You have to irrigate a
9

 DANIEL MEYER #1
certain percentage of the land; you must cultivate a certain percent of the land, you must put it into crop; you must find water. You must develop water-- this is the condition preceding it. This is the consideration to the government. Producing water. Something someone else hasn't done. And so the land was available under the Desert Land Entry Statutes, and so they came out and they spent all of their fortune. They had a little bit of money because it takes money to drill for water, and they developed water. They found it, and they put crops in and they were successful crops. And after the third year, they had complied with everything, and now a federal land adjudicator came out to determine whether or not they would get their patent under the Desert Land Entry Law. He took some soil samples and so forth, and he made a determination which I think is absolutely criminal. The determination was that ultimately because the land was not good it was too alkaline, that ultimately they would fail. Maybe ten or fifteen
years later they would fail. So consequently they didn't get their patent. And I went to bat with them, and I flew to Washington even because I was so obsessed. I just couldn't believe it. Now here you have a bureaucratic fellow sleeping in a big house on
10

 DANIEL MEYER #1
a big, fat expense account, driving a nice government car out there, and he takes a soil sample, and he's telling the people who have just produced a crop, who spent every cent that they had for years, and they had drilled the land and had done backbreaking work and had lived under horrible conditions to develop that land that ultimately they would fail. And you know, Mitch, therein lies our whole philosophy of life--mine--the right. to try and the right to fail are the biggest rights that our constitution gives us. Not the freedom of speech and the freedom of religion. Those things are all encompassed within the other. But the right to try something and the right to fail. This is what makes me a free man. I can do anything in the world I'm man enough to do. I can go on out and I can become a bridge builder, or I can become an astronaut. If I'm man enough to do it and I'm bright enough to do it, I can try anything. In Russia, you can't. You're assigned a job and you do that job and you have no choice. You can't say, "I don't like my boss. I want to try this job." You can't quit. Here you can quit. You're a free man. And
here you have the government literally telling someone who has succeeded that you will fail and take the land away from him. And so I think our public
11

 DANIEL MEYER #1
land law is in a despicable state, not because the original law was badly worded, but because it's been interpreted out of context.
MH: Then what you're saying is that the law of 1870 was a good law basically?
DM: Well, I'd say it was good under the circumstances if we could interpret it on a continuous basis like, like it is now being interpreted, like it was interpreted, yes. Yes, I think that the whole idea of the Bureau of Land-- get that--Management, not to own and possess and get bigger, control, but to manage it and to dispose of it for the public good. This is what we need. You know, all you have to do is go to any other country, go to Switzerland, every single little mountainside at almost precarious levels is cultivated. Well, go to Israel and watch what they've done with a very, very bad-looking desert. And you go right next door into Syria and Jordan and into Egypt, and you find the same land that all of a sudden isn't green. It shows a people who have desire, who have the personal fortitude and integrity to fight it out. You can make that land bloom and all of a sudden, you
got a garden. It's just like myself. I come to this state and I leave Standard ultimately, and I'm very pleased with Standard, I left them only because I
12

 DANIEL MEYER #1
wanted to see what I could do on my own. And people say, "Well, Dan, you lucky son-of-a-gun." But you know--and there's a little bit of truth in that too.
I guess I'm a lucky guy. I've been lucky all my life. I had the greatest parents in the world, the greatest brothers and sisters, fine associates, a great lovely wife and fine kids. Just a great life. But the harder you work, the luckier you get, Mitch. And now everyone says, "Well, you' re lucky Dan." Okay, I' 11 buy that. I can't deny that. But now I don't have to. I still work twelve to eighteen hours a day. I mean seven days a week. But you know, Mitch, I'm on a perpetual vacation. I don't work because I enjoy what I'm doing. And if you like what you're doing and you
work very hard indeed, you've got the greatest life in the whole world. Then those few hours I do permit myself with myself and my family--and they're precious few--are very, very fine. I think my kids would feel that I contribute time to them. It isn't as much as a lot of fathers because I'm not often sitting around in a chair with a tall drink in my hand reading the newspaper. I just can't afford that time. I've got too many things to do, a few mountains to climb, a couple of books to write. I think I've got something to say, and I just don't have enough
13

 DANIEL MEYER #1
time. I've got to use--I've to utilize my time while I'm still young and with energy. So that's basically my philosophy. I think it's too much and too verbose and I hope you forgive me for it.
It's excellent. Now you were explaining why you came to Utah. Why don't you continue there because I'm sure that has a lot to do with the mining industry. Well, I came to Utah for Standard Oil as contract and title supervisor for the Rocky Mountain States. I was promoted by standard, but I chose to leave the company and form a consulting firm. And I started out with no clients like anyone else who hangs out a new shingle. I went in as a mining and oil consultant. And, of course, a consultant is only someone with a client. I was kind of presuming I had a client. I hadn't had one. But things were busy. You can always find work. But it gave me in my initial few months a chance to do some of the things that I needed to do. I needed to research and know my area. I knew it very
well from the oil standpoint and my training was in oil, but I needed to learn it from the hard rock point as well. And ,you know, every time you go anywhere, you're going to get an idea. You're going to get--if you're at all careful with yourself, everything you see is going to leave an impression.
MH:
DM:
14

 DANIEL MEYER #1
And you're going to formulate ideas which are the result (?) your own training. And this has happened. We had the Pure Oil discovery here in '57, which was down in the Big Indian Mining District in San Juan
County, Utah. In fact, I was right on land and in and around the discovery that Charlie Steen had in the Mi Vida Mine, right in the middle of the uranium fields. And, by golly, I looked at some of those mines that were in operation, the uranium mines, and I formed some different opinion from that which were casually accepted. Dr. Merritt and a number of prominent geologists stated that that uranium was deposited in the river channel. All uranium incidentally is deposited with a water action, and so consequently, you have a steam of a lake or something of this nature which is a source for your uranium solutions. But I couldn't believe that. I had some doubts about it because it just didn't have the water action, to me, underground that a river would have had. But then I didn't challenge it too much because I had no economic interest in it. But as I left and went on my
own, then my economic interest began to develop. I met a fellow who had a very novel theory--Jim Hudson of Moab, Utah. And we were both beginning to buy land in the Big Indian Mining District. When I say buy, I
15

 DANIEL MEYER #1
mean to locate mining claim or to buy existing mining claim locations, or options on them where we had to drill or do something. And we were competing with one another and we decided to put our chips together, and
so we did. And Jim is 'old school'. Jim's a real great guy. His education is nil. His father was an oiler driller in Oklahoma, ---?--- Oklahoma on the old Indian reservation there, a great independent oil country there, and ever since Jim was ten or eleven or twelve, he was living on rigs. Very nomadic, go wherever the drilling was. His father would utilize the help that was cheapest, and that was his own son. So he pulled the kids out of school and used them as drillers. And this is a tough life for Jim, but it gave him a practical experience. That's fantastic. Again, it's the same type of fortunate circumstance I had. So Jim was involved in the old original uranium strike. His uncle, Bill Hudson, was one of Charlie Steen's "partners." I think they sued each other on the basis of being partners, and I think there was a settlement and money passed hands. So evidently there was some legitimacy to the claim. But at any rate, Jim came out, and he and his family discovered the "Louise" and the "North Alice" and a few other mines in the Indian Mining District. And most of it ended
16

 DANIEL MEYER #1
up in Dad's hands, though, and I think Dad promised the kids they would have such and such interest, but Dad kind of took advantage of the kids a little bit. And so Jim was always excited to go back, and he finally settled down in Moab. His background was one of prospecting, and mine was one of slightly additional technical factors. And he came upon the conclusion that the Long Hill verified theories which were totally erroneous. One of the huge faults down there that the northeast side did not drop, that on the other side, the southwest portion of that fault
"rose"; it was a hinge fault. Well, this was contrary to all other theories and we also developed the theory that this was not a river but a lake. And that your own Big Indian anticline was the highpoint of this, and of course, the fault bisected that huge anticline, and consequently when all the ore was found in the mossback of the Chinle or the Chinera
(?) on the other side of the lake, there'd be the same ore volume. They just turned, as it will. And in a lake will always have the same elevation. So we spent a little time doing elevation studies in these ancient mines, some of which were still operable, some of which were not. We found that all the ore down there was within a seven foot elevation. It just
17

  DANIEL MEYER #1
confirmed everything we would turn around to do, and of course, we said so. Charlie Steen laughed and kind of abused us a little bit that way. Dan and Jim were doing things in his back yard, and we didn't know what we were doing. And Sam Taylor of the Moab Times kind of laughed at us a little bit. Atlas was pretty cruel. Atlas Minerals in fact did us a great deal of harm. They agreed that for the information we would develop on some of the holes that they were drilling, they would run the samples, and build a lithologic log for us, if they could also have the information. It was a two-edged. sword. Well, they got the information, but they never built the log for us.
Then they destroyed the samples and we couldn't even built our own log. And of course, this was a very treacherous thing for a company to do. They thought we were promoters and didn't know what we were doing, and indirectly they were right. Every discovery in the world is a hypothesis. But you don't know. You think, you believe, and boy, when you put every cent you own into the ground, you're believing. But we were still promoters. We were--well, we were something in their backyard, which if we successful would severely embarrass them. I think this was the crux. Well, we went ahead and did it. We
18
doing were

 DANIEL MEYER #1
spent about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars more than we had. We were in trouble. The ground was heavily faulted, we lost circulation, the drilling contractor we had had prior bills from other operations--he went broke, we no longer could do anything viably, but by golly we succeeded.
[INTERRUPTION]
MH: Okay, now we got as far as when you came to Utah in 1957.
DM: Well, of course I came, as I said earlier, with Standard Oil of California, and left them and formed a consulting firm. I guess we get into that area though. When you start a consulting practice, you really go on a hope and a prayer of selling services. And services are only saleable if you can do something for someone that he can't do himself, or hat someone isn't already providing an answer for. And so really an oil and mining consultant is a strange breed of cat. He's got to, by the nature of his business, become a management consultant. Ninety- nine percent of all the problems in all companies are
management, nothing else, what you're going to do, generally you're going to find out that the ore body
19

 DANIEL MEYER #1
was not minable by the given method of mining and the practice wasn't followed, or you're going to have certain hard geologic decisions to make, bu~ really
it all comes back down to management again. Someone failed to do something at the right time, and the company is now in trouble, and what are you going to do? A good case in point is Texas Gulf Sulphur on their potash. Those who were even remotely knowledgeable knew the ore body, the potash was on the lading (?) it wasn't on a flat level plane. And yet because the big boss of Texas Gulf Sulphur drew a straight line, everyone thought, "Well, geez, evidently it's a straight ore body," and even though the people that did the actually work knew it shouldn't have been, or couldn't have been, they didn't challenge it. They didn't do their job, and everyone was afraid of displeasing the boss who drew the straight line. Well, it gets right back down to management. Management can be too strong and fail to do its job. And we in the consulting business are an odd breed. Some orient themselves strictly to the technical aspects, and they do very well. Other people like myself tend to get into the managerial aspect where, really, most of the problems are created. And you're going forward, and you're using a
20

 DANIEL MEYER #1
mineral application, but that's it. But in doing this work, you get down into a horrendous line of decisions which embark upon the area that you were talking to us about earlier, and that is the public Mineral Leasing Law, or Public Land Law for locating claims. And right there in a nutshell in the mining claim area you probably have the weakest area in our
federal law system. The original mining laws were designed so that the little prospector with the mule who really didn't know precisely where he was because he didn't have survey point that he could find, and if he could find them, he wouldn't understand them-- but he could say that he located a claim out there someplace and he could tied it by a visual cognizance to a big boulder, tree, or mountain, or some method of triangulation to knowledgeable areas or near a ranch or something. He knew where he was, and yet he could locate a claim in a county, and everyone else in the world, once that claim was filed, was subjected to the knowledge of that claim because of constructive notice in the county records. This was fine. And necessary. You had land offices established then which would be knowledgeable in various areas and they would cover everything from the mining
filings to the Desert Land Entry, the homesteads, 21

 DANIEL MEYER #1
everything, anything dealing with land that was covered by these areas. Then all of a sudden, it started to change, the land offices dealt only with the leasing of oil and gas, and things of this nature. But they no longer became the repository for the filing of mining claims. You don't do that in a federal land office. You do that in the county records. Now all of a sudden you have the federal government whose lands are being recorded in a county. And in the various counties, you have various methods. Some used sectionalized indices, other did not. Some go alphabetically; some have grantor- grantee indices. Who knows? And it varies from state to state and so forth. And yet this is still the plight right now. Now when we brought in our uranium discovery down in the Big Indian Mining District, we had about a year and a half after it was confirmed as a success because Atlas and some of the people were saying, "Well, those guys don't really have it, they're only saying they have it." And this was very embarrassing. But I'm sure a segment of the public
believed this. But all of a sudden it did become recognized that we in fact did have it, and then the law suits started. Now one of the lawsuits contended that the man had been in doing annual assessment work
22

 DANIEL MEYER #1
on his land, had been doing it every year for the four years that we were in there. And believe me, for the four years we were in there, nobody was in there. We were in sole occupation of that land. We were in possession of it, we lived and literally died on it because we gave up everything we owned to make a go of it. And we know no one was ever around there. And yet affidavits are filed in the county records saying that a hundred dollars worth of work had been done on each claim and that work consisted of road building, or drilling, or doing something. Now this fellow who
is now in our state had been filing identical affidavits for six consecutive years. And I have, by virtue of our statues, constructive notice of everything everyone does. But his did not tie to township, range, section where anyone could understand it. But it started so many feet west of a jutting rock in San Juan County, San Juan county merely being the largest county in our state, and one of the largest in the country. And there's no way in the world that a person could have known that this could have covered that particular land. Nor do I believe was it ever intended to cover that land. And you have a lot of people who are devious who file these nebulous mining claims, tying to draws, or a
23

 DANIEL MEYER #1
small stand of scrub trees, or rocks, and these are things that can fit absolutely every single situation. And consequently they formed a cloud on title. And the fellow that really does the work then finds that he has a very powerful adversary in an area, usually politically well placed, who might end up the ultimate owner of his discovery. Now we have contended with the Public Land Law Review Commission- -and incidentally, this is a body that I think is a joke. It took them two years to finish their nominating speeches, it took them another year to get their agenda agreed upon, and what they come up with is going to be a lot of prose with very, very little constructive value. I feel this definitely because I have met with the group so many times, and I feel a
very beautiful lack of confidence in what they will accomplish. And it's a disaster because the money that they spent could well have been put to better use. But I think that they're going to be more sensitive to the pressure groups than they are the actuality. Now you've never seen a band of prospectors together agreeing on anything. This is the last bastion of free enterprise in American who built this country. He's a man who's all along. And I'm reminded of a little cartoon I saw one time of a
24

 DANIEL MEYER #1
fellow where you could see his tracks coming across the wide open spaces and here all of a sudden it said "Keep Out. Atomic Energy Commission." And it, of course, was presupposing this Arizona or New Mexico effort of the government. And he looks at his mule and he said, "You mean that I've been cooped up for three years." Well, this is the type of man that the prospector is. You're not going to get him into a union or to agree or to be as powerful as, let's say, the Sierra Club, who's interested in motivation conservation. So consequently his voice is never going to be heard. And the Public Land Law Review Commission could care a less darn about it because he's not the voter. He's probably out prospecting on voting day anyway. But yet he's the man that makes 90 percent of the discoveries in America. The big companies make about 10 percent. And then they come in with the dollars and they buy him out and buy up everything around him, and it becomes a big company
project. But at any rate, the prospector needs protection. The independent mining man needs protection, and when you protect him, you are protecting America because he is the man who is developing the resources. We said that about 90 percent of all the discoveries are made by the little
25

fellow. And this is .not something that is just a casual figure thrown out. This is a verifiable figure. About 70 percent of all oil discoveries are made by the independent oil man, and then the big companies come in. This is a true statement, and so we've got to worry about him. Well, how do you protect him? If he were able to go into a give office, and here would be a map that he could visually see, and every acre that was taken would be placed on that map, and the open area would be remining that he could file on, this would be the ideal way. This is what Canada does. Everything is done under legal subdivisions. A hundred and sixty acres, three-twenty, six-forty or aliquot parts of that legal subdivision in the case of surveys with lots. And this is what we need to do. But we don't
have that in our survey system. I made a suggestion to the Public Land Law Review Commission that in lieu of assessment work for two years every single person claiming mining claims should file a plat of survey. Now that's in lieu of two years' assessment work. That would mean two hundred dollars per claim in value. Now he could do the work if he wanted to besides, but this would not force him to do any more than we would now be forced to do. And that way, we
26

 DANIEL MEYER #1
would have to file all people with mining claims. I have several thousand claims, so you see that it would be one round to me. But I would have to file plats of survey within the two year period, or my claims would be void ab initio. They would not be voidable but they would be void. And all land which has not been surveyed within that two year period would be open to the public. And you'd start all over again. From there on, however, everything would be tied from north-south, east-west directions, and tied to legal subdivisions. You would only have you old existing claims which are valid which would be under the new system. As those phased, of course, we'd be to a straight system. I think this makes sense.
MH: Is this similar to what Canada has then?
DM: This would become similar to what Canada has. Canada did exactly the same thing when it went, not in the fashion however. The government just said, "This shall be." They started out a little smarter than we
did and then it got complex in their outlying areas, and so they recognized all the claims. And they sent adjudicators out and they said, "Yes, this is a valid claim this man has, and in fact, has done his work." And in Canada, they checked the land to see that you
have done the work; you just don't file an affidavit. 27

 DANIEL MEYER #1
Now there are people in San Juan County who file affidavits on file, ten thousand claims and never set foot on the land in the year in which they file the affidavit. It's a joke. And so when something comes up, they cloud the title, or they prevent the development of that land. So under any law~ you're going to have some people take advantage of the liberalism of that law. And it must be liberal to protect that little man who is out there working for a year or two with scant food, living off the land
who is going to develop those resources. But I think that this is the type of provision that I would like to see the Public Land Law Review Commission come up with. But it's so simple, that it isn't going to happen.
MH: Does the Land Law Review Commission have the ultimate power to repeal existing statues and--?
DM: No, no, they're only going to make recommendations, and that's still in the hands of Congress.
MH: Right. So then--
DM: They will make recommendations, but their
recommendations--I despair what their recommendations are going to have. Like so many people, you can say, you know, "I'm for this," but when you really analyze what the end result is, they're not .for it. For
28

 DANIEL MEYER #1
example, in California, they tie the size of fish nets to teachers' salaries. Now everybody is for teachers because they deal with our children, so you tie in a proviso of the bill to deal with something that nobody give a damn about, and nobody understands because it's technical, and yet it's going to pass because it'd tied to something which is favorable to
the people. And I think the Public Land Law Review Commission will come out with grandiose plans of conserving our wilderness areas and all of us are for that, and all of us are for things to beautify our country, all of us are for protecting the resources we have because we have to not only look at ourselves today, but also the role we're going to play in history. What is history going to record of us? I think, for example, that a thousand years from now or later, historians will say that we lived in a time
when fossil fuels were utilized to produce energy, and we're going to have that philosophy because the way we're handling it, there isn't going to be any more. We waste. We don't burn our fuel properly. Look at coal. People right now--if you'll just go on out to Kennecott and some of these areas and see the fantastic pollution they emit, if you do the same thing and go to Germany and see what they emit,
29

 DANIEL MEYER #1
you'll be shocked. They burn coal also. In fact, it's coal that isn't as good as the coal they're burning here, and here we get about 12 percent of the energy out of what we burn, and there they get 99 percent. But they're also taking out sulphuric acid and they're taking out the last squeal of the pig. It costs a little money to do this, but they then clean up the air. They take out all of the values which are not pollutants, which are going into the air because they don't have the abundance we have. Consequently, they economize and they must take the last value out of that fuel that they're burning. My heritage, as I told you earlier, is Swiss, and I've spent some time
with the Swiss government. I'm very much fond of their method of government. It's undoubtedly, to me, next to ours, the finest in the world, but if you analyze how they operate, it's almost shocking in comparison to the way we operate. Here's a country with no food, a country with no fossil fuels. They did have an oil discovery near Geneva, but it never even paid for the cost of the well. That was the first and only oil ever produced in Switzerland. And so you have a country which is dependent upon others. It's land locked by large strong countries. It has to deal with its initiative to survive. And they're
30

 DANIEL MEYER #1
going very heavily into atomic fuels. Why, they don't even have a reactor! But my proposal to them was that they should buy, and buy, buy, buy u3oa, yellow cake. They should buy the uranium fuels for the future
reactors. Why? Well, again to give them interdependence. Not to become a warlike country, but on the other hand to keep themselves so valuable to the other countries by supplying them electricity that no one would dare bring war against them once they turned the switch. And I think that this is the safeguard. Of course, they've done so, and they've bought fuels as cheaply and they've now made a very fantastic paper profit. And soon they'll be able to expand on their present supplying to France and West Germany, and so forth. Electricity from their water
power to electricity from their atomic energy in addition to their water power. So you have a country which has utilized its resources to the fullest. We in this still have a land of plenty and we're careless about what we do. We destroy things, and of course, now we're starting to destroy things with our
waste. But I think that this is part of the problem. But in order to properly preserve our resources, we must first properly find them and administer them. And if we waste our resources, we could waste our
31

 DANIEL MEYER #1
resources not only in improper application of that end product, we could also waste them by defiling our lands so that the next man that comes along to utilize his piece of property has to spend too much money to extract that mineral, making it non- economical so he can't get to it. And this happens in mining quite frequently. Instead of letting one operator going in and operate the area where he could do so efficiently and do so at the greatest economic good for the country, we all sit together and we fight each other. You've seen this happen in Texas in the oil field. Everybody had little tiny areas because, as you know, when texas became part of the union, old Sam Houston was smart enough to say to the federal government, "No, you can't take Texas as a state unless all the land belongs to the state." None of it belongs to the federal government, so we have no public domain in Texas, other than what the federal government bought subsequently from the
people in the state. So everything does belong to the state and everything is taxable and that's why they have no income tax, no state income tax.
MH: There is no state income tax?
DM: They don't need it because they have the land to pay
for their taxes.
32

 DANIEL MEYER #1
MH: Then you're in essence saying this is one of the
biggest discrepancies of Utah's Land Law policy? The
fact that--
DM: Not so much that. It's just that we developed late.
It's that in part, but we developed very late. And now the other states are saying, "No don't develop your state. Don't get to the point where we are." Well, how can we become competitive when other states control us? The federal government is a compilation of all the other states and peoples of our country, and so we cannot develop ourselves even properly. And I believe in multiple use. Take these---?--- lands that brought our uranium discovery on now. In the Big Indian Mining District you have oil. Pure Oil made a fantastic discovery down there. On the surface, however, you've got grazer operating side by side. Then beneath the surface you have uranium, then you have oil, then you have potash. Acre for acre probably the richest area in the world in its various
minerals. Along the fault escarpment you have copper. Micro Copper has no operation down there, so do several others. So in other words, you have a very, very valuable piece of land, but you have several operators on the same piece of land. And we can live side by side and co-exist. The law right now provides
33

 DANIEL MEYER #1
that I may only use so much of the land that I can profitably use. For example, I can't fence off and prevent that grazer from taking the land, but I have to fence it off to keep his cattle from falling into a hole, or I'll injur.e that cow, so I've got to use certain precautions. But you can live side by side and develop properly and very peaceably. And when certain things come up--for example, I had mining claims in the Canyonlands National Park. When they condemned the area for the Nationai Park, they violated all of the basic principles of the mining law. They came up to me and literaliy brought an action to enjoin me from developing my land. Now I
had an investment in that land, did I not? I located the land, I built a road into it, I did assessment work. Now they came and said I had to prove within a
very short period of time that it was commercial. Well, the test of comrnerciability has nothing to do with the old Public Land Law.
MH: It's the legal problem of the marketability of a product, is that correct?
DM: Well, they're saying that it must be commercial today. Now, for example, I never look for anything for today. This is going back to basic philosophy. I never look for anything that's valuable only today.
34

 DANIEL MEYER #1
When I got into uranium, everyone in the country
laughed at me. I was the only man in the United States drilling for uranium. Analyze that. I t' s true . For a three year period no one was looki ng f or uranium except ourselves. Why? Well, if you did find it, you couldn't sell it. The government was the sole purchaser. If you hadn't discovered your uranium by
'58, then you couldn't get an allotment to sell it to the government. And so consequently, if you found it and you couldn't sell it, you would lose money, wouldn't you? It would be a nothing. But I projected that uranium would be in short supply in the early seventies. Well, the lag time on producing something and looking for it is about five to ten years. So I started looking in advance, projecting the change in the supply and demand. I project now, for example, that in 1975 or so, you're going to have a beryllium shortage and a titanium shortage. Well, okay, those races are already ovir. But the general mass of the public won't even become aware of it until just before it's critical. But when they start to look, they'll have found that the major, principle deposits of those two minerals are already gone. I'm one of your largest holders in both situations. But I've spent three years now looking for that, and if I find
35

 DANIEL MEYER #1
it, and I have, I can't even sell it. Beryllium right now is a glut on the market. Our country has entered into treaties with Nigeria and others whereby we deal with the other countries rather to protect our own natural resources on the basis of "Wel1-, I've got to protect them from going communistic."
MH: That's similar to what we almost did first with uranium as well. They had the large deposit in the Belgian Congo, and they thought it was so valuable, so ultimately valuable, and when that happened the value of American uranium went way down, didn't it?
DM: Yeah, sure.
MH:
DM:
I mean all of a sudden they found out that it really wasn't enough.
Well, this happens. It's just like our country not to many years ago spent a great deal of money to say that there was no tin in any of the states, an absolute lie. And yet the Bureau of Land Management came out, and the Bureau of Mines came out and made reports and studies and conclusively determined that
there was no tin. The administration at that time went ahead and signed long-term contracts for the purchase of tin from foreign powers. When, in fact, we do have tin. And in order to make the statement, we practically had to preclude anyone from
36

 DANIEL MEYER #1
successfully operatin9 a tin mine in Alaska, in New Mexico. Our country does things in devious methods sometimes, but we try to justify it by our political philosophy. But I think those are rare and I think they have a small affect on what we really do. I think our country is great and I'm proud of it. But I think in the area of Public Land Law, we have a long, long way to come, just to get down to a solid base where everyone can totally understand the law where
it can be viably productive for our country and where that little fellow who takes a big, big, big risk-- and I mean, Mitch, a hell of a risk, and I can only cite to you one case, and that's my own. I don't know how else to do it, but I'll tell you it's what keeps me going every time I think of it. We were drilling down in the Big Indian and the drilling contractor had gone broke and we were stuck and we had lost circulation and we were fishing for our tools and it
was the last dollars we had. I promised my wife I would never paper the house, I would never put a mortgage on the house. This was the one thing that I'd let along, so that she'd always have some security should anything happen to me. And I called my wife and it was in early December, and I said, "Honey, I'm in trouble. Would you go down to the bank
37

 DANIEL MEYER #1
and sign a mortgage. " And she said, "Is it necessary?" And . I said, "Y es." And without any question, no griping--because had she griped one word, I would have stopped. I had to, because you have to have support. She went on down and she mortgaged the house. Well, we spent that money. I'm still in trouble. It didn't solve my problem. It just went a little way toward solving it. Got to me just before Christmas. I didn't have a present for my kids. This was in '64. And I've always been very close with my children. And I called home and I told the kids I wouldn't be home for Christmas. And my little girl, God bless her, she said, "Daddy, did we spend Christmas?" And I said, "Yes," because I never 1ie to my kids. She said, "Did we spend vacation too?" And I said, "Yes". And she said, "That's okay, Daddy. Do your job and come home quick." And we went out and we later brought it in. Had she said, "Please
come home," or had she less courage than I had, it would never have been happening. We never would have made a discovery. So--
MH: What was the name of your actual first discovery? I know it's a common name. I was just wondering.
DM: We named it Humeca. It stands for Hudson--(Hu), Meyer-- (Me), and Carr-- (Ca) . Carr had helped raise
38

 DANIEL MEYER #1
some money to get the thing done. He was a partner of Jim's that I inherited. So we called it the Humeca Mine. And it will be known as such with Rio Algom. But then after we brought it in--now you've got to realize we were kind of silly looking for a long time
for several reasons. One, no one ever tried to bring it in that deep. That was 2,650 feet. Ore that's of a certain grade and economic value on the surface wouldn't be economic at that depth necessarily. So we were doing things which were a little bit daring. And I think that those are things that are fun. And we brought it in. But how in the hell are we going to sink a shaft to get there? You're looking at many, many millions of dollars. Well, we, I think, played that rather well. It was just about that time President Johnson made a statement that the United States, Westinghouse, and General Electric had the two finest reactors in the world. There were several other reactor companies which were not American. But evidently their reactors didn't meet the same degree of proficiency as ours did. So he made the statement that to protect domestic fuels, if you bought an American reactor, it had to be fueled with American fuels. And this was a proclamation which was going to hold true. Now all of a sudden the bell rang. We
39

 DANIEL MEYER #1
talked to a number of companies: Atlas, right in our backyard; Charley Steen who laughed at us; Kerr-McGee who denied that we had anything; and you know, a number of our strong local companies. And we looked silly out there. We kept saying that we had it, and they kept that we didn't, or if we did have it, it wasn't economic. You know, it was just nothing. But that rang a bell. Where would you go to sell your uranium? It's going to take twenty million dollars to put a shaft down there. To find out what you've got. Well, anyway, we went to Rio Algom which is the world's largest uranium producer. We don't know--I'm talking about free world. Now we don't know about Russia. But they have a fantastically large low grade deposits up at Elliot Lake, Canada and in South Africa. They're very, very large. But now here you had the largest producer, and all of a sudden if all of the reactors were American and they had to be fueled with American fuels, what's going to happen to their deposits? So I quickly hopped on the plane and
got up to Toronto. And from there I hopped a plane and I flew over to London and I talked to Sir Val Duncan, the president of Rio Tinto Zinc which is the parent company of Rio Algom. And finally we convinced them that the way they could become viably strong
40

 DANIEL MEYER #1
would be to get a foothold into American fuels. And
if they would do this, then you could have tradeouts. It's the old routine again. And even though they sold Canadian, maybe they would trade this for that. It's the old import quota system again. If you have foreign production, you get so many, and if you have a local refinery, you get an import quota. Well, a lot of little companies make a lot of money, not on what they refine, but just on selling their quotas. And again it's an artificial method of making money created by a government that doesn't understand the ultimate problem. They do things temporarily. So here was a very foolish ruling by a president who didn't fully understand the economic situation of tomorrow. Today it was a good rule; tomorrow it's a crummy rule. And we do so many things for expediency purposes. So at any rate, I used it to my advantage. And Rio Tinto Zinc is. now shafting. They first spent $1,800,000 drilling to confirm what I had said, whether it was in fact true. And it was. Now they're shafting. The shaft system cost $23,500,000 I couldn't come up with the money, but they can. So what I'm really saying is my job has become a target finder. I've generally done this since I started my consulting practice. The idea is to do some original
41

 DANIEL MEYER #1
thinking, find the mineral. First find what kind of mineral you're looking for. I don't think the old system of just walking over the land and you find something--fine, now I've got copper or now I've got lead or zinc or fluoride or anything. That's not the way. It's a way, but I--I would rather go the other way and find out what I need and then specifically look for it. And it very much narrows your scope of operations and it's a more intelligent approach to exploration. And then, too, I always believe it would change the risk factor. I don't believe it has to be as risky as everyone make it out to be. I think the risk factor can be minimized by the application of good principles and thought. So this has been our approach. So I'm traditionally looking for the wrong mineral in the eyes of the mineral world. I'm always looking for something that has almost no application today, but is going to be very, very valuable tomorrow. Lituminous sands is a beautiful example. Titanium, beryllium, the uranium before. These are all things that are going to be tomorrow's great
minerals. But today it's--you know, they say, "Well, Dan, you're supposed to be looking for copper." And I have a lot of people that walk in my door and say, "W ell, where can I find a good copper deposit?" W ell,
42

 DANIEL MEYER #1
they're too late. Good gracious, that was--that was a metal of the fifties. And it still is and will be and will become an even more valuable base metal, but the large discoveries have been made. And certainly there are always going to be more discoveries, but it's easier for me as a little fellow with a small office and a small staff, because I'm my staff, to go out and find something large. And everyone's looking for an elephant, not a mouse.
MH: Do you actually go out in the field yourself? Just out of curiosity.
DM: Oh, constantly. Sure. And then we come up with a principle and then I hire the most competent people in the area to assist me. I have operations going on in six states right now. I can't be everywhere, but I'm everywhere directing. Now I used to have large offices and spread out a little bit, and I all of a sudden found out that I wasn't satisfying my own ego. I have a need to do everything as well as possible. And I found out that I was getting more and more clients, but I was doing less and less of the actual work, and consequently, I don't believe my quality
was high. So one day I became dissatisfied with myself, and I decided to consolidate. And I consolidated to the small offices that we have here.
43

 DANIEL MEYER #1
I decided that I would do everything well, and do far less. I turn away about 80 or 90 percent of the work that comes to me. But everything I do, I do as well as I can. I think, then, that this is self- gratifying, and you know that you can be pleased with yourself.
NH: You know what you're getting into even before you get into it?
DM: Well, I'll make less money. But you see, as in everything, if money is your objective, you ' re a failure to begin with. Keep that in mind always. Always. You have to look first at doing something well. You have three objective in every business: one is to succeed, the other is to not lost money, and the third is to make money. But if you invert any of those three, you're automatically a failure. It must
be in that order. First to succeed in a viable product. To do something well. If your goal is to do it well, then always--and I tell this to company after company, but no one ever listens. No one ever listens, see. This is a theory that I can't seal, but I'm right. And you can just--and this is a good example for you. I want you to challenge this and come back to me at some future date. If you do something well--that's your first objective--your
44

 DANIEL MEYER #1
second objective should be not to lose money while you're doing it well. And your third is maybe you can make some money. But if your objective is to first make money, you're automatically lost. You know, people run around theá streets and say, "Geez, I got a hot deal. I'm going to make a million dollars on this, or a hundred thousand, or a quick short-term profit," I can show you a loser.
MH: Well, isn't that similar to the concept of maturity? Before you walk into a courtroom, you have to have done your job well and researched first; have you case and facts and everything there. You really haven't made any money yet. It ' s al1 been your own time. Isn't it right that because you've done so well in preparing it, you can go in there and make your case, make a precedent decision. Then you make your
money.
DM: A very good analogy, uh huh. But you can't sell this
in business because business is oriented to making money. And they put dollars as the first objective and that's wrong. It's just wrong. And when they do this, they're automatically geared to failure.
MH: Well, also in a way too, trying another analogy, aren't the mining laws, too, ---?--- that exact same thing? They don't allow a man to really--! mean,
45

 DANIEL MEYER #1
they're very liberal on some parts, as you've pointed out, but they're also very strict in others.
DM: Well, right now we're getting into the phase--not only right now, for we've been in there for years. Years before you could take the land to patent, because a man needs to own land and do something well. You can work under a lease and you can work under these criterion, but are you going to move your house onto it? No, I'm going to live in Salt Lake. I don't own that land down there. If I owned and lived closer to it, I'd have a greater chance of success. But I'm not going to build on something I'm not going to own. Now the government says that you have two new laws--two new applications, not laws--because these things come about through these ridiculous bureaucratic interpretations. But they say, one, you
must now produce a mineral in order to get a patent. That's the first wrong statement. And secondly, you must sell it at a profit. They put the commerciability tag on it. And I think that this is erroneous because, for example, in the minerals that I'm looking for right now, there is no commerciability. You couldn't seal beryllium if you
had it. So consequently, I can't take those lands to patent until some long time in the future. Whereas if
46

 DANIEL MEYER #1
I could take it to patent, I'd be paying taxes to a county on it, and I would be developing it earlier. But this is again a federal interpretation, and it's tragic. It's just really tragic because that little prospector, he hasn't got the money. Why, he can't prosecute the patent. It used to be that the patent laws were such that a little fellow could take in and file your patent applications--it cost about fifteen bucks. And he could take and patent his claims, these mining claims. Now he can't any more. Look at Charlie Steen, he got his patents on his Mi Vida subsequent to the closing of his mine. But all the years that he was operating, he couldn't get the patent. And now I've brought in a very large discovery down there. We won't get patents for years. Years and years. And you know what? Even though your application may only be fifteen dollars, in order not to misconstrue the law, you have to have expert people to prosecute these land to patent now, and to fight it through this huge
maze of bureaucratic machinery in Washington. And consequently, it may take ten thousand a claim to patent it. But the prospector, he never has got that ten thousand dollars. So all of a sudden we've taken from him and stolen his birth right, the fruits of
his discovery and of his labor. 47

 DANIEL MEYER #1
MH:
You mean the actual sorting out process now has become so ---?--- The understanding I have of a patent is this: you have a claim which is productive, which is an equitable claim in legal terminology, which then makes this claim valid for a patent.
Uh huh.
Correct? It's been filed properly and everything else. All right, you apply to the federal government with your fifteen dollar fee, and then it is the Department of the Interior--correct?--who takes it, and they more or less go through a process of finding out whether or not anyone has counter claims to your property in a hearing type of session, correct?
Well, that's a part of it. A small part of it.
Uh huh. And then once they do that, I was under the impression that once they establish that fact, they grant you your patent.
Absolutely not. Absolutely not. No, your patent application now, and it's a real curious thing, but aside from the attorneys who are the natural type of people to do this type of fighting for you, a great number of your old governmental Bureau of Mines and Department of Interior personnel set up consulting
offices to help you prosecute these lands to patent. And it takes vast sums of money and a great deal of
DM: MH:
DM: MH:
DM:
48

 DANIEL MEYER #1
time. Because now you go through these commerciability test and productivity test, and none of those were in the original ruling.
MH: The ruling then--the aspects of what I've just cited is the original law, correct?
DM: Yes.
MH: This is the original---?---?
DM: Sure, and you would file it, and the fellow from the
land office, the government inspector, would go down there and say, "By George, you do have something here, Sam. Not bad. Geez, the mineral's a little scant here." The right to try, the right to fail again! But we're forgetting that now because what shows on the surface of my little discovery, and maybe that fifty-foot ---?--- I just sunk into the earth at back-breaking cost, maybe it shows my vein and it shows my mineral, but it isn't big enough to
be commercial by their standards, so I don't get it. But if I keep sinking in it and keep going, pretty soon, I'll have a Kennecott, huh? That was the biggest failure in the world out there for years and years and years. But it was patented by merely showing that there was in fact the minerals that I discovered. And boom. So the predecessors to Kennecott got their á patent. They didn't have to
49

 DANIEL MEYER #1
produce it in any large quantity. You had to have a handful of it. You then also got patents on the neighboring contiguous claims because you know when you get down, it's not going to be just a straight up and down line.
MH: DM:
It's going to expand.
Sure, or if it's a placer claim deposited by water-- and incidentally, there goes another problem. How does a prospector tell? Do I file a placer or a lode claim? And if it's been moved, and I can't tell it's been moved because it's a complex geological factor, I may be filing the wrong claim. And then later some legal beagle will come in and file a placer on top of
my lode and he'll end up with my claim.
So legally what do you have to do to circumvent that? Is there any--?
MH:
DM: You just got to be right. Legally, there's not a damned thing you can do.
MH: There are no stipulations at all?
DM: No sir. And the little prospector, he's often wrong
because he's not a professionally trained geologist. And even geologists are wrong--look at my discovery down here in the Big Indian. I was right across from Homestake's (?) big mine, and here's Homestake's (?) mine right here. Here's my discovery right here. And
50

 DANIEL MEYER #1
they said there wasn't anything here. Here's the fault running through .here. There it's shallow and on the surface here and we're down at 2,600 feet here. And I went in their mine and I could see the sheer marks in the ore. And I told them, "Heck, you got ore

down here," and they laughed at me. And there are professionally trained mining engineers and geologists, and they couldn't see it. Now how's a darned prospector going to see it? And here you're looking 2,600 feet down.
Just out of curiosity, what is your presumed or predicted output of your claims?
Well, I wouldn't say that at all because you have a problem in our fine society. And that is if you declare what you've got, the county can tax it as a present asset.
Well, okay. It's quite large then, right? Would it be safe to say?
Well, would anyone put a $23,500,000 shaft system on something without it being large?
Okay.
You've got to make a ton of money before they make money just on the amortization of that money. Yes, it's very large.
Okay. I'm curious, because your principle is so
51

 DANIEL MEYER #1
applicable, and yet you cannot--they will not grant you a patent on your claim?
No, it's not patentable right now. And I'm still fighting new lawsuits.
I find that, having researched the legal stipulations both federally and statewide as far as Utah is concerned, there is really no legal stipulation which states that you cannot have a patent on--
There is a piece I brought up from 2,642 feet down, right there. It's probably the hottest piece of ore ever mined. It could be that there's been better ore mined. I don't know. This goes 4 percent uranium, and .22 percent is mill grade.
It's chinerum, correct?
It's mossback of the Chinle which Charlie Ronally (?) said was Chinerum. So now we call it Chinerum because it has the common notation of chinerum. You know, you
DM:
MH:
DM:
MH: DM:
MH:
prostitute a mistake and you compound it, but this is not chinerum. No, it's mossback of the Chinle. Everybody says it's chinerum, so let's call it chinerum.
I was trying to check out my--we were to know the geological formations in this--yeah, it's of the Morrison Formation, correct?
DM: No, no, no. Morrison's way above it. Yes, you're 52

 DANIEL MEYER #1
looking at eons of time difference. If you had Morrison ore, which is productive at the Rattlesnake Mine about five miles northwest, but that's--and we started out into Morrison. The brushy basin of the Morrison is right on the surface of this land, and you're going way, way down.
You go way down in periods, right?
Oh yes. Oh yes. You're looking at a great deal of time differentiation between the Morrison and this. Let's see, Morrison is very recent comparatively, and yet here it is. This should be enough to get a patent. Not patentable.
You mean, that's high grade enough ore that it should be patentable right there?
High grade enough? This is the highest grade that we have ever recorded that anyone has ever been able to pull out?
What's the percent compound?
Four percent.
Four?
MH: DM:
MH:
DM:
MH:
DM:
MH:
DM: That's right. And .22 percent is the mill grade at
MH: DM: MH:
the Atlas Mill in Moab right now. I was going to say--
That's fabulous.
So that ore will consistently mine at-- 53

 DANIEL MEYER #1
DM:
MH:
DM: MH: DM:
If our deposit were .22 percent, no one would go down to get it.
Uh huh. And yet that will consistently mine at 4 percent?
No. No. I can't say that. I don't know.
Yeah.
I have a little core which is this way. But you can see here. And it's round and we've sliced it. And this is that. But will it be consistent, I don't know. We have some which is almost nothing. And we have some mud holes in there. We've drilled in and found absolute barren nothing because a shoreline will have eddying, and you're going to have mudpots formed, and they'll be barren. And you see, to have uranium, you have to have a certain degree of
porosity and permeability. Do you understand the difference between the two?
Uh huh.
MH:
DM: Porosity being, for example, let's say we have a jar
full of marbles. Porosity is the space between each marble. The permeability is the ability to communicate from pore to pore there.
MH: Right. Similar to---?--- molecular interaction.
DM: Yeah. So now if you have a dense sandstone or a dense formation, or a mudstone, let's say, and the water
54

 DANIEL MEYER #1
cannot get through to deposit the carbonaceous material which on the secondary classification basis became the uranium, then you have no uranium. On the other hand, if it were too porous, then the water came through with the carbonaceous material, but it flushed it right out again behind it. So it can not be too dense nor too loose. And you have to get the right set of circumstances all the way along. And that's what you have to look for. Here we found it. But within the same mine you're going to have barren places. Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Because of the flush through, right?
or because it never got through.
MH:
DM:
MH: That's just remarkable. You also bring to mind
another question. Okay, there are the legal problems resulting in low placer claims, the cross claiming, as well as, say the difficulties now in patenting. Coupling that with the difficulties of corporate marketability once you have an actual claim, are there really legally any safeguards for a miner today?
DM: Well, I'll tell you. Rio Algom almost pulled off of our land. They almost determined that our mineral leasing laws and our mining were so vague and ambiguous so that no one could give a legal title,
55

 DANIEL MEYER #1
and it was Cal Bailey's firm here that did their legal work, and you should see the opinion. It's fantastic. By the time they qualify everything they've said, it's like saying, "We've come to the general conclusion that--" meaning nothing. They didn't conclude. There are so many loopholes. Our rights are valid only against subsequent rights, not against anyone with a prior right. Our rights are really not rights until they're judicated through the courts when you really get down to it, which is a tragedy because the poor little miner can't afford it. I've spent many, many, many thousands of dollars
prosecuting the right to be on my own land, and the
government gives me no help at all.
MH: So you mean in essence because you do not have the
fee title to your own land, somebody could actually do what was recorded in several cases, actually come and cross claim.
DM: I'm now going to go through another lawsuit on that same land which now has just--in fact, it hasn't even been filed yet. But--
MH: It's been cross-claimed then, more or less?
DM: Sure. And I can't even keep the guy off from
perfecting brand new claims which weren't existence. Now fellows come in and put sticks up on
56
in

 DANIEL MEYER #1
our ground, mining claim stakes, saying, "Well, I had them here before and you must have torn them down or they were knocked down." How can I--what can I do? Jim Hudson told a guy, "Get your tail off my land or I'll kill you." Physically. He called the sheriff and the sheriff said, "Listen, the mining laws are so bad, I can't keep him off your land." Now what are you going to do, shoot him? That's what they used to do in the old days. We just don't go along with that
old bit now anymore.
MH: As a lawyer you can speak both from the knowledge you
have as a miner and a lawyer, and yet what
alternative are really left?
OM: Well, the man making the claims is a lawyer from
California. He has moved to Moab because he can see a bonanza. He has now moved to Moab and he has put mining claims up on top of my place. He claims he was there every year. Now I've been on that land, I lived on that land. And I never saw the man before in my whole life. I've been there since '62.
MH: So now it will become in the end a legal battle?
OM: That's right.
MH: Rather than--
OM: And then all of a sudden, if you're successful, it's
going to become the little guy against the big guy. 57

 DANIEL MEYER #1
And you see, the positions may have switched. Before,
I was the poor guy with holes in my jeans, and hungry kids. Now I'm the successful man because I've done a number of other things which have brought me money. Because that hasn't produced yet, you see, so the money I have has come from other sources. L ittle b its of option moneys and delayed rental money from Rio, but nothing big. So that hasn't produced big yet, but will produce large, and will give me a royalty and the securities that I need. But other moneys that I have made have made me a prominent figure in the community. Now it'll be the little guy that gets me. And I will be the little guy again. Had I fought it in the time and place then, there's no way I could have lost it. Now I'm not sure because our country is such that we're always for the underdog--
MR: Had you tried to patent your claim when you first brought it up, they would have laughed at you, right?
DM:
It's not patentable. I made the enquiries, and I flew to Washington and--no way. I must sell ore. Well, to sell ore, you got to have a mine. I got to get down there. They've been shafting now for a year and a half. The shaft won't be finished--there are two shafts incidentally--that shaft won't be finished until December of this year and then the mill will
58

 DANIEL MEYER #1
have to start. The mine won't be viable until later-- probably early '72, let's say. Then it will become a mine.
MH: This whole complex is Rio Algom, right.
DM: Yes.
MH: And it's still under your mine name?
DM: Uh huh. But--and at that point, once they start
selling the ore, it will then be valid for patenting. But Rio has already done a great deal of work and they've done it through Washington counsel, New York counsel, through Toronto counsel, and through Cal Bailey's firm here in this building. And the conversations that I've been in on indicate it costs so much to patent. It costs more than the land is worth. So ultimately they probably will not patent it. And therein 1ies the tragedy. Therein 1ies the failure to develop a city. You see. Another community
which will be supporting more people in an area that is not populated. And instead of doing something for permanence and doing it well, it will be done as temporarily as it can possibly be done. So we don't throw away any money. And so consequently instead of developing our country, we're destroying our country! The tragedy is just absolutely unbelievable. And this is a beautiful area. If you could see this right at
59

 DANIEL MEYER #1
the base of the La Sal Mountains, one of the most beautiful places on the face of the earth, right in the navel of the Canyonlands National Park literally. Right near Arches National Monument now becoming a national park. It has the most beautiful area in the world. Beautiful climate, fishing, trout streams that aren't visited by ten people a year. It has everything for a beautiful city. This would give it the industrial growth and viability to house people and to give them jobs. But what are you going to do, you're going to say, "Oh no, buddy, no houses, put up trailers." And trailers desecrate the land. I don't care how you cut it. It isn't something that you're going to plant your lawn around and put your trees up and say, "My children are going to grow up here." All you've got to do is go to the Mi Vida, and all these other mines, and all you've got to do is say, "look it, here are the mines." Here is a map of them here that you can see. This is the overall picture. Here
you have all these mines in a straight line going like this. And they all drilled up here and there was nothing. But what they didn't realize is here is the anticline. And the lake went like this around it. Now I own all this land. Ha, own it! I have mining claims on this land ---?--- The other land is owned by
60

 DANIEL MEYER #1
other people. The land here was done by Kerr-McGee. And I can tell you right now Kerr-McGee borrowed my geological report, told me that they would not work in the area competitively and a few days later got these lands.
MH: So that is one side of the lake as you say?
DM: Wel1, sure. Here's the anticline, here's the structural head. These beds are dipping in this
direction, and the mines are right on the outcrop. On this side it comes around and here is the land we're talking about. Here's where we made our discovery. And it's just right on the opposite side of the fault. I went perpendicular to it and there it was, bang!
MH: And it's all within seven-foot elevation, as you said before?
DM: That's right. Originally. But here you have all these little mines. They employed thousands of people. No one is living there now.
MH: Right.
DM: And you go there and you see tar-paper shacks and old
places where trailers were. Piles and piles of garbage cans and waste and so forth. Here's the Mi Vida of Charlie. And you see all the remnants of the people who struggled temporarily. Why not a city? Why
61

 DANIEL MEYER #1
not something beautiful? But you can't because someone in Washington has decreed that that's not patented, so you don't make it worth while to do it at the optimum, and so consequently you do it at the lowest common denominator. And then they say, "Let's protect our country. Let's preserve it, while they're purposely destroying it with their own legislation. And the reason again is because you have this little bureau that wants to preserve its right. Have you ever seen a government grow smal_ler? It's always larger and larger because in order to raise in level, I've got to have two secretaries and I've got to have this many people below me, so consequently you always expand. And you do less and less and less.
MH: Yeah. This is just like your idea of consolidation. Somewhat.
DM: It's just--it's a tragedy. But it will never change. It will never change. It is there. But if the people really want to do something, they would then go back and say let's get back to our basics again. And our basics are to allow the man who is going to take that big risk, the Alva Edison, the Drake. And you know, like Drake, he brought in the oil and he died a poor
man. This has happened in so many cases. Mr. Kennecott didn't die a rich man at all. He died a
62

 D A N I E L MEYER # 1
poor man. And you have this type of a situation. But why not let him have some of the fruits of his labor?
MH: I'm going to have to turn the tape in a second. I have a question. You mentioned before, you know, that it would be possible for people to cross claim. Well, for example, I heard of Charlie Steen, he's making his claims, you know, "reported figures" of so many
hundreds of millions of dollars and this and that. What law really protects a man, say, as yourself who has valid claims who has done both the geological and legal work. You know they' re there, they' re legal. What happens if, say, of Steen were to cross file on you? What protection would you have from that?
DM: I have none.
MH: I mean, are there mining laws existing like--
DM: I have people doing it right now. I have no
protection. I've got to go to court and fight it.
MH: It's a morbid thought, isn't it?
DM: It sure as hell is. And what happens if I hadn't made
some money in some of the other things that I have
done, if I hadn't--
MH: You'd have public opinion on your side is what you're
saying?
DM: Well, no, I couldn't afford the lawyers to fight it
for me, could I? See, that poor little guy is going 63

 DANIEL MEYER #1
to get screwed out of it. And that's the way we're setting it up. I 'm very, very unhappy to say this, but you being in the area and in the field, but the legal rights are rapidly becoming the privilege of the wealthy. The bes~ doctors are going to work on the best people. Now always. You always have the man who will work on the poor man, who will be the benefactor. But it isn't that way. The smart people-- Christiaan Barnard, he's going to operate on the wealthy people who can afford to pay him what his
services are worth in the market place. And since he is in much demand, the wealthiest guy is going to get him. What happened to the poor little fellow with the same problem? And I'm going right back again. The man who is making a lot of people wealthy is that poor little prospector. He's the guy that's got the guts to sweat it out, one meal a day maybe, maybe two, and
no bath. Or if it is, it's in a cold mountain stream. And gut it away from his family, and go through hell to find something. Or the modern day prospector, and I'm that kind of a guy. I do it in a little more comfort--
MR: But you do it with more knowledge.
DM: I don't--you can't do it from a motel room 1ike
Charlie's talking about. He decided he was going to
64

 DANIEL MEYER #1
go back to the field and make some money. He and his sons went out and in the third motel they stayed in on the third night, walking out they made this discovery. Well, that's a joke, you know. When I go
out to the field, fine. I've never found a uranium ore body out in the middle of the Salt Lake. For me to be out in the field I've got to be up when the sun's up and work until nine, ten at night when you can't see any more. And it's day after day after day.
.If I went into town to a motel, my day would be restricted to eight or nine hours because I may have to drive two hundred miles to get from the wasteland into the nearest deal. I'm working on a piece of land right now that is a very valuable thing I think. We may have brought in some little discovery. And the nearest place where I can get a cup of coffee is a hundred and twelve miles on a dirt road. I've already used up sixty-one tires in my field crew of two
people.
money to afford those tires, I couldn't even get in there. You know. You could do it on horseback, or a prospector could do it. And let me tell you something, and this is a putdown of myself, I have
Sixty-on tires?
MH:
DM: That's right. Tearing them up. If I didn't have the
65

 DANIEL MEYER #1
never in my life, for myself or anyone else, ever been to a mining property or look at a prospectively valuable property that didn't already have a hole on it. Some little prospector is already there ahead of you. Always. He was a tenacious bugger that I admire more than--more than anyone.
MH: It's similar to some of those down like around Blanding. You go in there and there's the hole. There's always a small--I'm going to change the tape over.
DM: Okay, very good. I'll get the phone call then.
