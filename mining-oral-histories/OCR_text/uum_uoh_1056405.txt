 THE FOLLOWING IS AN I NTERVIEW CONDUCTED BY SUZANNE SIMON WITH MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C. PRITCHARD ON AUGUST 9, 1970 IN BLANDING, UTAH FOR THE URAN IUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT COSPONSORED BY CAL ST A TE A T FULLERTON AND THE UNIVERSIT Y OF UTAH. [TAPE #1.]
SS: Mr. Pritchard, would you start by telling me something about your own background, childhood, where and when you were born and so forth?
AP: I was born in Joplin, Missouri in 1918 and lived there until I was 23, I believe, and went in the service. After I got out of the service, I came to Palisade, Colorado, where my wife was, and we lived there five years, I believe. Then on to the Atomic Energy in Grand Junction. I was there for about two years in a welding shop and in a mechanics shop and then went to the field for the AEC as a mechanic--all these dates here, I haven't studied them. I don't know exactly what we've got. '51 to--
Energy camp. I was maintaining equipment for the Atomic Energy, mainly it was caterpillars. I wasn't in the maintenance of any of the drill rigs that they had operating.
Did you--were you--let' s see, '51- '53, you were in where, did you say?
'51 to '53, Walkerly Barker in Grand Junction.
BP:
AP: Cove Mesa down in Arizona, a code school. Atomic
ss:
AP: Cove school, Arizona, Cove Mesa.

 MR. SS: AP: BP: AP:
AND MRS. ALFRED C . PRITCHARD # 1
Oh, uh huh. And that's on the reservation, isn't it? Uh huh.
Just what was it, 30 miles out of Shiprock?
From there we went to Bow Canyon, over in Colorado, from September to November in '53. Then we went to Fry Canyon and we talked about Dad's road over Elk Ridge. That's the only one we had in there at that time.
That was in early, or rather right at the end of '53? Y es, November 1 53.
On Thanksgiving day.
We were down there it says here until April of '54. Then we moved to Cottonwood.
You were in Cottonwood how long?
SS: AP: BP: AP:
sometime in '55.
BP: I couldn't remember just exactly when we left
Cottonwood. I don't know when we went to Big Indian, but I know the kids finished through the school year here, so it was in the summer before 1 56, I guess.
AP: We were there until September of '56.
BP: I guess, something like that. Close to that. SS: And then you went to the Big Indian, you say?
AP: Uh huh. I was there until '56.
BP: The kids went one full year to school, so maybe I've
SS:
AP: April, let's see, does that jive? Yeah, '54 until
2

 MR.
AP: SS: BP:
AP:
BP: AP: SS: AP:
SS: AP:
AND MRS. ALFRED C . PRITCHARD # 1 got those dates mixed up.
W ell, maybe.
Close.
They went to one full year of school at La Sal and then he was made an inspector and we moved to Monticello.
In September '56 we went to Monticello and were in Monticello until December '56.
And then that's when it was over.
Y es.
In December '56 that was the end of the--?
That was the end of the job. Everybody got a nice little letter of reduction force and sent us on our way.
That was that, huh?
They were--the Atomic Energy told me that they, nobody could explore this country on their own, that the government had to do it, and that's the reason that they took over and did all this exploration
work. After they got it done and established they
turned it over to private concern.
SS: Well, now through all this time, until you were made
inspector, were you continually doing maintenance work on equipment?
AP: Uh huh.
3

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C. PRITCHARD #1
SS:
Well, let's go back a ways. Maybe I could get you to describe a little bit what each of these camps were like and let's see, starting with maybe the one at Cove. You can tell me about how large it was and whether you were provided housing and this sort of thing.
There were, I think, about 30 government trailer houses down there, and we furnished our own power with a generator and each person had a vehicle. I had to maintain that, and then I travelled from one camp to the other. We were furnished housing and trailer houses, we did our own cooking, carried our own water.
Were most of the people, did they have their families with them or were they bachelors?
No, only a few had their families out there. Most of us batched.
How about Bow Canyon? Was there something set up?
Yes, practically all the camps were the same. There were only a few families in a camp and they were only there during the times that school was out, children
AP:
SS:
AP:
SS: AP:
would be out.
SS: Well, when you went to Fry Canyon, did you take your
family with you there? AP: Y es.
4

 MR. AND MRS . ALFRED C. PRITCHARD #1
BP: I stayed until Christmas then because I had nine in
school and he was staying with some people in Colorado that I didn't think were doing a very good job taking care of him, so then I went back to our ranch and I stayed until school was out. Then I went back out.
SS: Well, did you consider putting your children i nto t he school at Fry?
AP: They didn't have a school there at the time. After it was more civilized.
SS: What was it like in '53 when you first came?
BP: Very primitive.
AP: All dirt roads and just wild country. No, there were
no roads, no stores, no filling stations, nothing out
there. There isn't yet, but there will be a lot more. BP: We had a man that came out once a week and delivered some fresh produce, milk and ice cream. Rye Thompson did this. During the winter months when there was lots of snow, we would all meet at a trailer house up here. Some people would--she was living in town, here in town, and [we'd] all go out in a caravan so if one person was having troubles there would be the others
that would help him.
AP: And we had troubles.
SS: Tell me about some of those troubles.
5

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C. PRITCHARD #1
AP: We had mud and snow. I had a jeep pickup and they
said, "Well, you'd better break trail," and that's always the story, so I had to go first and break trail for everybody to go through, and it was rough. Lots of mud, lots of snow and no roads.
SS: When the AEC was ready to do exploration in the area, I suppose they had to make a ~oad into wherever they were going to.
AP: Yes, that's why we had, I believe we had six caterpillars out at Fry Canyon. They had to make all the roads into their drill sites wherever they were drilling, whatever area.
ss: Well, I take it then that they maintained a year- round operation up there.
AP: Yes, they would work ten days and then they would have four days off, and I don't think anything stopped them, rain, snow or anything else. It never did seem to bother anybody. They always went right ahead and worked.
BP: Except flash floods.
AP: Went ahead and worked. Wel1, it was on one side or
the other of it and that's all they could do--which
way you were going.
SS: How many people were in the AEC camps out at Fry, do
you recall?
6

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C . PRITCHARD # 1
AP: No, there were 30 trailers.
BP: Well, those were the government trailers, weren't
AP:
BP:
they, honey? Then there was the mineral--no it wasn't the mineral engineers that did the drilling, was it? They had their camp right next to ours. I expect all together we must have had at least 45 trailers, don't you?
I don't know how many people there were, but would say probably a hundred.
I expect close to it counting all the children and everybody. Jim Richardson was head engineer, chief engineer in that camp and Bob Sweeten was the chief geologist. He, Andy Anderson who was over here from Africa, he was raised in Africa, was more or less over the whole operation you know, but--
When you were at Fry, did many people have their families there in your camp?
Well, yes. Several people had their families that
were younger children, children that were not in school, but kids in school had to have someplace else to stay. The older people didn't bring their kids out until summertime.
ss:
AP:
SS: Well, now you say that this is at Fry Canyon, is this more or less where the AEC buying station was?
AP: No, that was at the Happy Jack.
7

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C . PRITCHARD # 1
SS: Uh huh. This was where the store is now.
AP: It's on up the wash north.
BP: Camp was on the other side. It was on this side of
Fry Canyon.
AP: It's where the copper mill is now, across the wash
from the copper m ill.
SS: Oh, uh huh. Did you go up there?
AP: Yes. Well, you saw that, they've got an old cowboy
shack that sits out there now across from the wash on that big slickrock. That's where we had a camp set up.
SS: And what would you do about getting water?
AP: We dug us a sump in the washá there, boxed it all in and pumped water up to a tank and then ran it down
from the tank to the trailers.
SS: You must have had quite a bit of generator equipment
to supply power for that many trailers.
AP: We had a big GMC generator and we also had a stand-by
unit.
SS: Well, in doing maintenance work in such an isolated
area, was it difficult to be able to have parts that
you needed and this sort of thing?
AP: Uh, when I went to work for the outfit, they told me
to figure far enough ahead to have stuff on hand to where I could fix anything that came along, but I
8

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C. PRITCHARD #1 couldn't do it .
BP: What was it, our supply trucks came up once or twice a week?
AP: Once, I think.
BP: He would radio into Grand Junction and then they
would send out the supplies that we needed and he-- he's pretty good at improvising though and making some of his own things that--you know. In fact, he got a letter from a kid from Australia that went to the compound in Grand Junction, and on the envelope it says, in a big box, "To the best damn mechanic in the AEC." (laugh) Clear from A ustralia.
AP: We should have that letter.
BP: I've got it someplace. I don't know where it is right
now. I said I'd never get rid of it.
AP: No,itwasalotoffun.Wehadalotofextrahours
to work, but still it was a lot of fun.
SS: Were the people that were actually doing the drilling and the work in the field, were they in demand
because of the things that they might talk about out
there?
BP: We had several visitors in the camp. I don't think
anybody though, of course--I think the geologists were the only ones that had any information. I think they were probably sworn into where they couldn't
9

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C. PRITCHARD #1 talk, you know, too freely.
AP:
No, the drilling, you never knew whether they hit any ore or not. Nobody ever told anything, and I personally didn't care because that wasn't my line of work and I never cared anything about having a uranium mine of my own. Lots of people did, but I didn't.
Did you ever do any prospecting or staking on your own?
One time three of us: Willy Sertonio and myself and another fellow from Florida, staked four claims. Willy had a caterpillar and the other fellow had a drill rig and I had myself, and we went out and staked the claims and drilled then and nothing. We forgot all about it. It wasn't too expensive for us
because they had the equipment.
Wel1, now down at Fry, besides the AEC camp there, were some other pretty good-sized camps around, weren't there? Well, maybe--it's hard for me to keep the timing straight. Just exactly what mines were flourishing at what time? Maybe I could just ask you.
What mines were in production at the time that you
SS:
AP:
SS:
were down there?
AP: Let's see. The Radium King and the Bull's Eye and the
Spook and the Happy Jack. 10

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C. PRITCHARD #1
BP:
AP: BP: AP:
SS: BP:
AP:
But there was one up, that you had to go around up on that point, wasn't there?
Yeah, but I don't know what they called it.
I can't remember who the--
It's up on the hill from where John and Elmer are. It belonged to Warren Bronson and Ace Holton.
W ell, there are some mines.
Well, the Hideout was working at that time when you were up there, because didn't you go up on Deer Flat and work up there.
The Hideout was in operation too. Bob Hancock has been in operation up there for 20 years now--Even/Odd or what they call it. I think that's what they call it. Our kids have climbed out the windows and torn the screens out until we have to keep all the doors and windows closed.
So, there were quite a number of mines that were going with the camps when you were up there.
Yes, but nothing real close to our camps.
I guess, but the Spook went right up--that was about the closest one.
SS:
AP: BP:
SS: What did you do for entertainment out there in the middle of nowhere?
BP: Oh, we had picnics. We went down to Natural Bridges, and there was a big hollowed out place in the rock
11

 MR.
AP: BP:
SS:
BP:
SS:
AND MRS. ALFRED C . PRITCHARD # 1
and the kids would go swimming. We went--we'd go with Alfred quite a little bit. He'd go on Elk Ridge and we'd go up and visit the families up there.
Had a lot of slide shows and spaghetti suppers. Somebody would say, "What are you having for supper?" and "I'm having so and so." We'd pool it and just have dinner together. I remember somebody would play the guitar and we'd all have sing-alongs.
It sounds like everybody got along together quite well.
They were quite congenial. Now in White Canyon camp, I think that the geologists were a little more clanny than most of the camp, but it was such a big camp that this could have been the reason also.
What about the little community down at the river, White Canyon? Did you ever get down there?
AP: Yes, we were down there quite a lot. We bought groceries down there.
BP: We usually went down once or twice during the two week period from Elk because we did have the three children--we didn't have these two little ones, but our first ones.
SS: And what was that like down there?
AP: It was 3O miles of the roughest roads you've ever
seen in your life. It was on the river. They had a 12

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C. PRITCHARD #1
mill when we first started down there, and it's underwater now.
They had a ferry where you could go across if you
BP:
SS:
BP: AP:
BP: AP: BP:
ss:
BP:
AP: BP:
needed to go up to Green River that way.
How was that road across the river? Was it more of the same?
We crossed one more, 61 times, we counted.
North Wash out of the river out to Hanksville used to have to cross that wash about 60 times.
61 times.
It was rough. This place was rough in the wintertime. I think that's the happiest time I ever had--made wonderful friendships. Everybody--if you were out of something, you'd go borrow from somebody. They were just marvelous people.
Were most of the people in the area--I'm sure that most of the people in the AEC camp were not from what you might call from this local area, or were they?
No, I don't think any of them were. I think we had two families.
No, they were from--
I think we had two families at Fry Canyon, weren't there two families at Fry Canyon? Milt Nielsen from
Monticello and Melicia Tonia from here are all I can think of offhand that were local. The rest of them
13

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C. PRITCHARD #1
were from Colorado, or of course, a lot of them came
from the universities out there. This would be their
first job, you know. SS: Y eah.
BP: Now when we were over at Cove school, John Aster was working for his master's degree. He ate, slept, drank, everything geology. That was it. He was so
intelligent that he was paid a hundred dollars retainer by an oil company so that if he ever quit the AEC he would go with the oil company. They would go hunting, he and his wife, and he would dig geology and she would go hunting. They'd go fishing and she'd fish and he would do geology.
SS: Were many of the miners that were there what you might call transient, that would be there one--you know, for a couple of days and gone again?
AP: Not in the AEC. The people who were in the AEC were pretty well established. They were government workers. In the mining after I got out of the AEC and went to work for Colorado Oil and Gas, there were a lot of what they called tramp miners that came in and
they were there only long enough to get a grub stake
you might say, and shove off.
SS: Well, did you work for COG Minerals out there?
AP: Yes, I worked at the Spook Mine for COG Minerals for 14

 MR.
BP:
AP: BP:
SS: AP:
AND MRS. ALFRED C . PRITCHARD # 1
how long, Betty, do you remember?
You sent to work there in January, and when did you go to work for Merwin out here at the Payday?
I can't tell you.
It was just a matter of six months or so, and then he went to work in a shop here and he was a mechanic for Merwin Shumway. He eventually, leased that shop and he went into business for himself up here.
When you were working in the Spook, did you mine?
No, I was doing mechanics. I was down in the mine a lot, repairing equipment down there. They'd run the track off the loader or tear a rear end down from under a shuttle car or something. I had to be down in the mine quite a bit, but I didn't like it. Not when you have to work in grease and sand next together. It doesn't work too good.
Well, you were working for Merwin Shumway at the Payday Mine?
No, at the Payday Repair Shop.
Oh, at the Payday Repair Shop.
Everything they had was the Payday because this is what their big mine was. The Payday Drugstore was theirs.
SS:
AP: SS: BP:
SS: Oh, I see.
BP: The Payday Repair Shop, and they got rid of all their
15

 MR.
SS:
AP:
SS:
AND MRS. ALFRED C . PRITCHARD # 1
holdings now.
It sounds 1ike a pretty 1ucky name to stay with, doesn't it?
I'd like to have it.
Let's see, we were talking about the little community down at White Canyon. It kind of seemed to me like before I started this project or really got into it, that that little community down there at White Canyon was just about near to anything there was in this whole area. Really just a uranium boom town. Would you think it could be called that?
Well, it was a place to live and to buy groceries and that thing, and it wasn't--
They eventually had a church and a school and they tried to start another little store, you know, on the--the fellow that tried in his trailer house on up the road, you know, near the Happy Jack. Woody Edgell, but it never did materialize, so I just called it a community. I wouldn't call it a boom town.
I think you have to give Myer Brisa lot of credit to
stay on the place 1ike that. I think he did a big service to the community, to the country in having that service there.
AP:
BP:
AP:
SS: I understand that he really carried a lot of people 16

 MR.
AP: SS: AP:
SS:
AP:
BP: ss:
AP: ss:
AP:
AND MRS. ALFRED C . PRITCHARD #1
on credit.
He did, he did.
Was that kind of the general rule that he did?
This town was founded on credit, I believe, and it's run that way ever since.
Well, how about the people that were working for the AEC, did you get a pretty good wage with them?
I eventually made $3.10 an hour, which was considered a pretty good wage twenty years ago.
I wish you were making that much now.
Well, did the AEC make a point of paying a little better than average wages?
Yes.
In order to--because of the nature, the secret nature of their work?
I didn't work directly for the AEC. I worked for a contractor. Walker Linebarger Construction company. We had to have a clearance, government clearance. I think mine was HEW clearance. THey checked you all out to see if you were lying or what you were. Everything was hush hush.
Well, was there a real air of secrecy around the AEC camp or was everybody just pretty busy and paid no attention to it?
SS:
BP: I really don't think people were worried about it. 17

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C. PRITCHARD #1
They never thought about it and didn't talk about it- -do you?
AP: Not too much. Yeah, if you'd ask somebody something, "Why did you hit ore in this hole," or something like that that's about as far as you got with it.
ss: Well, folks have been telling me about some of the parties you used to have out there. Did you all get in on any of those?
AP: We had a few. We had pretty good times. We went to dances in the office and drank a few beers and had a good time. But we have them even yet.
SS: Oh, when you moved from Fry Canyon, did you move, the whole camp, I mean, did AEC suspend operations there or--?
AP: No, we moved from there; the AEC camp was still there and I would go back out there and do their--I would contract out of Cottonwood all over the area then. This is the reason they moved him so that he would be
more centrally located because he had such a large area to cover. They built him a shop on a power wagon that had all kinds of equipment and a bin for bolts. Then he went to Monument Valley and he was doing Big Indian, Fry Canyon, I don't know what all--Elk Ridge. Seems like there was another camp he was in there to
at that time--I can't remember. 18
BP:

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C . PRITCHARD # 1
SS: Was the AEC doing exploratory work in all of those
BP: SS: AP: SS:
BP: AP: SS: BP:
AP: BP:
AP:
SS:
AP:
areas?
Yes.
More or less at the same time or--?
Y es.
Well, how many exploratory teams did they have, do you recall?
I have no idea.
No, I don't know.
Approximately, say 20 or so?
I don't know whether they ever had that many camps, did they?
I don't think so.
I'd say probably ten at one time would probably be the most.
Yeah, I would imagine about ten different areas they would be working in at one time.
Can you describe to me how they would proceed in the exploratory work? I really don't have much of an idea. And how many on the crew and just what they were doing?
Geologists would go out and I don't know how, but they would see formations and decide where they
wanted to drill, and then they would go to the engineers and have them drill holes. The geologists
19

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C . PRITCHARD # 1
would flag their roads for them and the engineers would be building the roads and the drill sites, I believe, contract a company to set up the holes and then geologists would have to be there when they finished a hole and read all the samples and all that sort of thing so that they could be sure they got bottom. Then if they hit anything they'd offset a hole close by and if they didn't they'd move on out.
BP: They had surveyors too, I presume that this was for mapping where they had drilled.
AP: Yes, and they provided maps and they would spot each hole they wanted drilled on the map. They had different colored nails that they put in for ore holes and--
SS: Then they would release this information to the public periodically?
AP: The camps themselves I don't think ever had any--ever released anything, they took all they compiled to Grand Junction and it was released to the public as they wanted to release it.
SS: And you said, I think you meant that the actual drilling was contracted out to local companies.
AP: Yes, Minerals Engineering was drilling in Fry Canyon for the AEC.
BP: They also did the drilling at Cove Mesa, didn't they?
20

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C. PRITCHARD #1
AP: Mott and let's see--I don't know who it was. Any
number of drill contracts over the whole country.
SS: Well, how many, I guess they maintained their own
AP:
SS:
AP: SS: BP:
equipment then?
Yes, they got their mechanics t hat came and rode and travelled the same that I did among drilling operations.
Well, getting around the whole area like that, did you often get stranded?
No, I got tired. (laugh)
W ell, I can imagine.
It's real funny. When the kids knew Daddy was coming home, we would watch, you know, and we would stay at Cottonwood camp. One night somebody was new in camp and they said, "What's that noise?" I looked out and said, "That's all right. Al's coming home and the kids always act like that when he comes home."
I had to tie the motor in with the chain a few times to make it home, but I got there.
AP:
ss: Well, we were talking about flashfloods earlier. Did you have any close calls with getting washed away in some of these places?
BP: He didn't. I did.
SS: You did?
BP: He was gone one day and we had a flash flood. We were
21

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C . PRITCHARD # 1
parked right on the edge of White Canyon and the flash flood came down and it was beginning to wash up under the trailers, you know. Well, we couldn't get out because the road was across the wash. So all of the women--there were just one or two men. They even pulled a trailer or two out and all the women took their children and water and food and clothes. We all went to the office to wait until we'd get some help,
the water would go down. There was--I never did find out where it was, but there was one camp that was in worse shape than we were. The woman said, "The water's coming up and we're leaving," and they all thought it was me from Fry Canyon. It wasn't. I didn't even know how to work the radio.
AP: One time out here at Cottonwood, I parked my power wagon on this side of the wash and left, went somewhere--I don't know where I went, but when I came back that wash had been clear out where my power wagon was. Somebody had moved the wagon out and I didn't lose it.
BP: That's one of the worst flash floods we ever had. They said there was a trailer house--now this was out here at Cottonwood--and they said there was a trailer house going down just like it was a boat. The water was this deep and there were dead cattle and there
22

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C. PRITCHARD #1
were lots of--there was a pickup or two and big trees, and they went on down to the San Juan River.
SS: Well, when you were up there, when you had to go up on--well, let me ask this--out in White Canyon and Red Canyon, did they get snow out there in wintertime?
AP: Yeah, quite a bit. Yeah, they had quite a bit of snow. I've got some pictures of snow down in Monument V alley, which is quite an odd thing. Sometimes though, here a few years ago, they áhad more snow in Monument Valley than we did here and they had, what, 12 feet of snow down at somewhere in Arizona.
BP: Yeah, Flagstaff.
AP: And we had four feet at one time. All the Indians
were stranded down in the country and all their sheep
were starving to death.
BP: They had airlifts. This is unusual weather for us.
AP: They had the state, all the state equipment out
around here--snowcats and everything delivering stuff to the Indians down there, but snow was spotted. I mean from year to year it's not so--I don't know where it's going to snow down there or up here.
SS: Did, in your getting around I can imagine that you, well, you broke a lot of trails. Did you ever find people in bad shape for food or medical help or
23

 MR.
AP:
AND MRS. ALFRED C . PRITCHARD # 1
anything of this nature?
Not for food, but repair. I find them in bad shape all along the road. One night I was going from Blanding to Monticello when we lived over there and over here on Recapture [Wash] I came over the hill and met three girls in a car. They had turned the car over and were cut up pretty bad. I got my sleeping bag out and got one of them on it and pillows and stuff that I had. I got the rest of them and called the doctor. None of them were killed or anything, but pretty well cut up. That's the only wreckage I've run into.
Uh.
But somebody was always needing a battery charged or you know, you always have this type of thing when you're driving very much.
I was wondering about trying to haul ore out of some of these more inaccessible places. I don't know how in the world they got out with some of these trucks. Did the boys have many accidents and lose much equipment?
SS: BP:
SS:
AP: Quite a bit. Their trucks are scattered all over the hillsides even yet. I don't know if you went up to Preston by Fry Canyon there; there's one on the inside of the humpback up there, a pickup and an old
24

 AND MRS. ALFRED C . PRITCHARD # 1
truck. Down by the Happy Jack, George Eddy's water truck is off over the hill down there.
Hal Bradford lost one out here.
Y eah.
I saw the CAT laying down there looking like a toy down Cove.
The first time my mother saw Cove she said, "Golly, what a gully." You could tell she was from Missouri.
(laugh)
Well, did--were there many fatalities with those wrecks or did drivers manage to get off?
Most of them did.
I can't recall any fatalities. Usually a driver has enough knowhow to jump or something.
Up here at the foot of Peter's Hill there was quite a sharp--came to, collided with something and killed Rusty Musselman. W asn't i t Rusty?
Really not very long ago.
Oh, it's been several years ago, but he was loaded with ore.
You don't mean hit the back end of that pickup?
No, two trucks.
I do remember that too, but I can't remember--
AP: There have been several people killed in--died in 25

mines and falling in shafts. One fellow fell in a shaft over here not too long ago at Big Indian. We've got some deep mines over there, shafts.
SS: Out in that White Canyon area they don't seem to need to put shafts in.
AP: They run a drift there.
SS: Maybe the incline is not enough to--at least the
mines that I've been in.
AP: I don't think there are any shaft mines around here
at all.
SS: Well, I was talking to Kenneth Bailey up in
Monticello and he was telling me a little bit about this different type of mining equipment that's been used through the years. I imagine you've prepared your share of it after you left AEC or did you not ever get into mines?
AP: I did a shot at COG for quite a bit, loaders and EIMCO muckers and shuttle cars and everything you used in mines I worked on out there.
ss: Now he told me in some instances that the mining equipment would be--well, especially in Cottonwood in this area, that they would build whatever they needed according to specifications of the particular mine.
Mow what kind of problems did that give you in maintaining the equipment? Did the lack of

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C. PRITCHARD #1
standardization, in other words, make it difficult for you to maintain [them]?
AP: No, the first shuttle cars they built were built by Young Machine, I believe in Monticello. They started out with anything they could grab to put a machine together and they didn't have any prints of it, they didn't know what they had in it. It was hard to get parts for it, but we could usually go and they knew what machine we were working on and they could supply parts for it. The loaders were mostly International, and that simplified matters quite a bit in parts. But that's the only lack of standardization I think they had was when they first began. They have now standard machines and they know exactly what they have in it. Their loaders are German and their chassis is all fabricated here and they ship them all over the world from Monticello. Most of our AEC equipment was standard Jeeps, GMC and Chevrolet. So we didn't have too much trouble with that.
ss: I imagine that it was pretty difficult to keep things held together up there.
AP: It was.
SS: Did the rough country just pound things to death or--
?
AP: Yeah, nobody cared much. One geologist came in one

time and he said, "I wish you'd look at my Jeep," he said, "because it's got a healthy whine." (laugh)
SS: Well, maybe you can tell me this: do you tune equipment regularly for these altitudes? I don't know what--8,000 feet or say 6,000 to 9,000, something differently than they would be tuned for Oto 90?
AP: Oh yes. Recommended degree of advance on spark timing where you put maybe a 1,000 feet of altitude from sea level, so it's recommended at 8 degrees sea level by the book which all books are set up that way, then it would add another seven degrees for here because of lighter air, less humidity.
SS: I think that's what's the matter with my car.
BP: You're from California? Yeah.
AP: A little tired.
BP: Our son comes out here, he's from San Diego and he
came out from Hawaii and his car just---?---. He has
a '69 Camino. He bought it in Hawaii.
SS: Yeah, sometimes they get stuck that last few feet up
top the hill. They just kind of don't go.
AP: Yeah, they get awful lazy when they get up here. They tend to overheat. It's about the worst country in the world for heating problems I believe, because of the
altitude and the dryness.
BP: Have you ever seen any of the pictures of any of the
28

 MR. AND MRS. ALFRED C . PRITCHARD # 1 camps or anything?
SS: I sure haven't.
BP: Well, possibly you might get some idea. Now most of
these, in order to get your pictures of full camp, you're up real high or something. There's also one-- that road is terrific. You really can't believe the roads that they had to go on.
SS: Well, maybe we could stop this recording then for a while and look at those pictures. I might have some more questions after that.
