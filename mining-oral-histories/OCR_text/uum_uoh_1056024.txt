 THE FOLLOWING IS AN INTERVIEW WITH ROBERT BLANC, CONDUCTED BY LINDA WEST AT COSTA MESA, CALIFORNIA IN AUGUST, 19 7 0
(?) е
LW: Mr. Blanc, to start with, would you like to tell us something about yourself? How you got started in the uranium industry?
RB: All right. I think it .might be good for the record to know just a bit of my background, since it should be important, I think, in the case of anyone being
interviewed. You' re going to get a particular perspective, I suspect, depending on the person's background. First of all, I am the minerals exploration manager for the Getty Oil Company headquartered in Los Angeles. I am a geologist by profession and have been in the mining and minerals exploration business for about fifteen, eighteen years. Getty Oil Company is a major integrated oil company, international oil company involved in exploration, production, and marketing worldwide and have been in mining for about fifteen years. The J. Paul Getty interests, family interests that control the company, and for many years the principal operating company was Tidewater Oil. Tidewater was merged into Getty in November, I believe, of 1 68. The mining and minerals activity of the company was
originally conducted by Tidewater Oil. In about 1955--'54, '55, during the initial uranium boom, the

 ROBERT BLANC #1
Tidewater management, Mr. Getty, made the decision to explore for uranium. They organized a small group made up of some new people that were brought in at the time as well as some oil experts and geologists
from the company. And they established an office in Albuquerque, I think, in 1955, which incidentally was some years before I joined the company. Conducted exploration from the period '55 through, oh, '59, about--'58, '59. The greatest effort was expended in New MExico in the Grants-Ambrosia district, in that general region--actually in an area which lies just a little west of what's now the Ambrosia Lake property. But in addition they did work in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming. And in 1957, the discovery was made in the Shirley Basin which led subsequently to what is now the Petrotonics Mine and Mill which is operated by our company for a partnership between Kerr-McGee and Skelley Oil Company. I can give you some idea of what I understand the history of the discovery to be, but I think I should qualify it since I was not involved
at that time, and these things should be verified. And I've heard a number of stories myself, as you can imagine. And unfortunately, this is one of the things about discoveries is that very often, at least, the true details of the discovery are often lost. From
с2

 ROBERT BLANC #1
what I piece together from things I have been told, a company by the name now of Teton Drilling of Casper, Wyoming which is run by a chap by the name of Dave Lisko was prospecting in the Shirley Basin. He had a small drilling company at the time and he came up with some uranium indications. I don't know how good the shows were, but I think he actually started
staking some ground. His staking, drilling activities were actually spotted from the air by another company, and whether сthis was initially spotted by someone from our company, but in any case it got to our company right away. Our people and a chap by the name of Larry Wertz, who is now a geologist with Kerr-McGee, was at that time in charge of Tidewater's exploration in other areas and moved very quickly, in
fact, on a weekend and started a staking operation and was able to stake with a crew a large number of claims. And, as I say, that stake now covers a large part of what is the mine, the Petrotonics Mine in the Shirley Basin. We can talk more about this later. In addition, on two other sections of ground, Sections Four and Thirty-three, as they're known, was found what is today one of the largest undeveloped uranium ore bodies left in Wyoming. We have never developed this yet. It will probably come into production
3

 ROBERT BLANC #1
sometime later in the Seventies. It was a good discovery. It got the mining company into the mining business actively for the first time, and from that point the company's mining activities in uranium as well as other commodities has continued. We might just carry on the Petrotonics thing for a minute. Skelley Oil Company of Tulsa, Oklahoma is a sister company of Getty. Getty Oil controls better than 50 percent of Skelley today. I don't know what the ownership was at that time. But from the very
beginning Skelley Oil has been a partner of ours in all of our uranium ventures. It's no secret. They participate on a one-third basis; that is, everything we do in uranium that Getty initially Tidewater, now Getty does in uranium, Skelley participates at one- third Skelley, two-thirds Getty. That's their share of the ownership of all the reserves in the Shirley Basin. And they are a partner of our both in the mine and in the undeveloped reserves. The mine there was started in about 1957--'57 or '58, and came on production about '58, '59, five hundred tons a day open-pit mine and mill. It has in recent years--in fact about two years ago it was expanded to a thousand tons per day, and then just this past year, it's increased to fifteen hundred tons a day. Now the
4

 ROBERT BLANC # 1
early history of Petrotomics beyond this--there's a lot of detail and good history that you ought to get on this. A chap within our organization by the name of Norm Grant was involved at that time, or came very shortly after the mine started and knows that history and knows it well. Unfortunately, he's out of the country right now, but he'11 be back soon, and I would suggest if you continue this program and if you're around, that you really ought to get together with Norm and talk about it.
Yeah, he sounds like the man to talk to.
Yeah, Norm's a mine engineer and was in charge of the mine and mill for sometime. So he not only is knowledgeable in that period of history of the
industry, but was also very active in Canada in uranium in the early days. In fact, that's how he happened to come to our organization. So beyond that, which is really just a sort of thumbnail sketch of how the company got into mining and uranium and how we got started in the Shirley Basin, I think it would probably be inappropriate for me to say any more
because I'm just not that knowledgeable about the details. Incidentally, I brought home some papers today. I assume Gary is aware of these, but they're published once a year in Riverton, Wyoming. A special
LW: RB:
5

  ROBERT BLANC #1
issue comes out on, oh, sort of--it's the annual mining issue. This is our operation at Petrotonics. This was a new shovel which is one of the biggest shovels in operation in uranium. And there are hundred-ton trucks, which are also some of the largest. See the size of the guys? We just put this in. The point being that these papers--each year this is an annual issue and it sort of recaps things, the status of the industry, and in addition covers a lot
of history. And I have kept the last three years, so
you'll find a lot of Wyoming history in this.
LW: Oh, that's what we need.
RB: All right. I .don't know again whether Gary knows this
chap, Peck. They're two brothers in Riverton, and I always forget which one is which. But one is really the Wyoming historian. Well, I forget. But I'm sure it's in here. And if Gary is really pursuing the uranium industry and history in Wyoming, he should certainly be in touch with Peck, if he's not already. He may well be already. But he is certainly the unofficial historian. So, again, I think that's probably all I ought to say about that phase of the history. And then maybe sort of then skip onto the second go-round. What happened when it appeared that we had all the uranium that was needed, and this was
6

 ROBERT BLANC # 1
actually a statement, you know, by the commissioner of the A.E.C. that we had all of the uranium that we could possibly need. We got out of the business of exploration. The Atomic Energy Commission would not
issue the authority required for additional milling. In other words, they would not buy anymore. They would not issue any more contracts for the acquisition of yellow cake. So people just plum got out of the exploration business for uranium. Or almost everybody did. And this happened in the--oh, about the end of the Fifties and early Sixties. The principal exception to this is Kerr-McGee. Oh, Kerr-
McGee cut back in their expenditures and their effort, but they maintained at least a small program in uranium exploration almost continuously. Now if you get down to actually data, they may have quit for a year or two. I don't know. But it's generally recognized that they really stayed with it, even on a small scale. And it has paid off rather well. Tidewater, the Getty exploration company at that time, disbanded their group. Some of the people left and went elsewhere and others went back to oil and gas exploration. Nothing more was done about uranium exploration until about 1965 when there was some stirring in the industry that maybe they should be
7

 ROBERT BLANC #1
looking again. Management began to give some serious thought to this. Well, unfortunately during this same interim period, they had not really built a minerals exploration group. The mining network outside of uranium and outside of diamond exploration and mining in southwest Africa had been reduced to almost to nothingI SO they recognized a need and a desire to get into the mining business in a bigger way and a need to get back into uranium. And after considerable effort they went out and hired Sigfried Muzich, who at the time was chief geologist for the U.S. Borax Company in Los Angeles. Sig Muzich came to Tidewater in April, 1966 and started a new effort in minerals exploration, and in particular, uranium. I joined the organization a couple of months later, actually in August of 1966. Sig and I have known each other for
many years and he asked me to join. Previous to that I had been in charge of small minerals exploration for Richfield Oil. It was actually several months, on into early 1967 before we got enough things going, laid out plans for uranium exploration and hired a man by the name of Paul Rodell to manage our uranium exploration program directly, set up an office in Salt Lake hiring people and getting a program underway. So it was mid-'67, really late '67 before
8

 ROBERT BLANC # 1
we were really back in it and going again. In fact,
it was on into 1968 before we really had a staff to do much. So in the second go-round, which really probably started in '65, when people, the smart ones, started getting back. And it took us unfortunately a couple of years to get going. This, incidentally, is one of the characteristics of exploration. Some people think you can turn it off and one like a faucet, but you just can't. It takes time to hire people and establish plans and programs and start a
land concept, first of all, of land prospects, and two years is really not a large amount of time at all. Since 1967 we have been conducting one of the largest domestic uranium exploration programs in the business. One of the largest. I can comment something on the number of companies and sizes, but I suspect they're probably averaged over the last three years. There are probably five or six companies at the most which have spent any more money on it than we have, had any larger program. We are continuing today and they are presently projecting a continued very aggressive program for a number of years to come in the states. Since last year we've been working on establishing a program in Canada for uranium exploration. In fact, we have an effort underway
9

 ROBERT BLANC #1
there now and are currently getting ready to increase that and start looking at uranium possibilities in other parts of the world, primarily in parts of Australia and Africa.
LW: When you said the time the A.E.C. decided that they needed no more uranium and your company phased it out, did they sell their holding in the basin or did they just shut down the operations?
RB: No. With the Shirley Basin of Wyoming--you know, that in Wyoming the first major producing district, the really large prominent one was the Gas Hills District, or Utah's Lucky Mack Mine and others. The Shirley Basin which lies to the east of the Gas Hills some thirty, forty miles, fifty miles is the site of Petrotonics Mine and a mine owned by Utah
Construction. Our mine has operated continuously ever since it started; the mine has never been shut down. There are some details about the contracts, the sales of yellow cake to the A.E.C. during that period that are an important part of the history. And again, I shouldn't comment on this because I'm just not that familiar with it. But this is what was called the Stretch out Program. The A. E. c. asked companies to reduce the amount they were currently contracted to
deliver to the A.E.C. annually. For example, if you 10

 ROB ERT BLANC # 1
were delivering a mi ll i on pounds a year, they would propose that you reduce that to five hundred thousand pounds per year, but extend the l ife of your
contract. So you actually produced more and sol more to the A.E.C. in the long run, but you did so at a slower rate. A number of companies, in fact, most companies elected to do that; ours did not. Ours was one of the two or three, I think, that did not. So our last sales, our last shipment to the A.E.C. was made about 1965 or so. Again, that may not be the exact date. Since that time we've made one large private sale and are currently producing and simply storing in warehouses all of our products. This is
not a very profitable operation. In fact, you see, we have no income at this time from our uranium production. The price is depressed now, really not much more than what it costs us to produce right now, and this is a whole subject in itself. Some phase of this study really ought to be dedicated to just the history of the market and the price. See, the A.E.C. guaranteed a price; so many dollars--$8.00 a pound was the average. The private market has picked up down as low in the $5.00 range. They may have even been a cent or two lower. It's currently selling for $6.50, $7.00 to $7.25 a pound, so the price has not
11

 ROBERT BLANC # 1
even come back yet to where it was with the A. E. C. price. What it's going to do in the future is going to be very, very critical to the industry. We could talk about that all night. And there are all kinds of projections as to what's going to happen to the price. It's certainly my opinion that it's going to go up. It's going to have to go up to pay for the exploration that it's going to take to find the amount of uranium that we're going to need. Anyway, I think we might have gotten off the track a bit. In the Shirley Basin, anyway, the Petrotonics Mine which is owned by Getty Oil, Skelley Oil, and Kerr-McGee,
has operated continuously ever since it started up in, say, 1957 or '58. We have also, as I think I mentioned earlier, these undeveloped reserves there that are owned by Getty and Skelley; Kerr-Mcgee has no interest. These will be developed when the price is on the rise, sometime probably in the late '70s,
we think.
LW: Where else do you have different holdings besides in
Wyoming? I think you mentioned Ambrosia Lake?
RB: In the early program, they acquired a lot of land
near Ambrosia Lake, New Mexico.
LW: New Mexico, right.
RB: New Mexico is really the major producing state. And
12

 ROBERT BLANC # 1
in New Mexico it's in the Ambrosia Lake and Grants District. Have you looked at a map? Do you know where these are?
LW: I have them in my head.
RB: Okay. Well, I think you should because it certainly
helps most people to have a visual image. In fact, sometime if Gary is ever interested, we have a good collection of kodachromes on uranium mining in Wyoming and New Mexico which shows geology and mining methods and everything. And we'd be glad to show these.
LW: I'm sure he'd be delighted! Outside of the Shirley Basin, what other holdings are you currently involved in?
RB: Rather than answering exactly that way, Linda, your exact question, let me recap by saying when the second period of exploration started, that is, the second major increase in interest in 1965, '66, people, of course, in general in the industry went
back and sort of picked up where things had been left off earlier, obviously. So they immediately went back to begin with the producing districts, and primarily those in Wyoming and New Mexico, which are by far the most important uranium producing areas. People began taking up land as close in to producing mines as they
13

 ROBERT BLANC #1
could, wherever it was available. In many cases they had plays, prospects that they had developed in the earlier go-round and they went back and picked these up again, started with these. In our own case, our files were full of reports produced in the first program, and we set to work recovering these and reviewing them. We were fortunate in getting one man who had participated in the earlier program back with our new group so that this tied the two together. But in getting _started, . aside from the principal known
producing districts, people then began looking for similar basins in Wyoming that maybe had not gotten as much attention as others--other parts of the Ambrosia-Grants d istrict, either to the west primarily, towards GAllup, towards what's called Church Rock. Over to the north and east in the Chama Basin area that you mentioned earlier--
LW: Uh huh.
RB: Chama Basin area. Do you know that? Do you know
something about Chama?
LW: I know that it was one of the fields discovered in
the second move.
RB: All right. On the basis of our assessment of the
opportunities and the kinds of mines that have been found, we concentrated our effort to begin with in
14

 ROBERT BLANC # 1
Wyoming and New Mexico, and we have continued to do very little work in Utah and Colorado. And I think that this has probably been the right decision. We
feel that there are better opportunities for discoveries and for larger ore bodies in the other states than there is in Utah and Colorado. So in Wyoming we set to work developing prospects and acquiring lands in basins, the Wind River Basin, the areas west and south of the Gas Hills. And quite early in our program, we were aware that there was a lot of activity in what's called the Powder River Basin. I would say that right now there has probably been more money spent in the Powder River Basin in northeastern Wyoming than any other single place, any other single district or basin for new exploration anywhere in Wyoming or anywhere else in the country. And further, there have been more discoveries made in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming than there has anywhere else. There's some serious question as to whether they are competitive--ore reserves, that is. Whether they could be mined profitably at the same price that some of the New Mexico reserves might be. But in any case, there has probably been as much drilling money spent, and pounds of uranium in the ground discovered in the Powder River Basin as
15

 ROBERT BLANC #1
anywhere else in the country. And again, Kerr-McGee was the first one, one of the first ones, if not the first one, back in. They had several hundred thousand acres of land there before we even started. They've done a lot of work. They had at least one major new discovery there. Others, including Humble Oil, Teton Drilling, which is the same group that made the initial discovery in the Shirley Basin in the early years, Union Pacific Railroad, Cordero, Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company--and I'11 say a lot more about them--Western Nuclear, Ohio--all of these began taking up acreage in the Powder River Basin. And you had to realize that it's a huge area to begin with. The Basin is, oh, what 50 miles wide and 150 miles long, something like this. And most of the activities and the discoveries, the drilling at that time, was at the southern end of the basin. And I should say that uranium was known in the Powder River Basin in the early days. In fact, there had been mining there, but it had all been rather small, very small, numerous small mines. No big ones at all. In 1968, in other words, really in our second year of operation,
about the end of one year of operation, we were invited by the Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company of Cleveland, Ohio to join them in exploration on this
16

 ROBERT BLANC # 1
large block of ground that they have in the Powder River Basin. over a hundred thousand acres of claims, mining claims and leases. And since that time we elected to join them and continued to work there with them. To date, over two million feet of drilling has been done by our project alone. We have some very encouraging results so far. We have not announced any new discovery, any new mines, new deposits, but we are very encouraged and are continuing our work up there. It would appear, again, as I said earlier, the Powder River is the one new district which will probably to come out of the second round. There are no mines in production and although there have been several announcements to the effect that people were going to put in mines, to date nobody has done so. It looks now 1ike Humble Oil may be the first one to
mine there. They're currently doing some mine
planning.
LW: Also in the Powder--?
RB: All in the Powder River Basin. The Wind River Basin,
we've spent a lot of money in there on the Indian reservation and found nothing. And we moved out of that. There was a big play south of what's called the Wind River Range in kind west-central Wyoming. A lot of testers, but it looks at this stage like t her e ar e
17

 ROBERT BLANC # 1
no mines, no new deposits in there. About six months ago, in about December of last year, a company called Colorado Corporation announced a new discovery in what's called the Red Desert area, up in central Wyoming. Since then there have been at least three other discoveries announced in the Red Desert area. We moved in as fast as we could following the initial announcement. We have large holdings there now and are currently drilling in that area. And I suspect that aside from the Powder River Basin, it may turn out to be the next most important new area in Wyoming. But again, these areas aren't all really new. In the first go-round, people did a lot of looking, it's just a fact that they didn't leave much uncovered. But in these basins like Powder River and Red Desert, the drilling they did failed to develop any large deposits. Well, now more detailed drilling, closer drilling, or deeper drilling in some cases or just more fortunate drilling has produced these new
discoveries. So it looks like we might have a new district shaping up there. Aside from the rather classic area of Wyoming and New Mexico, the other big play in this current, most recent go-round has been in the Gulf Coast area of Texas. There in Karnes County, north of Corpus Cristi, Susquehanna has had a
18

 ROBERT BLANC # 1
small mine in operat i on since the late fifties or early sixties; very small but very profitable mines. A number of people moved into the Gulf Coast area, and again, we were a little late. We were beh i nd some of the others. The big operators there have been Susquehanna, Humble, Atlantic-Richfield--and notice all the oil companies. Most of the oil companies have gotten into the uranium exploration business . Continental Oil, Amarillo Minerals which recently changed their name to Pioneer Nuclear, Utah Construction, and other have been active in the Gulf Coast are now for about two to three years. Conoco, Homestate, others. There have been discoveries. The figures are available from the A. E. C. as to what's been discovered in this area. You can find out who has them. I think the only comment that's pertinent here is that they have been generally small ore bodies, a million to three million pounds, which can be minable, can be profitable, but it's a small ore body. People are starting to pull out of Texas for the exploration of uranium. A lot of them have. A few are continuing to work there, optimistic that they
will find other small ones, and are satisfied with the small ones. But right now it's quite clear that the big period of uranium expenditures in Texas has
19

 ROBERT BLANC #1
passed. The belt which is a belt line inland some 150, 200 miles from the coast and more or less paralleling the Gulf coast because that's the trend of the sediments there. I would say, roughly that it has been prospected from the Mexican border of the southwest end all the way on into Louisiana on the east end. WE've done exploration ourselves pretty well along the belt, airborne radiometries in many areas, much of the belt inground work, surface work, drilling scattered along. I'm sure there will be other reserve, new deposits found in Texas, but the indication is that they will not be large, and a lot of people are getting out of Texas. We're still there ourselves. So, sort of recapping exploration to date in the states on the second go-round, the largest
discoveries, the greatest amount on a per state basis, has been in Wyoming. Again, these figures are available from the A~E.C. They publish them once a year, but Wyoming and New Mexico are running very close right now in terms of total reserves. I think exploration for the next couple of years will be most active in these two states. There has not been much added in Wyoming, in Colorado or Utah. And as I say it's a nominal addition in Texas. We've spent some effort on new concepts. We've played with some ideas,
20

 ROB ERT BLANC # 1
new types of occur r ences in Arizona. We found uranium, but not nearly enough to make a mine. One of the things that concerns me is where we are going to
find all of the uranium that's projected to be needed. We' 11 continue to find more, I'm s ure, in these known area, that is, in the classic areas, but we're going to have to start finding more totally new districts, totally new occurrences. And of course, this thing gets into an international situation. There's been--this is probably getting beyond the scope of your interest at this time. But there has been, although not the same total expenditures, but an equally aggressive program and comparable increase in activity in Canada for uranium in about this same period. The Canadian government has recently announced some major changes in their laws which is going to significantly affect foreign investment in there. Right now the industry is very much up in the air about this waiting to find out what's going to happen. That's a whole subject in itself. And someday we'll certainly be an important part of the uranium industry history. It's one of my pet beliefs, and it is certainly not an original concept, but it's one of
my pet beliefs that the uranium industry is going to be in international business. In ten years, there
21

 ROBERT BLANC # 1
will be a relatively small number of companies around the world producing most of the uranium. I think they'11 be international producers; that is, there will be American companies producing in several countries around the world; and there will be some Canadian companies producing from several countries around the world, just as an example. We're going to have to go to other places to find the uranium that we need.
LW: What about--I read about some projects of reclaiming uranium from the ocean, mining the ocean for uranium. Would that be profitable?
RB: Well, it's kind of like the way people talk about mining gold from the ocean. The figure I always carry in my mind--I don't know whether this is still a valid--is that there are twenty-two tons of gold in a cubic mile of sea water, which is a lot of gold. I forget the value of that. There's not 1ikely to be any gold mined or recovered from the sea water for many, many, many years. And the same is certainly true of uranium. This is not a foreseeable reserve.
The time may come at some great distant future, but it just isn't in the cards. Uranium is really not as rare in the earth's crust as you might think. It
exists in rocks, certain rocks in small quantities, 22

 ROBERT BLANC # 1
much lower than the ore grade that it takes to mine today, but at much higher grade than there is in sea water. The phosphate deposits of Florida which are major phosphates and the Western states contain small
amount of uranium, and these are potential long-range sources. There has been a new discovery made in southwest Africa within the past six months by Rio Tinto Zinc, R. T. Z. Company, a large English mining company, which is a new type of occurrence. It's lower grade. Whereas the average U.S. uranium mine contains about four pounds of uranium, u3o8 in a ton of ore, this deposit contains a little over a pound. So normally this might not be an economic ore body, but it's very, very large and apparently will be very low-cost mining. It's just almost digging in a different type of rock from which any uranium has been commercially produced. Well, of course, the minute this happens, all explorations begin to think that there must be more of these, see. So very likely what's going to happen is that we will be looking for other type of uranium ore bodies than the kind we now have. I don't know whether it's appropriate at this
time to try to get into the geology of uranium deposits, but those in the states are primarily one type. The Wyoming are all essentially one type. The
23

 ROBERT BLANC #1
New Mexico deposits are the large reserves in the Blind River District in Canada, for example, or the deposits of South Africa. These three areas, of course, represent about 90 percent, 95 percent of the free world's supply of uranium. And each is in a different geologic type of geologic occurrence. There is some similarity between the African and the Canadian Bline River. Well, let's see, what else
would be maybe of interest of any contribution at
all?
LW: Well, one thing struck my mind while you were
talking. You know, the first boom was like every
little man could go out-- RB: Yes.
LW: --and find his own
RB:. Yes.
LW: This new one sounds like it's only for the big
companies.
RB: Well, that's a good point. I don't know whether
you've seen much or not, but this is a very significant difference and should be brought out. You're right. During the early go-round, everybody with a geiger counter was our prospecting, and a number of discoveries were made by amateur prospectors. Several things contributed to this. With
24

 ROBERT BLANC # 1
a geiger counter a surface outcrop of uranium is easy to identify. In other words you don't need to know anything other than your counter is clicking and you've made a discovery. This and the bonus program which the government encouraged, and just the general
interest of the public. The public is very much prospect-minded, amazingly so. There's a bit of prospector in almost everybody. So this really was a significant factor. People didn't--the professional didn't really know much about the occurrence of uranium and so--[blank tape]
