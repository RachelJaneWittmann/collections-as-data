 KOSUYE OKURA JANUARY 8 , 1 9 8 9
KO Because we didn't have any other means of transportation. NT How long did it take you?

people could ride that but sometimes I used to walk and

 KOSUYE OKURA JANUARY 8, 1989
NT Did they make the sake themselves or did they have people work for them make sake
KO They just made that during the winter time
NT Your father did that?
KO: No, seven men came to make the sake They were hired
people that came
NT Just the first three months of the year
KO It was for three months, November, December, and January NT Why did they only make sake only in the winter?
KO They didn't have any temperature control then like air
conditioning, so they could only make it during the winter It would turn kind of sour if you made it in the hot season
NT That is right because you were born January 1, 1900 Was that a lucky day, do people you say you are lucky?
KO. I don't know
NT KO
NT KO NT KO
What did your mother do?
She didn't do anything She had maids come and do the work So she was a lady of leisure She had somebody to make the meals and take care of the kids

grade In those days if you have little money the maid was so cheap, like ten cents a day so they didn't do nothing, but they had an entire people to come and govern them
NT: You had somebody come and do the garden KO For ten cents a day
NT: Oh, what a deal
KO His father didn't do anything
NT. He just supervised, I guess
KO I guess our hardship carne when my mother died when I was
thirteen.
NT You were thirteen when your mother died?
KO My father died when I was fifteen
NT Your father died when you were fifteen Then who took
care of you?
KO The oldest brother He was the oldest so he had to take
care of the family, he was responsible So when they
passed away I stayed on with my brother
NT. Was your brother married then?
KO Not when my father died when I was fifteen Up until that
time the sake no business had been real prosperous but since Father and Mother died it slowly started to deteriorate a little bit
NT How old was your brother when your father died? KO He wasn' t married then

 KOSUYE
OKURA JANUARY 8 , 1 9 8 9
NT Did you still have the maids and the gardener?
KO The sake no business was on the downhill We only had the maids and only when they were making sake When those seven people were hired to make the sake, it was their
job to feed them.
NT Oh, the job of the maid
KO So the maid had to cook for all the workers and then they
had to haul it over to where they were working Then after that, after the sake making time was over they couldn't afford to have the maids anymore That is the only time that we had a maid after the business started going downhill
NT When you made the sake where did the workers stay? Did they live there near you or did they go home?
KO They would go home
NT Oh, they went home
KO In those days we were very particular about the way the
sake was made It was very important for us when they came in November that they stayed there during the duration until the sake was done They were not allowed to go home, they wouldn't even let any girls come in there Before they start they would go the church and pray. They had a well that they cleaned all out and put new water in. They had very strict ways that they had to do So the seven people that was there stayed there until
5

 KOSUYE
OKURA JANUARY 8 , 1 9 8 9
NT
the sake was finished, which was about three months. Then they would go home and then they would come back next year
So the maids basically had to feed then Did they have to eat a particular food?
They could not have cow
You mean no fish and no meat?
Anything that is on four feet they could not eat Oh, but they could eat fish?
KO
NT
KO
NT
KO Yes, sakana, sashimi They had a different place were
they would make the sake and a different place for them to sleep while they were there The place where they made the sake no girl was able to go in that area at all
NT Could you go in that area after they left?
KO After everybody left I could They had barrels and they made it from rice and kozi(?) Kozi is a form of rice
that they steam in some way, and then they let it dry They steam it and kind of let if ferment Then they mix that with that regular rice
NT Could you ever watch them? Could you look over the wall? KO No
NT No, girls couldn't do that.
KO I don't think that anybody was allowed there except the
workers, except my brother who was their boss He was the only one that was allowed to go in there They had a 100
6

 KOSUYE OKURA JANUARY 8 , 1 9 8 9
NT KO:
pound rice (or fifteen bags) that they used to do everyday. They had to wash it by hand because we had no machine We had to do everything by hand.
How many barrels of sake did they make every year?
It took about three people to make a circumference to go around that barrel
One barrel?
NT
KO Yes
NTá So they made one big barrel or did they make many
barrels?
KO Between ten and twenty of these huge barrels They had to
put step ladders on it to stir it or whatever because it
was so high
NT Then when they took the sake out of these big barrels and
put them into small ones, how did they do that? Did they just dip it out?
KOá They have a spout at the bottom
NT Then did they sell it all at once? At the end of the
three months did they sell it all?
KO. We distributed it to different stores
NT So they had a contract ahead of time?
KO Well, we have been in the business for a long time and
everybody knew about it There were certain amount of those that were regulars, but if you wanted to come and buy they would come from Hiroshima City to order it
7

 KOSUYE
OKURA JANUARY 8 , 1 9 8 9
These were primitive times so if you bought one of those barrels there would be about five, six or seven gallons Out of one of those great big barrels she would get about seven or eight of the little ones We would put that on horse drawn carriages and bring it into the city, the ten gallons
NT That must have been pretty big, did the sake that your family made have a special name like Kirin, Suntori, and all of that? Was it Sugawa sake or did it have another name?
KO Sanyo Masumni was the name of it
NT: Sanyo Masumni So like now we get Kiku Masumni sake Now
KO NT KO
NT KO
NT KO
was it Sanyo or Saiyo?
Sanyo Masumni was the name of their brand.
Do they still make that brand in Nihon?
No, they don't make it any more, it got atomic bombed in World War II. In 1920 I came to the United States World war I--
--ended in 1918
It started in 1914 and it was war between the United States and who else?
Germany and Austria-Hungary were on one side
After my father died the business went down We were still in business, but instead of making a lot they cut down to about ten barrels instead of maybe forty or fifty

OKURA JANUARY 8 , 1 9 8 9
so we didn't have any maids or anything Just my mom and my brother. We had no maid or nothing The people that made the sake, like always, came and made the sake but they had a very small business at the time In between my dad died and the business went slow We were still running a business but on a small scale Then when World War I started it began to pick up a little bit and it was getting almost big At about this time I left to come to the United States We were going full scale again During that time my brother Wataru became the mayor of the city He was well respected and well thought of and all of that I came to the United States and the business kept getting better At one time when we were quite small, we were quite wealthy in the beginning when our mom and dad were alive When the bad times came we sold a lot of our property We had a lot of property that we sold in order to keep the business going Then since business got slow and we just barely made it, but because of the world war it started getting better Then my brother Wataru bought back everything that was originally theirs, so we had a big piece of property again
NT When your father died were your sisters already married? KO Yes, they were all married
NT So you and your brother were not?
KO When our father died he (Wataru) was twenty-six and I was
9

 KOSUYE
OKURA JANUARY 8 , 1 9 8 9
fifteen In Japan it was too early for him to get married so he had to have one of his relatives co-sign for him before he could get married I already had to go, I was already engaged to Okura when I was seventeen
-they were cousins .
NT But why did you get engaged with Okura? I missed that
part
KO You see during that time we were having this hardship and
one of the Okura, who was my father's brother, borrowed some money It was some other relative and a brother witnessed it At the same time that he owed them money They didn't want me to come to America.
NT Now back up. Okura witnessed some document for your brother
KO For a loan
NT He co-signed it
KO He asked for my hand in marriage to co-sign on a loan To
witness it? That is not right They didn't want to come to the United States They don't want me to come I was promised I guess the one that witnessed it was one of her sons
NT The one that witnessed it was a matchmaker for grand- mother and Okura San.
Why did you get engaged to Okura?
NT
KO When they were having their hard times--one of the Okura-
10

 KOSUYE
OKURA JANUARY 8 , 1 9 8 9
KO Yes. So that was my dad's father He said, "I want her f or my son . " He was in America already None of them wanted me to come to America, but he said, "Since I am a witness and he had been so nice to him I don't have the heart to tell her no." So I was promised to get married to him when I was seventeen
NT And he was in America. Did you know him or had you even met him?
KO No
NT How did you feel about going to America when they told
you that you have just been promised?
KO They said that he had to come after me or they wouldn't
let me go. In those times if you wanted to go bad enough I could have came by myself, but they said that he had to come after me or they wouldn't give me to him
NT Now wait a minute, when you were seventeen your brother said that we have just made this deal?
KO Other suitors couldn't come and ask for my hand or anything because I had already been promised I was promised to him, they had already put me under the Okura name before we were even married.
NT How did you feel about that when they did that?
KO In those days the parents had a lot of authority, so whatever you felt didn ' t matter, you didn't have a
choice

Did you cry?
I cried a lot My sisters didn't want me to come to
America I more or less sacrificed my life to save the fate of the family so that they wouldn't show any shame or anything. Just to save their face The parents just made up their mind
Was there any way that you thought that you could get out of it?
I don't think so because when I was promised they had already changed my name and everything
These Okuras drive a hard bargain don't they? (laughter)
NT
KOá They sure do And they were cousins to begin with. Just
one of them keeps the family name unless they can go to another family which just has all girls and they have nobody to carry on their name Well, they can go to this other person's house and carry on their name for them So actually it was Sugawas that came to Yoshi to ---?--- because they didn't have any males to Okura, so actually they were all Sugawas I married into one of the fami- lies. Like if it was in our case, since Mama only has three girls, they can marry me as a Yoshi, they would carry on my name So he didn't have as much authority as I did because I was the head of this house and he just came from this other place over here So he was kind of like "hen pecked" or he had no power
12

So in some ways then he is getting even with you right? (laughter) He gets this Okura
Okura's mom was real bossy Papa no mama deshoo? She was bossy and he didn't have much authority All the other people didn ' t want me to go to America so they were kind of having a bad time about giving their precious daughter to this family so that she would have to go to America So there was a lot of conflict there between the two families that way That is why most of the people hate to go to Yoshi Really and truly what should have happened is in Dad's case, we got three girls and Fred should have come to Yoshi and carry on the Okura name But everybody didn't like that because of the experience that I knew what had happened I didn't want to do that and so I never did ask, except to change the Taniguchi into Okura So he could have came in as Yoshi and be an Okura instead of a Taniguchi you see
Did your father's father want his son in America to get him away from the bossy mom and want you to get away You might of had a miserable life if your mother-in-law had been really bossy How did your father-in-law feel about having your dad in America? Did he think that it was a good idea or a bad idea?
It was a fad for anybody who was young to go to America My relatives or my friends around there were always

sending a lot of money from America They thought that the United States was the land of plenty So he wanted to come and he went on his own Then his brother Tsumoru(?) came later on too He was thirteen years older than I was I was only four so I really didn't know him
He was thirteen years older than you are and he had been
in America since you were four?
KO Yes , apparently my dad, Masaki, and his brother, Tsumoru,
came together They sent a lot of money back to Japan There was a local newspaper there with an article about the two brothers that worked so hard in America They had sent them lots of money back
NT Is Tsumoru older or younger?
KO Younger
NT So your father is the oldest?
KO No, there are two more older brothers NT Does your father have any sisters?
KO They died young while I was still in Japan [END OF SIDE ONE]
NT --brothers and then him and then Tsumoru There were also two sisters one who died after she got married and one that died young before she got married?

Did the ship come to San Francisco or Los Angeles? Seattle
Oh, Seattle in 1920 What month did you get to America?

Oh, that is neat (pause) Your father was born in 1887 There is 1919, 12/5 How do they do it? Is that December fifth?
Yes, 1919. It was in May?

Oh, that is amazing that he wrote all of that down.
We had to have kind of a physical examination before they would even put you on the boat
In Japan or in America? Oh, when you left Japan you had to have a physical?
Well , not really a physical , they had a bad eye disease that is called torohomo or something It was something along that order. Maybe it was a lot more serious than that We had to leave their stools and they checked to see I had a hard time going so I got some from somebody else and I didn't pass (laughter) I was delayed twenty- five days because of that
Oh my goodness, shame on you Grandma! (laughter)
If I would have broke down and got my own, I probably wouldn't have had to wait all that time, but I got somebody elses. They came in Victoria instead of Seattle Oh, Victoria, Washington
We came to Seattle from Victoria through the immigration. We came to Seattle on May 26, 1920 We stayed at the immigration one night and they traveled the next day. We had to stay at the immigration one night and then I got
out the next morning at about 10:00 o'clock

It doesn't have to be that accurate The day I went to the station to go after him and I said to my family, "I will be back in a little while." Everybody was laughing at me because I was already promised to him They knew that I would never come back to the family again because officially I was an Okura and we were married.
So you just went to the station to get him and then went home with him?
I was officially married to him when I was seventeen So when I went I was already his wife I have a marriage picture that I took about two months after we had our get together
Oh, I see, so you actually did have a wedding ceremony? Between Okura and Sugawa, they don't live too far apart So I went to Okura and I never did go back to Sugawa Then two months later you had a wedding ceremony Okay, that is fine (laughter)
Everybody laughed at me
Did you know what was going to happen?
I was so innocent, I didn't know nothing
It was a big surprise, huh, Grandma? (laughter)

I don't think that I was especially working hard Everybody felt sorry for me because I was washing diapers and taking care of his brother's kids. Everybody used to feel sorry for me because I did almost everything I was
just like a slave or a hired hand When my sisters would come over and see all this, they would make an excuse and say, "Kosuye has to come over and stay with us for a month because I am going to do this " They would make excuses to take me away from there for a little time of my own to relax One sister would do that and come back and work a little while and then another sister would

So you were really lucky when you were little.
Then after I married Dad and I came to America I had a real tough life That was really distressing to me In Japan working in a coal mine was as low as you could get They weren't even humans because they were that low class When I found out that I was married to a miner, I didn't dare tell the people in Japan what my husband did So you didn't know when you came to America?
He was working on the railroad Before he went to Japan he was a section foreman
Where?
In Wyoming I guess that he was boss over there His brother Tsumoru lived in Kenilworth and he said, "Don't go back there, come and work over here and you will make better money " So after they brought me home to America, he started to work in the mines to my bitter disappoint- ment You know how they would come home with their faces all black? I felt so degraded to be that low from being raised at such a high class.

Did Grandpa know that you cried every day?
He did, he knew.
How did he feel? How did he treat you?
I was to ashamed to tell them what my husband did or how we were getting along
So they weren't getting along too well?
We were getting along alright, but we never told the people in Japan
Because he was a coal miner How did he feel when he knew that you were crying? Did he say, "So what?" Did he say that? What did he do?

drunk or anything, he would just drink his wine at a certain time every night but never to the point where he couldn't control himself
NT You mean you only remember him going on a binge two or three times?
FT Oh no , when we were younger
NT So when you were younger he used to go a binge very
often, but after you and Dad carne over only two or three
times before he died
FT The older he got the less he could handle, you know
There were periods of time that he wouldn't drink at all and he would be just like an ideal person He was just like Jeckle and Hyde

maybe twice a year he would really get out of hand, but other than that he wasn't too bad That was their only pleasure because they didn't go fishing, they didn't go

When they drink a little bit they get like they own the world so they like to gamble The single people go after the females, you know, the prostitutes Drinking, gambling, and playing with women were the three things that they did That is the only pleasure they had, that is the only thing that they knew I would say that 90 percent of the issei did this.
We didn't think of even buying land or buying a house at that time because always behind it was that thought that someday they might go back to Japan If we had $3,000 we could go to Japan
But it is hard to get $3,000
Three thousand dollars is probably about $30,000 or even more now
I bet it is pretty close to $50,000
If they hit $3,000 most people would go home to Japan Out of ten, only about three of them went back to Japan with money.

Did you and your husband plan to go back to Japan, take Mama and Aunt Cherry and all the kids and go back to Japan?
If we made $3,000 or more they would go back to Japan After World War II then most people decided that they should stay.
Why did you decide to stay here after World War II?
I guess we had no other choice really The children were grown here and all our children would be here and if they went to Japan they would miss us I think that it was after World War II that we were legally able to buy property too
Everybody just wanted to go back.
The men that you cooked for, that used to carry Mama, did a lot of them go back? Did the men from the boarding house go back?
I borrowed money from kyowaikai(?) or refinanced things, he wanted to go back bad enough that he did That was the only person that I know of that went back
Do you remember who he was?

There were a lot of people in Japan that were wealthy and they still worked in the coal mines too because the Japanese were foreigners and they couldn't speak and everybody was prejudiced No matter how much education the Japanese had, if they were to compete with a white, the white would get the job
FT Now, I know Chip's dad is very educated In fact, he went to high school in Japan and maybe graduated from Berke- ley At that time whether you had a college degree or not, he worked in the dry cleaning business because it didn't matter.
NT What made Grandpa decide to open up a cafe and leave the mine? Did the mine just close down?
FT Some of his friends said that there was no future in the mines because they were only working maybe three or four days a week, and then all the rest of the time they did not work There was just barely enough to live on So they decided that there was not future in the mines, so some of her friends even loaned them some money for them to come up and Helper.

they would come over here to our place and eat here They would eat a 25 cent hamburger steak Sometimes we would cook it for them and they wouldn't pay, they would run away.
That was during the depression years around 1936
1929 and 1930 was a depression I think that it took about six years before the economy got a little bit better. All those people that were transits would come and stop and loaded up I guess with water and stuff. We would all rush around like mad and get them feed and then they would leave without paying Other times we would have nothing to do but sit around About once a day they would come in and we would all rush like heck
Grandma, who taught you to cook in the first place? What were their names? You cooked Nihon style food in the boarding house.

Kato San, Yugawa San, Kido San, and Okura They thought that they were all unmarried .
The only experience that we had was what we had at the Bee Cafe
Then you opened the Price Cafe?
Yes, four partners did Yugawa San had some waitress experience He spoke quite fluent English, but the rest of them didn't So that made it kind of difficult
How long were your partners with you, Grandma, two years? I think about two years One of the partners that understood English used to be the cashier We kind of tested his honesty and found out that he was digging into the till for his own benefit We found out that this Yugawa San was taking money from the till, taking cigarettes home, and stuff like that So the rest of the three of them said, "I don't want to run this business anymore " So I think we paid $450 to buy the rest of them out It was $150 each that they did for the four partner- ships

We would cut it, slice it, and pound it We made our famous breaded veal . That is what really made our business good, our breaded veal We had a special way of making it Fred got the special part of the meat and we would cut it real thin and pound it in Then we graded it, put flour on it, some egg on it and then breaded it It would fry so pretty on the grill Then we would put a little bit of gravy, potatoes, and some vegetables. Like the Chinese people we would give them a real good serving Well , that really became famous when we started the Crest Like I said I couldn't help at all when we were in the Frontier Cafe and Fred would have to do it all During that time Midori, Yamaguchi, and Aiko were cooks

Yes , I have seen her cook
I just used to marvel at the way she had done things I think that because I lived close to her, I am slow I am just one speed, you know I can't work fast They were two of a kind and they think alike, a lot of their opinions are the same and their personality is so same in the way they think and everything Anyway, Grandma didn' t watch my kids or take care of the kids, she worked, she really worked It was a truck stop and it was a small place Alice and them worked for us, and Sherry

Who did you sell the Price Cafe to? Was it those Chinese people?

They are the ones that you promised that you wouldn't open another cafe in town.
There were two Chinese people, I think that they were partners that bought it I guess since we opened the Frontier they all came back to us.
I guess the Price didn't do to well?
No Later on I think that they sold it Midori, one of the ladies that used to cook there The Chinese people sold it to Midori. She had a fire and it was destroyed I don't know if there were rumors that she burned it down or not? I guess we were in the Frontier for nine or ten years Let's see we retired in 1977
It was 1976 because we were here then
Oh, alright, 1976 We ran it for thirteen years, so what would make it?

down for
1976 because I remember that
It really got so busy beyond our wildest dreams You see, I was able to help because the kitchen was bigger Toward the end he wanted to retire so bad it wasn't even funny It was just too much, it was more than we could handle.

She used to come and help us once in a while though We had so many parties. Business got so--we used to wash the dishes by the hand, but we had to have a dishwasher We just build it to wash dishes in the sink you know There was no way that we could catch up so we had to install the other kind dishwasher.

Oh yes, I remember that
The there was Jean Selmies, Greenwell, us and Crest. The three of us were the largest, the biggest base The mines were working pretty good then, so the people that came out and from Hiawatha or Wattis or Sunnyside all came over and ate with us On payday they would come and do the shopping and we were so busy The cafe business is really a nerve racking business We made cash On top of that we had Utah Power people that always had their dinner and they would sign Then the BLM when they had their fires, we had to make the sandwiches for them That happened about three or four times during the summers We would have to make a 100 sandwiches for them and put a roll and different things and make a sandwich and sell it for so much We used to get the whole crew in to make the sandwiches and stuff.

I got my first permanent there.

NT. For who? Grandma, you got your first permanent?
KO Yes, I did
FT I don't remember that When we went I was twelve
NT So they got your ear operated on?
FT Yes When was it that I got my glasses, Grandma? Did I
get that in Price or was it in Salt Lake? I think that I was about that age too I was so blind and I didn't know it
NT No, I was the same way and you don't realize it
FT Because you don't know how other people see and you know just your own capacity I remember in Moreland we had all
these newspapers because we didn't have any wallpaper You know there was a lot of smoke because the houses we
51

built weren't insulated and all the coal we burned It seemed like everything was still coal, so the paper that we had would go all black. So every spring Grandma put a new layer of newspaper out for our wallpaper. One time we were eating and he say's, "Can you read that right on top of there on the door?" Well, everyone could read it but me I finally realized that I wasn't seeing like I should, so I went and got my glasses. So maybe my eyes wouldn't have been--well I don't know because Bob has just as bad as eyes as I have I know that we went when he was in high school or younger even maybe I just gave my bad genes to all of my kids, every one of my kids wear glasses.
NT. Oh, everybody wears glasses these days That is interest- ing. So that time that you went to Salt Lake to have your ear operated on, you all stayed in the same room with your sisters in the Colonial Hotel Grandma went out and had her hair permed (laughter) It wasn't so bad, it sounds like it was kind of fun

In fact, when we were living in Helper we had a little duplex back right behind the Bee Cafe Then when we moved to Price we couldn't immediately find a place So we stayed in this dirty ugly basement until we could find a house

I had a appendicitis Doctor ---?--- was still there. He was young He took me in the hospital. They didn't know whether they should operate on me or let it go for a couple of more days and see I was never operated on, but boy, did I ever have a stomach-ache I don't know what I had, whether it was an appendix or whether it was a appendicitis?
Was this when you lived in Helper?
When Mom and Dad were doing the Bee Cafe. The whole are was a dungeon, I will never forget it Then when I first got married to Fred he bought me all new furniture and we moved into a brand new house that was just build I thought, "Oh, how rich is this man? How could he give me all of these things?" I had lived in yucky houses all of my life and grew up in poverty
What happened?
Let's see, how long did we stay there? It wasn't very
long and then we moved to Whittier.
So your first house was in Los Angeles or where was it? No, it was in Gardena
Then you left that house?
Yes, because Fred took a new job He used to work in the open-air markets in Los Angeles You know how they had

those fruit stands, well, he used to sell the fruits and vegetables. They had a fruit and vegetable stand In the back there would be the butcher shop or some of them had grocery stores on the side. But each section was ran by different people They had the fruit and vegetable section that the Japanese usually did Then one of his older friends that he knew and that he had worked for before wanted him to come back so we moved to Whittier
NT Then what did he do at Whittier?
FT He would do the same kind of work for his old boss I
think that they went to Japan while Fred worked for him. NT So what kind of living did you have there?
FT Well, it was an older house I used to do housework and
then later on--well, first they were going to try me out at the vegetable stand, but I was no good at that I was just too backward It would make me so mad, I would polish the apples and he would say, "Okay, set this up real nice." So I would polish them and put it up I thought that it looked pretty nice, but then Fred would come and say, "Oh, this looks dead, I will have to redo it " He would take everything that I had pain stakenly took an hour to put together and in just two minutes flat he had it all up there
NT So you started doing housework?
FT I worked for a principal in Montebello They used to go

golfing together and I used to clean house for them There was one lady there and that did nothing but play the piano I thought, "Oh, how would it be to go out golfing with your husband and have a beautiful home " They had a nice patio that had a roof on it and every- thing It was an enclosed patio, but it was so nice I worked for two different people
How long did that last?
Not very long?
Why not?
Well, in Whittier we had kind of a hard time finding a house because there was a lot of prejudice against Japanese. We finally found a house but it was in an alley It was kind of dark and dreary It was a very nice house, although we had no furniture in it, it was really a nice house We stayed there until the war broke out and then we sold and stored all of our stuff We had a Plymouth that we sold for about--I think that we only had about a $150 when we came over here
Grandma and Grandpa had $350.
So she loaned us the money to buy the first car, so we could go to the grocery store We couldn't buy groceries unless we had a car. So we bought a Dodge I think that we borrowed money from Grandma and we bought this Dodge that was white. Fred used to do the shopping and buy

everything and then bring it back to the cafe and he did the preparation. He paid $8,000 for this property and we paid cash for it. Dominic Patino used to live here
Oh, did he have a house on the property?
My house was a cinder block house and it ended where my kitchen is Some of my bedrooms, that part by the TV was a bedroom. That part that Fred is living in was a bedroom Then we had the kitchen and the living room and that was all, and there was a back porch on it Shortly after that we build three bedrooms in the back and made that basement, that part of the basement, and then we built a garage. We did it little by little. I don't know How does it feel for both of you I mean you have lived in all of these crummy houses to watch your grand kids building these great big new houses How do you feel about that? Grandma, you are first, how do you feel about that?
I am happy. Are you?
I am very happy You know they say, "Oh, we are so poor we haven't got anything " But they have a washing machine, they live in a nice house and they are still complaining because they don't have any money When we were poor we didn't even have money to eat really. I remember Mrs Budouse(?) all the time saying that they

We were fortunate that we had a garden Dad always raised chickens and rabbits We raised rabbits because they multiplied fast and we always had meat on the table
KO Everything that we would buy we would buy at the company store They would charge it for us and we would pay whatever we can
NT Yes, the script, that is what it was the script
KO The company gave us $25. It was kind of like a coupon or
something Nowadays you are spoiled, you think so?
NT Yes, I am probably spoiled Grandma
KO It is unfortunate that there is so many people that are
homeless, but if you provide for them that only makes them lazier We would never impose on anybody, we would make it on our own
NT You did very well.
FT I can remember when Grandma was washing those things for
sheets in the winter time. She did it all by hand and they didn't have any hot water, you had to heat it on the stove. In the winter time there was no place to hang it out and there was no place in our home, so we would hang it out on the line and the sheets would all turn to ice They would be stiff with ice because it is not like you can do it in the ringer and take all the moisture out when you could do it only by hand It is so cold or so

hot but you can't ring it out. I have seen her bringing horne stiff clothes and we would drape it all around by the fire to try to get it dry Can you imagine washing those sheets by hand
Have you ever cooked on a coal stove?
Oh, no I haven't cooked on a coal stove. I know people who did, but I never did
You would try to make a cake and it says 350 degrees Sometimes there is too much coal in there and sometimes it would burn and sometimes it is not hot enough and it wouldn't cook
KO: You would have to get up early and start the fire
FT I didn't have an automatic washer, I would wash the diapers in one of those ringer types I would used the
same water over and over until it got black, you know NT Oh
KO Did you wash everything by hand?
FT Not very much. I did when I first married Fred because we
didn't have a washer
NT You washed everything by hand?
FT We had one of those that had the ringer and you had to
rinse by hand. Nowadays, you just throw it in the washing machine and you don't have to dry it and put in the dryer and everything, that is heaven Even the diapers, you buy the disposable ones God, I washed diapers until the

At that time everyone was in the same way--
Yes, because everybody was poor, we could make a compari- son, so we felt that we were just normal
Well, I think for Carbon County you were normal
We could divide up that county sometimes
We had to walk over a mile going and a mile coming back to go to school and go and do the shopping or something
In the winter time when we would come home from school it would be dark Sometimes when we have to go in the summer time it was so hot Grandma says, "Okay, you go to the store for me and buy a pound of bologna and buy this and buy that Then I will buy you 25 cents worth of candy " So we would come home and, boy, if you would buy 25 cents you would get quite a bit. We had those penny candies and you can get two or three for a penny for some of them We would come home and we would divide it into three That candy was so rare and such a goody to us that we used to say, "I am going to eat this one, what kind are you going to eat Cherry?" (laughter) She said, "Oh, I have already ate these two, and I got more than you " We would just treasure it. We were in Moreland at Christmas time and Santa Clause never came to us for Christmas The only Christmas that I really remember is when Mama bought us one of those rubber dolls It was a newborn baby doll

She had bought the three of us the same kind We made clothes for it, we named it, and we would play by the hours with it. That was all we got, maybe a little nuts too. I never had a tricycle, I never had a sleigh, and I never had any toys Sometimes when Tsumoru San used to come, dad's brother, my uncle, he used to buy us jacks or marbles We thought that was so great We really used to look forward to that The only thing that I really enjoyed during Moreland is when one of Grandmas best friends bought us a little phonograph It was one of the new kinds It was just a little box about that high and the record was over hanging more or less It was not the little one or not the big one, it was a middle size one The seventy-eights

What about the Terashimas?
Yes, he said that he was born in Moreland, but when I had seen them they were all grown up though I think that they must have just come for a visit He is the big shot in the Buddhist church His brother Dan was the photogra- pher for a long time It is funny that when you work so hard for your money and you have been brought up so poor, you really don't know how to enjoy your money Really, I know that I can do things and buy things, but I have no desire to buy it because I think that I had better save up for a rainy day, or maybe I am going to live long and I would have to have that money so that I won't feel insecure, so I don't spend it. I really don't know how to enjoy it
I think that a lot of people are like that
Because we had to do without so much Even things like the use of a plastic bag or even foils Everybody would use it once and throw it away We think, "Oh, I will save

I think that you earn your luck, I really do It doesn't just happen.
I told her that it is because of her that everybody likes her and respects her Now, if she was a grouchy old
person or always yelling, nobody would pay any attention to her She has earned her respect
When I went to Japan in 1950 I made up my mind before I went that I was going to tell my brother all about the hardships and tell every one of her relatives what I went through, but I couldn't Nobody still knows all the suffering that I went through
