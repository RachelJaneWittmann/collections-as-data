GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO ON
[FOR THE UTAH URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT. TAPE # 1 ] .
CE: Thank you very much Mr. Moore for taking time to talk with me this afternoon. I appreciate the opportunity.
I'm very happy with the very fine reception I ¥ve received here with Union Carbide. As you know, were are developing a uranium history on the Colorado Plateau. Before we talk about your á particular contribution to Union Carbide and to the industry would you tell me where you were born, and where you were raised and educated?
JM: Well, yes. I was born in New Orleans, Louisiana about 54 years ago, and grew up throughout Texas and wound up during my high school years in Aramillo, Texas,
which I now call home. My parents still live there. I'm the first of eight children, and during the depression years I was determined to come to Colorado so--I had an uncle living in Uravan, Colorado at that time in 1938. So I wiggled a trip out of Texas to Colorado to go deer hunting. I liked the canyon country and the mountainous country so well I decided
to get a job, and a job was offered to me at Uravan, Colorado, with the old U.S. Vanadium Corporation, which was a subsidiary of Union Carbide. The only job they had to offer at the time was counting nuts and

 J.P. MOORE #1
bolts in a warehouse. They were taking inventory and were preparing to shut down. I took the job and they never shut down. I've been with them 32 years. It seemed to continue from one job to another from the warehousing job. I did work in the mines for a short period of the survey crew. I got out of the mines because I did not like the mines at all and worked in the plants for a year. Throughout the plants I called myself the general clean-up man at that time. For about a year I did a little bit of all labor work.
CE: In what area now?
JM: In the mill itself.
CE: Describe the mill in 1 39 and '40.
JM: Well, at the time it consisted of a roast of the ore
with sodium chloride, water leaching to extract the vanadium and the tailings which then contained the uranium ore [and] were stockpiled. At that time there was no idea that they would ever use uranium. It was a drag on the market. They only used the high grade they could get out of the mines and took that to other processing plants to extract the radium at that time or use some of the uranium for coloring bottles and so forth, but it was very minor use of uranium during that period. So we spent years stockpiling the tailings. In those days it was called the tailing
2

 J.P. MOORE #1
pile. Not knowing at that time, around the 1940 and
'41 period that they would be having a major use for uranium. After working in the plant approximately a year I talked my way into laboratory and worked as an analyst for several years. At that time the chief chemist was George Smith, an old time chemist throughout the area who has since passed away. I worked with him for quite a number of years. He was very kind to me and he taught me all that I could learn from him. Another chemist came along, Mr. W.P. Schoder who taught me quite a bit of chemistry, and I took up a correspondence course and I learned chemistry. I never had the opportunity to go to college, but I found the chemistry so intriguing I decided to make a profession of it. I did lots of studying at nights and off the job. In about the 1941-42 period they began to want uranium ore. They didn't tell us why they wanted it. They just said they had to have it, and they began to reprocess ore tailings for uranium. Therefore they extended the plants from a roasting process to roasting and acid leaching. In the roast they took the vanadium out leaving the uranium. Then they extracted the uranium with an acid leach and make a crude sludge that contained about 8% or 10% uranium which then was
3

 J.P. MOORE #1
taken to another plant for processing. About that time the AEC became quite active. They established their main office in Grand Junction. They built a plant in Grand Junction to reprocess this sludge.
CE: Now when was this?
JM: In about the 1942-43 period.
CE: These were the Manhattan engineers rather than any-- JM: Yes, this continuation of the Manhattan project,
Atomic Energy Commission and everything at that time was a super secret. No one really knew what the uranium was being used for and it was kept that way until the first atomic bomb was exploded at, I think, Nagasaki or Hiroshima. I don't know, whichever was the first one. [Hiroshima] That's when we knew that we were making uranium for an atomic bomb. We did not know before that time. I was transferred from Uravan to Grand Junction in about 1944 and worked two years in the Grand Junction plant as chief chemist where during those years it evolved down to where all the chemists were women chemists. We had ten or twelve at Navy. We had an analyst and had to train another. over a period of two years we trained over 35 women chemists to do the job until the war was over
with.
CE: What was your job in particular here during that
4

 J.P. MOORE #1 time?
JM: CE: JM:
In Grand Junction as chief chemist and a--
As chief chemist, what was your job?
There was a plant there in Grand Junction, and we did all the analytical work for the final products that were coming out of the plant. We had a vanadium product, and the vanadium product which was in those
days had a secret code: B.J. I'm sure it's well known nowadays, and I can say B.J. was the secret code for our high grade. In those days the high grade only consisted of about 17 to 20% uranium which was then further processed back to high grade, a stannous fluoride of some sort before it went into the gaseous diffusion process at Oak Ridge, Tennessee and Handford, Washington. After being in Grand Junction and with quite a few experiences including--! didn't help catch the spy, but they did catch a Japanese spy there. It never appeared in the paper but--
Where was this?
In Grand Junction here. Oh really?
A Japanese woman was noted to be consistently ice skating down below the plant. We had guards with machine guns around the plant all the time, and one of the guards noticed her and spotted her taking
CE: JM: CE: JM:
5

 J.P. MOORE #1
pictures of the plants. She was a Japanese woman here just to take pictures of the plant and they caught her, and I don't know what ever happened. It was a super secret; they never said a word. It never appeared in the paper, but we happened to know that.
CE: How do you know she was guilty?
JM: I don't know what they considered her. Of course any
foreign nationality that weren't for the United States was considered guilty of something at that time it seems. You can remember how they picked up all the Japanese people on the west coast and put them in internment camps and so on. They just weren't supposed to be there. The main evidence was she had a powered telescopic camera taking pictures of the plant and I'm sure that right there was a sure sign that she was trying to seek any information that she could. But the plant finally shut down in Grand Junction after the war years and I was transferred to Brighton, Colorado, where we have a plant which produces both uranium and vanadium. I was there from 1947 to 1949 as an analyst working for Mr. Paul Gravers, chief analyst, doing a variety of work, just kind of filling in between jobs nearly. Uravan over a period of time there had shut down and then [they] decided they needed to reactivate Uravan again, so in
6

 J.P. MOORE #1
1949 I was assigned the job of going back to Uravan starting a laboratory and doing the analytical work as chief chemist for Uravan.
CE: Compare those two times between the 3o's and the early 40's when you where there and then the late 40's. How did Uravan change?
JM: Well, from the time when I first came there to the time that I went back Uravan had gone downhill tremendously because they had shut down the plant and the windows were all out of the buildings. We had to go back in and rejuvenate it. [It was a] completely broken down plant, [we] really completely overhauled it. It's difficult to compare other than we had new processes. We had to tear the old plant partially down to rebuild. The acids, the sodium chloride, the fumes form the plant are so corrosive that they had corroded many portions of the building and they practically had to be torn down and built over at that time, all except the roasters. So they started importing and rebuilding and started processing ore
again in Uravan.
CE: Was there a pollution problem in the early '40s, do
you remember?
JM: No, to our knowledge there wasn't. We went fishing
down in the river and never failed to catch all the 7

 J.P. MOORE #1
fish we wanted. There were probably some materials going into the river. That's natural around in the plant that wasn't watching pollution like they are nowadays. But there really wasn't any control or attempt to control pollution at that time in the
'4Os. It's only in your recent years that they are trying to get complete control over pollution, but in those days we didn't have retaining ponds; we did have some ponds down below the plant that they would put sludges and slimes in. We tried not to just put anything in the river but the general--I'm sure the solution did go down the river at that time. Everybody knows that.
tremendous tailings pond just this side of Uravan where all of this solution goes, into these tailing ponds before they drain through gravel beds and into the river. In the case of the 1940s, we didn't ever analyze for pollution controls. Now we analyze for all the effluences that go out of the plant. We do all that work here in Grand Junction and we maintain a very tight control over effluences coming from the plants, but in those days you were many miles from nowhere, and even a lot of trees along the river died
D id---?---?
CE:
JM: Yes, but now when you go to Uravan you see a
8

 J.P. MOORE #1
because the fumes from the smog uphill, sodium chloride.
CE: Is that from the stack?
JM: Yes. In those days there really was no control over
it. We had a scrubber making acids down there, but some fumes always got by. But to continue on my working part of it, I stayed at Uravan until July, 1952. Then I was transferred from Uravan back to Rifle where they were planning a research laboratory. So I did go back to Rifle and worked as a product man for several years. Then in 1954 they set up and built a new research lab in Grand Junction and I helped design it; at least the analytical portion of it was the first analysis in the building. I have some pictures downstairs if you want to see them. I'11 show you some of them. I have a history of Union Carbide from around 1952 up to about 1960, I believe, in picture form, and you might like to look at it after we get through here.
CE: Do you want to talk about the method of separating uranium from other metals?
JM: Well the main metals that you separate uranium from are the gain materials that are silica materials and vanadium. We are in the business for both vanadium and uranium products. Therefore, do you want to know
9

 J.P. MOORE #1
in those days or now?
CE: Compare.
JM: Compare. In the 1930s through '45 the main changes
are in the final processing of the uranium and vanadium. In the earlier days we came up with a product for vanadium that contained considerable potassium and other salts, and we could only make grades of around 87 to 89%. Nowadays our grade can
range from 99% up to 120%. Now people wonder, "How can you get 120% grade?" It's a deficiency of oxygen content [which] is much more than the V-205. Therefore when you express it as V-205 it upgrades it, exaggerates it. In other words, theoretically you can get around 121% V-205, expressed as V-205. It's actually a much lower oxygen valency state of vanadium.
CE: Were you instrumental in improving these methods with Union Carbide?
JM: Probably the only instrument I was in improving the methods was through our analysis of the research work that went on during this period. We had a reasonably well-organized research group which worked on these various product lines and they did the researching and the experimentation to change the products. I was instrumental in seeing that the analytical work [was
10

 J.P. MOORE #1
done] in the earlier days. Now I do every little analytical work. In the former days I did a lot of
CE: JM: CE: JM:
CE: JM:
it.
Why?
Huh?
Why not now I mean?
It's very difficult to supervise about 12 people and do all the other various clerical work and other work that is involved at the moment and do analytical work. I just don't have the time in other words--
Do you miss that?
I do very definitely, but there's nothing I can do about it. Finally I'm evolving down to an 8-hour job chemist I hope, instead of working so many hours that I did in the past. I'm not getting younger, and so as far as vanadium is concerned--uranium has been upgraded from the earlier days in Grand Junction from around 17 to 19% product to a product that can run as
high as 99.9%, and that work was done here in Grand Junction, the upgrading of it since the Grand Junction lab was in existence. To continue its final form we had the research lab in Rifle from 1954 to 1958. Then in 1958 they decided to build this research lab and abandon the one in Rifle. Therefore I helped design the chemical section of this lab.
11

 J.P. MOORE #1
Then we moved to Grand Junction around July, 1958, and have been here ever since 1958.
CE: What percent of uranium do you recover from this carnotite ore? You have a piece of ore. What is extracted besides rock which is disposed of?
JM: Oh, extraction varies with the process. Compared to the '30s and the early '40s, we extracted nothing because we didn't go after it. We stockpiled it. Now we make every effort to get up in the 90% range of what is in the ore. Every pound of uranium is worth a considerable dollar, so you go after every little bit you can that is economically feasible.
CE: That's logical, isn't it?
JM: And also it will range according to the process. It
will range to according to the ore going into the
plant.
CE: Is some easier to work with than others?
JM: A lot of ores are more amenable to our process than
others. You have real high lime ores that the company doesn't like to process due to their acid consumption capability like any high carbonate consumes considerable acids and makes the process quite costly. So we try to use low carbonate ores. We have many types of materials that do come through our plants that are high carbon, high metallic, high
12

 J.P. MOORE #1
silicious matter. Some are types that are tied up in silicates. Other types are very amenable to process, and that's the reason we have a metallurgical group here in Grand Junction before any new ore is processed through ore plants; they make a thorough study of that ore, a series of tests that simulates plants processing, and that is our portion of the
job, to analyze there a work to see if the ore is amenable to our processes. So a lot of our work has involved the analytical, from the metallurgical, analytical [end of it] for many other groups that are stationed in Grand Junction.
CE: Is a difficult mineral to recover; is either vanadium [or uranium] difficult to recover?
JM: I don't think it's one of the more difficult minerals to recover. In fact it's one of relatively easy-- vanadium is relatively easier to recover say then tungsten or some other types of mineralization. It takes knowledge and knowhow to recover any minerals. You have to make tests and learn how to do it before you could just go out and recover. You have to build a plant that's amenable to the recovery process.
CE: Yes it does.
JM: It sounds easy, I wasn't [around in theJ earlier
period and to me it seems easy now. It wasn't when I 13

 J.P. MOORE #1
first started.
CE: Where is it done primarily, this work, recovery of the two minerals?
JM: Vanadium and uranium? Well, our primary plants at the moment are at Uravan, Rifle, and Gas Hills. I'm sure of that.
CE: But each of those is designed for a specific job, isn't that right?
JM: Each plant.
CE: Uravan and Rifle are designed for different jobs,
aren't they?
JM: Well at the time the Rifle plant is our principal
vanadium producer but also produces uranium. The Uravan plant produces in final form the uranium product and also concentrates vanadium for the Rifle plant; the goal is uranium [at that] plant only.
CE: Union Carbide was interested, however, in both, aren't they? They aren't interested exclusively in uranium.
JM: No, we're interested in both vanadium and uranium. As far as Union Carbide itself they are interested in only minerals or metal that they can recover or extract for the profit. For instance, just digressing a little, we have a Bishop tungsten plant and we have an asbestos plant in California, and many other
14

 J.P. MOORE #1
plants all over the world. So we're just a small segment of a uranium boom. At the time I went to work
CE:
JM: CE: JM: CE: JM: CE:
JM: CE: JM:
CE:
JM:
for them as I earlier described I had no idea that I would be with them as long as I am, so it now appears that I'll retire with them.
After 31 years do you think it appears that way?
Didn't you say 31 years? 32.
32 years.
It would be very long.
I guess it would be.
I started at about 22.
As we discussed before we began the interview, would you like to develop a history of the process of recovering uranium and vanadium in an academic manner?
That might be.
Is it too much of an order?
That might be difficult for me. We have people here that probably could do a little better emphasis on it. These people are on vacation.
I probably won't have an opportunity to talk with
them, will I?
I would rather not try to develop a metallurgy or the
history at this time. I would have to do some 15

 J.P. MOORE #1
thinking on it. As I say I have not been that closely associated in the plant and I have been in a position to be in that phase of the operation. I've been strictly analytical producing the results so other people can develop a process. Therefore it would probably take considerable fore-thought to really give you an accurate picture of a development process. Probably I shouldn't attempt that. It might be a little out of my scope.
CE: Well, do you know whether Union Carbide has been one of the pioneers in this area in developing these processes?
JM: Oh, yes, I'm sure of that due to the fact that they were among the first people into the country with enough faith in the country to stay with it. Vanadium Corporation of America did have plants at Naturita and Durango, but they are now not as such a company. They were brought out by Foote Mineral and are no longer known as Vanadium Corporation of America to my knowledge. So you do have other people that have come into the area after Union Carbide had been in operation, for say, 20 years or longer. Then other people began to get interested. Kerr-McGee, lots of those began to get deposits over in New Mexico and other areas. Charlie Steen found his mine. Atlas
16

 J.P. MOORE #1
Corporation built a plant. After uranium went up to a high level of dollar volume then a lot of the people began to come in, but they still used known processes when they first started, but I'm sure during that period they did a lot of their own developing because
they had ores that were different than ours. So you had to do some processing, but during that period I think it should be said that the Atomic Energy Commission through a contract with National Lead did lots of development work with plants. They took contract on ore types and did initiate some of the solvent extraction methods used to isolate uranium from other minerals such as molybdenum, copper, and some of the other elements that are associated with the ore. So the AEC and National Lead did a lot of work on it themselves.
CE: The AEC initiated this?
JM: They did quite a bit of it. Now, whether they
initiated it on their own or through other people I don't know, but in those days they were trying to produce a large quantity of uranium and they were making every effort to help the plants find newer and cheaper methods of extracting uranium. So they were really experimenting on many different types of metallurgy for several years in the period that they
17

 J.P. MOORE #1
were trying to increase production of uranium. That was during the years actually after the first atomic bomb and they were trying to get more uranium to make more atomic bombs during that crash period. They use this means to try to have production increase.
CE: What am--is the chemistry department, you have resolved these problems of what process could you be working on now?
JM: Well, I'm sure their one problem resolved there seems to be another problem coming up. [There's] always a continuing group of problems being presented through change in ore---?--- new types of materials coming in. As I said earlier we're constantly doing amenability work, testing so that we can accept the ore. So our principal work at the moment is analytical work for the plants. Rifle does not have a laboratory, therefore we do all our mill controls in Grand Junction. We have an ore exploration group that is exploring for minerals throughout the United States and we do all of our analytical work here.
CE: Oh, I see.
JM: Just to show you that we do have a lot of work.
CE: I thought that you were exclusive to the Plateau.
JM: No, I'm not exclusive because we have all the other
plants send a variety of samples to us to check 18

 J.P. MOORE #1
[their] work. We do the pollution work for several
CE: JM:
CE: JM:
plants back east, Marita plant, Columbia plants, all the samples come here. So we do have a wide variety of analytical work for it over a period of time.
Are you going to resolve the pollution problem? Absolutely, if you go to Rifle today it would be amazing. You would think the plant was shut down today.
I've heard that story and--
There was quite a haze over the valley. They spent lots of money trying to find out why, and they did and they corrected it. They asked for a variance and Union Carbide is the first company that asked for the variance and Union Carbide is the first company that asked for the variance to be discontinued. It was a little out of the norm for a plant to come back
[after] such a short period and say, "We aren't polluting the air any longer; we don't need a variance."
We need you in Southern California.
Well the last time I was in Southern California I don't think I'll go back from the looks of it. It was pretty bad, but its going to take more effort than just a few people on the part of California because after all, Rifle had one plant. Look what California
CE: JM:
19

 J.P. MOORE #1 has.
CE:
JM: CE: JM:
It really isn't the plants there as much as it is the automobiles.
Well, a combination of all.
About 80 some odd percent is estimated automobiles.
I just talked with a person, I won't mention any names here, because he's just invented a new catalyst they are trying to get on the market for automobile exhaust and they claim it's supposed to work very well, but they've in a patent state so if somebody will come up with a usable catalyst or something to put on these automobiles and to cut out the carbon monoxide and the carbon going into the air, then they might start cleaning the air up. Either that or a lot of people are going to have to get used to the idea of walking I think.
That's the ultimate solution, isn't it?
That's right.
Is there anything else you would like to contribute, Mr. Moore, before we conclude?
I did have some old a procedures that you might be interested in. I painted these quite some years ago from Uravan when I was there. They're from the old
Standard Chemical Company who had an office in Naturita, Colorado. The procedures are dated April 1,
CE: JM: CE:
JM:
20

 J.P. MOORE #1
1914, and they're the old time methods used in the days before Union Carbide or U.S.U. came to the area. They're quite unique in that they were very tedious and had many separations, and in the final form were considered quite inaccurate after full studies were made of the procedures, but apparently they were entirely adequate in those days when there was no great need for as much analytical work for uranium. Now in the days of--for the last 10 years so many new technologies have come out on uranium analysis that we've gone to instrumentation. In many cases right
for 8's is one method we use, and we use the floor metric method. There are very abrasive colormetric methods. So the methods I have in my hand here were quite antique, when it took maybe 3 days to analyze a battery of maybe 8 uraniums. Now one man can analyze 125 in one shift and do 125 in ---?--- vanadium of they're on the instruments. So it's quite a change over a period of years. Here are the methods. You might be interested in having a copy of these for your record.
CE: I would. That would be wonderful if we could put this along with the tape.
JM: That will be fine, and I'll see that you get a copy, can get a copy tonight.
21

 J.P. MOORE #1
CE: Alright, we will talk about that. Thank you very
much, Mr. Moore.
JM: W ell, you're quite welcome.
