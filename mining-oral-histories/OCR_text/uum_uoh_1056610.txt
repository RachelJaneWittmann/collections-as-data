 THIS I S AN INTERVIEW WITH IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER FOR THE SOUTHEAST UTAH PROJECT BY SUZANNE SIMON AT HANKSVILLE, UTAH, AT THE WEBER'S HOME ON JULY 9, 1971 AT 10:00 AM.
[TAPE #1.]
SS: Well, Mrs. Weber, you said that you were a granddaughter of Ebenezer Hanks that first came in here and settled this, is that right?
Uh-huh.
IW: SS: IW:
ss: IW:
SS: IW: SS: IW: SS: FW:
IW: FW:
And what were you parents' names?
My mother's name was Nellie MacDougal and my father was Dennis Burdell Newcombe.
I see.
My mother was the first child ever born in Hanksville.
Is that right? When was that, what year?
In 1884.
1884.
Eighth or the eighteenth.
And your parents, Mr. Weber, came quite early?
Well, I think about 1900. They were known among the first few settlers over here.
---?--- came before or not, do you have just a few--
Well, I ---?---, the Stoddards, I think it was, got there ahead of our own parents. I couldn't tell you the exact time that they located here. Offhand I would say about 1890. That's really a guess, however it's pretty close.
SS: What were your mother and father's names?

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
FW:
SS:
FW:
IW: FW:
SS: FW: SS: FW:
SS: FW: SS:
FW:
Oh, Father's name was Franz Joseph Weber, Mother was Cecilia Stoddard, her maiden name.
Where did they come from when they came into this country?
Well, father was from Germany or Austria, and mother was from around---?--- and she was born---?---
In Loa.
But her folks are immigrants. She was born in Wayne County, that'd be Loa, the county seat there.
Was your father Mormon when he came into the country? No, nor when he went West either.
Is that right?
He never did join the Church. He died in '33, yeah, in 1933.
Well, then when were you married?
1925.
1925. Did you father go in, was he in the livestock business?
No, no, he--I have been more or less all my life, but our folks weren't.
SS: What did they do?
FW: Well, they ran a hotel and feed yard here. That was
in the days of horses, you know. Well, he had a farm too. Well, you might say just whatever he could. He was by trade a stonesman, and he built more or less
2

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
the rock structures that were in the area at the time.
Out ---?--- ranch. He was the mason that did that work.
Oh, I hadn't been out there yet, are there still some of the buildings out there?
Well, there's BLM. It's a kind of novelty the way
IW:
SS:
FW:
IW:
it's put together, one thing and another. The fact, I guess, that it's the only one in the area of it's kind, they may have for that reason been particularly taken care of.
He did lots of mason work on this old church building over here. But the sand one, that was--the sand wasn't, because that was a square and it stood there for several years, and finally another fellow came along that they hired.
Did he do any of the buildings down at Giles?
No, I don't think so. I never heard him say he did.
I just--we went out this morning to try and see if we could see anything down there, and just that one stone building that--we weren't dressed to go out
hiking across the river bottom. Besides that I guess the deerflies or something nearly ate me up when I got out of the car. But somebody told us that there were stone buildings there, and that's why I wanted
SS: FW: SS:
3

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER to--
IW: Well, did that belong to Abbotts, that old farm?
FW: Well, that was on that roadside, the old building right along the highway there. My father came to this country with the people that had the dredge on the Colorado River, which is kind of historical. He came in here with those people and he started his beginning in this country; he came here. He was sort of a foreman over the freight. They built roads and
so on to get down to where the dredge was put in.
IW: --about the dredge from Utah University.
SS: Well, he worked handling the freight and overseeing
the--
FW: He was a sort of an overseer over the teams and the
freight. He arranged to have it brought in and he
hired and so on. That's the way I understand.
ss: There must have been quite a large crew of men down
there working on the dredge.
FW: Oh, there must have been. They did quite a lot of
road work through there in those days, with what means they had to do it. So they must have either spent quite a lot of time or there were quite a few.
IW: The road went up over the middle of the mountains, Stanton Pass. There's a road up through there now.
SS: Is that the road that goes up to Bullfrog? 4

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER FW: No, that¥s--
ss:
FW:
SS: FW:
IW:
SS:
FW:
SS:
IW:
I really am having trouble getting myself oriented in this country.
It's Lowell Pass over between the mountains. But what she's referring to is Stanton Pass, and it's a sort of a shortcut from here through to where that dredge was put in.
Oh, I see.
In place of going down around the mountains toward Bullfrog where the Bullfrog lane is they went what would be a shorter course, up over the mountains.
It's a way out by what we call Half Ranch now. It's owned by a King. That's Half Ranch and all of the pass.
Well, let me see, you were married and then just settled down right here.
That's right, I was born, raised, married, and I'll probably die right here, I guess. That's outrageous, perhaps.
When did you go to high school? Did you go out and board and live in Green River?
outside of Jefferson High school in Green River, I guess. Well, at first we went to Bicknell, my cousin and I rented a room from a lady, two rooms of her
house and we kept house for ourselves. 5

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
SS: That must have been very exciting for a young girl.
IW:
SS: IW:
SS: FW:
IW:
SS: IW:
Yeah, I got high marks that year at Christmas time. The school teacher was from here that was there, was from Bicknell.
In the elementary school?
Yes, and my father took them up as far as Molen. The teacher's brother brought my cousin and I down that far in exchange.
Well, that saved him a few miles, didn't it?
That was one of the handicaps several of the people had.
After that I went to Green River and stayed with Mrs. Ecker the next year when I was living in Green River. Now which Mrs. Ecker?
Edna Ecker. She's Robinson now. she was Mrs. Cornelius Ecker. My mother's sister ---?--- when I was there the first time. My folks moved over there for a few years and put the kids in school.
SS: How many brothers and sisters did you have?
IW: Three brothers and four sisters, eight of us in the
family.
SS: How about your family?
FW: There were five of us, three boys and two girls.
SS: Did any of the others, your brothers and sisters
still live in this area?
6

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
FW: Well, yes, in this area, one of them lives at Price
and one up here at Bicknell and both sisters are
dead.
SS: How about your brothers and sisters?
IW: They're all living.
SS: Are they in this area or how many are still?
IW: Well, let's see, I'm in town and two of them are in
Green River, one in Bicknell and one out in
Roosevelt.
SS: Sounds as though the families are fairly close to you
out here. Anyway, while we're talking about this, how
many children did you have?
IW: Four, four daughters.
SS: Four daughters. Are they nearby?
FW: Well, they are more scattered than our immediate
family. We have one girl who 1ives here, one in Bicknell, one in Salt Lake, and one in Idaho Falls. So, as time went on and the roads got better and the access in and out of here got better, of course, the wider they scatter, more people, more different ways to go. We were more or less fenced in in our day; you just kind of married within your circle and you couldn't get out of it unless you walked, so you stayed here.
ss: Oh, there are the cutest people down in your area. 7

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
FW: I think I could make the statement that I lived
longest in Hanksville. Of course, you know, I'm not the oldest by any means of the people that are here, but this has been my home all my life. Mrs. Edna Ecker's older than I am and we have another gentleman here, Hearnst, that's older than I am, but they've 1i ved here. I 've been gone a good deal since I was married. My wife and the girls were always here, but I had to go elsewhere to get the bacon. This has always been our home, Hanksville.
SS: Well, what about numbers living here? Was Hanksville ever much larger than it is now, or has it been just kind of mostly the same?
FW: No, I think pretty much the same. I actually believe maybe in 1912, 15, along there, there were probably more families here than there are now. I think we've stayed pretty much the same all along. I think there's--the population's been between a hundred, a hundred and fifty for all the time.
IW: There were more people in Caineville years ago than there are now, a good deal more. There used to be a fairground. They'd have dances and go back and forth. On the way back we'd stop by and go to the fair. Sometimes we'd go in a wagon even, but in later years we had cars. The first time I remember was on a
8

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
wagon.
SS: I'll bet that was a lot of fun. IW: Yes, it was.
SS: FW:
You must really love to dance.
W ell, people have changed in a
notice that. A lot of the time people in general are not like they were twenty-five, thirty years ago. They don't have the time, everybody's in a hurry and
just here and there. It seems strange, too, that we remarked about how--I don't know if this would be very interesting for the tape, but we've sometimes remarked about how we lived here and our only means of transportation was by horses or foot. You had time to visit people, you know, your acquaintances, and if you went through the country you would arrange to visit them or even stay with them overnight. Now we buzz along on the highway and if we have a neighbor close by and he happens to be out in his field there, and we honk and wave at him and let him know who we are, we think we've really done something big to even recognize him, see. In those days it would have been almost an offense to pass him up without spending the time of day with him, you know. Even your means of transportation was slower. Now a little visit wouldn't matter to you in the daytime with a car, but
9
general way,
you' 11

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
that much time with horses would mean you wouldn't get in until dark or so.
ss: Yeah, that is funny. It looks like the more time saved we have the less time we have. I think that is interesting that--
IW: If you come off on this pass in a car on the desert, we usually knew who was coming and we'd stop and they'd stop too and talk a minute. Now you hardly know who you're passing. They pass so fast that you just--
FW: They're not really interested in a little out of the way community like this. It gets hard to realize how people got along with the way that they did, you know, but they worked together. For example, if a fellow á was going somewhere, he would find out what his neighbor needed, and if he could help him while he was gone, and even if--after we had cars for the first few years--there wouldn't any of us thinking of leaving town without finding out if we could do something for one of the neighbors while we were gone, and that way they got along better. Now, I don't know, it's got to be such a common thing and
you just don't pay any attention. When you get ready to go, you just go. Nobody knows where you're going and when you're coming back, and they don't care.
10

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
SS:
Yeah, well, I was raised in a town that was just a 1ittle but larger than this, but it was a farming community and still is. It's not a big town by any means at all, I guess maybe there are 2,000 people there, but everyone knew everyone. I mean you kind of got into the habit of doing things together, and if
somebody's in trouble you help them out, and enjoy times together.
Well, that was your entertainment. I mean, if you didn't there was nothing else. You made your recreation, and as strange as it may seem, we had better times, we felt better. Oh, people were sociable and I don't know, it seemed like just people don't have the time for people any more.
Well, when you were raising--you talked about making your own recreation when you were growing up, and we got caught comparing times, and the things that you did for entertainment. How was it for your children when they were growing up, were they content too? Well, now, it was similar, but still that was in the days when the roads were improved and there were automobiles all through this area. Maybe not so many locally owned, but they would more or less travel in those days. They had opportunities to go to different places. Then they were of course, all our children
FW:
SS:
FW:
11

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
had to go to high school. They didn't have to rely so much on their own for recreation; there were things to go to in different towns, and they could go, you know. When we were children here we didn't go like even up to Loa or over to Green River, it would have been about a three days drive with the team. Unless you really had to go you didn't go because it was--we, like I said, made our own recreation. I
think we enjoyed it better and had better times than they do nowadays. At least we appreciated what we had, and nowadays it's gotten to be pretty good if they remark about it. It's gotten to be pretty good or they call it lousy. In our time there wasn't anything lousy; everything was fine, no matter what it was, it was something different.
SS: Well, did you, as a young man, before you were married, did you work with your father in the--
FW: No, I---?--- help on the farm, but he had his small farm and three boys. When we grew up, there was quite a lot of livestock in the country at that time and a country boy in them days kind of lived for the day
when he'd get big enough to have a pony and drive somebody's cows, you know or even herd sheep. That's kind of the way they grew up. Then there was the demand for that, for boys of that kind. They could
12

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
get jobs on different ranches around and take care of the livestock, either sheep or cattle. In fact there was nothing else, whatever you--if you didn't do
something like that you'd have to go clear out of the country, you know. The boys that were raised out in the country, that's their lives; that's what they want to do. They had very poor schools, short school periods. As soon as you were big enough to do anything else you did it, you know. Later on, of course, then they went out to high school, and as time goes on, now we have a bus and whatnot, a little more or less like home people.
SS: Well, how old were you when you got your first job? FW: Oh, I think I was about 15. I don't recall exactly,
but about that.
ss: Who was it with? Was it at one of the ranches?
FW: No, it was a fellow by the name of Robinson up at
Fremont that's near Loa. I had a job there one summer on his ranch, but I started pretty early there with livestock. When I got out of what little school I had then--I was rather, you might say, a pretty husky lad for my age, or a good lot of them. Boys at fifteen years old nowadays seem 1ike they don't have any responsibility. When I was that old I was freighting with four horses, from what we call down in the cross
13

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
high ground to Green River which would take two weeks to make the trip. Well, a boy fifteen nowadays, they wouldn't consider even making that kind of a trip. They carried mail, horseback in the country. Boys would actually stretch their age a little in order to get the job, like you were supposed to be 16 years
old, but if he was big enough, then he would say he was 16 and he'd get the job. He would ride from here to Green River in a day, and to Hite. My brother-in- law turned out to be the better--when he was a young fellow he did that, he stretched his age a little and got that job, and he rode the mail for years. If we had anybody now that would ride a horse from here to Hite in a day, he would be in the paper and so would the horse's picture, and everything else, but that was a common everyday occurrence, one day down and another day back. Well, that carried on for years. But now, I was just mentioning here, if somebody came in now and said they drove a horse from Green River over here, they'd want a picture of him and the horse and have a lot of details. It was just a common thing in those days. All of us did it, never thought a thing about it, we were so anxious to get to do it
then.
SS: You must have had some pretty good sturdy horses,
14

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER what kind of stock?
FW: Well, they were no particular breed I don't think, just ordinary what we call saddle horses. Some of them were 1ike horses today, but the breed didn't necessarily mean--some of them were those little old Indian ponies, you might say; they were a good deal smaller horses than they are today. Now that's 65 miles from here to Hite, and they way the trail would go it was more than that by wagon road, but by going horseback you could make a few shortcuts that you wouldn't be able to do in a wagon. Well, I don't want to do that today, and there's no one else that does. If he did, it'd be a story like you see in one of Butch Cassidy's books.
SS: Yeah, probably what would happen is if you tried to use the roadway that's there now you'd get run over by a car anyway. Did the trail more or less follow the highway that's here now that goes down to Hite?
FW: No, well, in a general direction, yeah, but like I say, there were places that you could make shortcuts, you know, that you wouldn't be able to do with a wagon, but it pretty well did. Of course there were exceptions, like we used to go down what was called Trachyte Canyon, the place at the North---?--- and they didn't have a wagon road down in Trachyte
15

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
canyon. You could kind of go off to go down that canyon which made it a little closer, I think.
SS: Was there good water along the way, or did you have to carry--?
FW:
There was water at East Canyons and there was a ranch out here about 17 miles where there was a trail that went by that you could get drinking water at, but water wasn't a consideration. I doubt if the mail carriers carried water, it would be 17 miles from here out to that ranch, I really don't know about that. I'd be surprised if somebody said that they did carry water, because I've ridden horseback all my life and very few days did we ever take water, and we'd be riding around here on the desert looking for cattle. So there's a lot longer time of water than a straight route straight through there, so I would doubt very much that they'd carry any water.
But nowadays, they have their little canteens.
I don't know. That desert when you're driving up to Green River looks awful big and awful empty. I guess it isn't once you know it and you've been over it,
IW: SS:
you know, what's there and what to expect.
FW: I'll say. A fellow on a little old pony out there on
one of those ridges looks pretty small.
SS: Well, let's see, you talked about driving freight
16

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
wagon and you had a job over near Bicknell--that's not where you said though, is it?
Fremont.
Fremont. When did you continue? Why don't you just tell me then what you did, and what you started doing to earn your livlihood after you were married and so
FW: SS:
FW:
forth?
Well, I worked with he livestock, especially sheep, after I was married and prior to getting married. Before I got married I sold them, and then after we were married I was with the sheep for about 25 years and I didn't do anything else.
Well, now, where did you get these sheep, did you get them--?
Just working---?---
I was going to ask you, I noticed there are--the land is divided up into big ranches in this area; there are a number of big ranches around. But in those days, was it cattle that belonged to those ranches that--?
SS:
FW: SS:
FW: Well, the north ---?--- was tied to the Bureau of Land Management or the Taylor Grazing Act. It was all open, and there were a good many transient people. It's quite a country for--it's quite a winter range for both sheep and cattle, both. There so many would
17

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
come in here out of the country with cattle or sheep.
IW: Even over around Ferron and---?--- they bring in the sheep in the winter.
FW: Then after the Taylor Grazing Law became effective, then it came to be divided up among the stockrnen who were located in here. That was the perfect way to keep transients out. We have several fairly large outfits in this country, and of course they've got their first holding which they all still have, it's
IW:
just been handed down. After some of those outfits, I think I got the ranch here, and it was not so terribly long after we were married was it? We still have it and run a few cattle here.
It was in the thirties, I don't know what year for
sure.
SS: Well, you know, thinking about--well, I think you
said you were married in '25? FW: Yeah.
SS: Well, I imagine then, you must have had quite a struggle like everybody else, and you were trying to get established when, not long after the Depression and before the Depression. Was this country, this
particular area hard hit by the Depression, the
people here?
FW: Well, yes. Well, actually it wasn't any worse in
18

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
comparison anywhere, only it was that there were such few jobs and they were jobs that didn't demand such very high wages. Farming and stockraising have been the poorest wages throughout history, and for that reason it was pretty tough going. I might mention, when our girls got old enough to go to high school-- of course that was a little later on, but we had one daughter, the oldest one was a year ahead of the other one in high school, and then the next year they were both in high school and had to leave. Anyway, the year that they were both in high school, I was working for $45.00 a month, during that Depression. And even at that I was making more than some of them because I had been on the job for a long while.
The boys up here at the QC camp only got $30.00.
IW:
FW: It was a higher wage than what was paid for in doing
the livestock.
SS: What did the average cowboy, you know, just the
somebody average working the cattle get paid?
FW: Well, during that particular time that I mentioned, the average wage was about $30.00 or $35.00. $10.00
in those days seemed 1ike an awful raise, far and
above what you--
SS: It bought a lot more groceries than $10.00 will
today.
19

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
IW: But you had, when we were first married you got a
hundred dollars a month.
FW: Well, yeah, but--yeah. That was not during the
Depression. But as a whole, the people have had, we'd say a pretty hard time to eke out an existence because our irrigation water has constantly been a big expense. Ever since the valley was settled they've, the old timer's would put in a dam and it would go out and then they'd dredge another one and it would go out. Some would be discouraged and leave and others--
IW: But there wasn't much cash involved in those other dams, they used logs and things like that. Of course it wasn't so deep then. They'd just make the dam out of logs and it wasn't a whole lot of expense, really. But now we've had these financially--
FW: Ever since the valley was settled they've had trouble holding up the dam and the ditches and whatnot. You see these big washes like one right here now; it kind of comes together when it gets wet.
SS: Now tell me about those years that there was all that sheep raising going on. You said that you must have worked for other outfits that wanted to bring sheep in here. The sheep industry here is a thing of the past now, isn't it?
20

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
FW: Well, so to speak. We still have a few bands, one or
ss:
FW:
two on this area out here, where there used to be ever so many, maybe as many as thirty herds of sheep, and in those days they ran ever so many more in a band than they do nowadays. Three thousand sheep in those days no one considered a big herd, and now there aren't that many sheep in the area.
How many men did it take to take care of a herd that size?
Well, ordinarily two, but during lambing time--of course, it depends on where you lamb, some lamb in the shed and some lamb on the range. On the range it required a good deal more help for a period of thirty days, or twenty days. Two men would take care of that many sheep for pretty much all of that time.
When you'd go out you'd have maybe a partner with you and you'd just then--how long would you be gone away from home then?
Well, ordinarily you would be within a day's ride of home, you know. Or in some areas, we've known, say like these transient fellows that come in, what we'd call "under the ledge," that's the country down next to the Colorado River.
SS:
FW:
ss: Where is that? I have heard people talk about going under the ledge to the sheep, and at first I thought-
21

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
-I just didn't know what it meant.
FW: "Under the ledge" is a big area over around the Colorado River, it's just a big area over in there. It's beyond this flat desert country here, in fact, it's all east of the Dirty Devil River between the Dirty Devil River and the Colorado River. Those boys from up around Price or what we call Sanpete, or Ferron and Castle Dale and in that country. it wasn't common for them to come down in the fall and stay with the sheep until the spring, but it wasn't uncommon either. A good many of them did it. They'd come down here and spend all winter with the sheep and then go back in the spring.
IW: ---?--- they'd come to town and get their supplies-- -?---
FW:
They'd bring the supplies in, and one of the men from the herd would meet a truck thirty days away. We fellows that worked with sheep around here, in the wintertime we would be able to get home--oh, you might say a person would be safe in saying maybe once a month. During summer, of course when we were out, we'd usually take turns and one of us would be able to come home for the Fourth of July and the other on
the 24th, you know. But it was pretty well tied down, a good deal different than the way it is nowadays, a
22

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
five day week, and eight hour days.
SS: Well, now just your own preference, which did you prefer working with, the cattle or sheep?
FW: Well, as far as the work is concerned, I'd sooner work with the cattle, but the sheep pay more money. For that reason, I guess I'd say I like it better.
SS: Well, now, do you think the sheep hurt this country? FW: Well, now I wouldn't know how to answer that. Maybe, because we don't have anywhere near the livestock here that we used to have. Actually, I think it's the
---?--- condition other than the grazing in the fall. Just drought and--of course we all realize that our country's wide open and anybody can go into it. In a year that's what we would call good--well, we realized that everybody would flock to it because it was sort of a spot that, in a location that the climate and so on, it was a good winter range. For that reason it was quite desirous; people liked to come here for some reason. I think that they overdid it to some extent, but I don't think that's what brought about all of this change. Now we're not supporting--oh, I don't know just what percentage, but a very small percent of the livestock that this area here supports compared to what it did in those days. Under the supervision of the Bureau of Land
23

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
Management I don't actually see any difference. It's been so many years that I 've been here, I 'm in the
livestock business myself. We have some ---?--- I
think it's as I said before---?--- conditions.
ss: Well, what troubles were, what kind of problems did you have with the sheep and cattle? Do you have
predators in this area?
FW: Well, not a great deal, but during the time I worked
with the sheep and livestock they don't seem to bother the cattle, very little, if any. That was quite a problem with the sheep in those days, it was a major problem. They killed lots of livestock, lots of sheep, and they did quite a lot of damage, but in later years they had a program that sort of did away with it. Now it's slacked off and the sheep are protected a little. They'll eventually, I think, get back, but maybe they won't let 'em go until they're out of control like they were before. There are more; the sheepmen are starting to complain a little more for a year now. The last ten or fifteen years they had pretty much their own way. Now they have to keep a little closer track of them, you know, and that's
more expense, and the loss is more, too.
SS: What about disease, epidemics with the livestock,
have you had any?

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
FW: Well, no, not in this area. We have so little in this
area. We have a weed that grows in this country, or plant, it's called "loco" that has done more or less damage from time to time. But other than that, I don't--oh, we have several things that are bizarre, but then it really don't amount to a great lot either, like alkalis and things like that, and mud
that might take a critter now and then, but it's not
serious.
IW: Well, you can get a little ---?--- for things now
that they didn't used to.
FW: But the loco business used to serious and still is
from time to time in this country. It's quite a
problem.
SS: How about losing cattle or sheep to rustlers? This
looks like such a big country to me, it must be awfully hard if somebody did want to come and make off with the sheep now and then, it looks like it'd be awfully hard to catch them.
FW: Well, you never know. You know, you hear some complaints about one might miss a few cattle or a critter every now and then, (but it] wouldn't necessarily mean that somebody had took off with it, and it doesn't necessarily mean that it went any other way, either. It could have gone that way. But
25

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
generally speaking, I think that there's very little of it in this country, nothing in comparison with what we have out--gee, they go right inside the farms and take them and in the yard and on summer ranges and things. You read about it all the time and I even have known of one person in particular was killed rustling cattle. We don't have, I'd say very little of it, as far as I know, not any of it, but I wouldn't be surprised. It's pretty near sure a thing that every now and then that would be the case, because we have pretty near every kind of people travelling this road as there is anywhere else. I'd say up to now there's been very little, if any. There wouldn't be--
It hasn't been a big worry?
No.
They've had a few killed by cars on the highway.
Oh, that's been quite a--
But they're getting some of the roads fenced now. Mr.
ss: FW: IW: FW: IW:
FW: SS:
FW:
Hyde over at---?--- lost quite a few, what would you say, fifty or sixty?
Quite a number.
Well, it's a real problem when you have open range and cars travelling at the speeds that they do now. Yes, it's actually hard to avoid an accident of that
26

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
kind. In fact, it's just about out of the question, isn't it? Especially at night.
SS: Well, a good way to avoid it, which is a way people won't do, is to slow down.
FW: Well, in some cases you don't have time, especially at night, you're driving along and you don't just stop at sixty miles an hour.
IW: We hit one coming down just above the road out of the dugway there. Just all of a sudden here this black bull came out in front of us and we couldn't turn out because there was a ravine on each side. We crashed but it didn't kill us, it just mashed our car a little.
ss: I was going to say, what did it do to your car? I mean those things are usually bad accidents.
FW: Oh, yeah.
SS: IW:
SS:
You get hurt quite often when you hit the stock.
It was a very strong wind, and we were coming home from---?---.
One of the worst frights I've ever had in my life was last summer. I had an interview down on the
reservation and I was coming home pretty late at night, I was going back to Blanding. I was driving along at--I must have been driving 60, 65, maybe, but you know how that road is, it's just nothing,
27

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
certainly no other cars on the road. All of a sudden this bid old black mule jumped out of the darkness onto the road, and oh, I was scared to death. I thought my heart was going to stop. I didn't hit him, I don't know just exactly how we managed to miss each other, but we did.
We've had quite a loss from the--especially between here and Green River, not so much out this way, but on this Green River road. There've been a number of cattle killed, but no serious accidents. There've been quite a few cars totalled out, but--
People have made out pretty good?
People have got out of it fairly lucky.
There were a couple of fellows killed out here, but I don't think they ran into animals, did they?
Well, that would be very few, insofar as I know-- well, and the amount of accidents, too. There've been several accidents caused by livestock.
Let's see now, you were talking about this being an area that people would bring in a lot of stock for winter ranges and especially good years and so forth. Has this operated as a disadvantage to you as far as the market? When there'd be a good year would your local market be damaged because so many people would try to come in and sell out at the same time?
FW:

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
FW: Well, we have no local markets. There hasn't ever
been a 1ocal market here; we've a1ways had to take
our livestock out.
IW: Have to drive 'em--
FW: No, that hasn't had any effect on the market of the
livestock.
SS: Where do you sell you cattle?
FW: Well, we have an auction yard in Salina and one in
Richfield and we usually go, but we have gone to
Grand Junction quite a lot, but late years--
SS: Do you trail them in or do you--
FW: Truck.
SS: Truck them, uh-huh. What breed seems to do well in
this country?
FW: Well, they've got Hereford cattle mostly in this
country. I think maybe their breeds would probably do equally as well, but then I think the trend throughout the years was Hereford cattle, while lately there are some of these Black Angus cattle and they seem to do well. As far as I know they all get along about the same.
ss: Have you had trouble with the wild horses and cattle mixing in with your good stock?
FW: Well, that might have been the case in the early, back years ago with horses, you could have. It's
29

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
possible that some have lost horses that they were using on account of wild horses, you know, mixing in with them and straying away. We don't have any wild horses anymore.
IW: They're all gone.
FW: They're all gone. There used to be an awful lot of
wild horses in this country, but since the Bureau of Land Management has taken over they've gotten rid of them.
SS: Were they just a nuisance or were they of any value? FW: Well, they were some, the usual beautiful animals, we'd catch them and use them all right, but there
were just so awful many of them that they were just
taking [over] the country.
SS: What did they do, did they just have a hunt and kill
them off?
FW: Well, they chased them, the big riding clubs finally
wound up cleaning them up. You go a long ways now before you see wild horses. You could get 40 men out of Springville or anywhere else to come out here now if you tell them about two wild horses. They have them riding clubs, that's a big deal now for them, you know. But when they first started to chase them, you know, I think the ranchers and the stockmen, they sort of wanted to get rid of them, you know, and
30

 IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
they'd catch what they could and take them out. I guess some of them were killed, but not very many. They'd catch them and so on.
SS: FW:
SS:
FW:
I guess there was a market for them.
Well, you can get a little something out of them. They were never very hard to catch.
Have there been any experiments with other types of
livestock that you particularly remember, like goats? Well, years ago here there were goatherders in the country, and I know they did all right, but there haven't been any for quite some time. We had quite a few buffalo, but they were I guess the only place on earth, or in the United States now, that there are herds of buffalo on the public domain.
Where are they?
They're here in the Henry Mountains. I guess the only herd in existence in public domain now out on the range.
What other--I'm sure there must be deer.
Oh, yeah, there are more or less deer in the mountains.
What about elk?
Well, not so much in this area here in the Henry Mountain area. We do have a lot of elk in the Fishlake Mountains and in this area back of us here.

  IDA M. WEBER AND FORD WEBER
Right in back of us in this immediate area, I think there'd be a few in the Henry Mountains but very few. They've brought a few in at times and tried to start them here, but they haven't had much luck. However there are a few, I think, left. Even a few antelope; we had a few antelope here, they started them again. How about bighorn sheep?
Well, there are a few of those left. They haven't been brought in; they're just remnants of the old
ones. But they're very scarce. You don't hear of them very much. Possibly some of them might be found under the--what do you call it? "Under the ledge," but they're very uncommon, you see. But antelope are not, there are more or less antelope. We have quite a lot of antelope.
SS: Well, you were talking, you mentioned Taylor Grazing and BLM and so forth did cut out the transient herds or--
FW: Well, yeah, they just mostly eliminated that there on account of--in order to apply for a permit--
