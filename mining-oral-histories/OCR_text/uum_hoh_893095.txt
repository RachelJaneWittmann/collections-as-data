L

Joined the armed fo r c e s in what year?

GA In '43. I guess.

L

Did you join in Bingham. Did they have a recruiting office there.

GA I didn't join. I was drafted. But I remember i t was in Midvale

where the office was.

EA How did you get down.

GA I think we took a bus. EA You had no transportation.

GA No. (chuckles) I think it was a bus that we had then.

L

Were you ready to be drafted.

GA I was old. I was 18. They just waited til I turned almost.

I turned 18 in February, they let me finish that year of

-- you know, that year's class.

L

But were you ready inwardly.

GA Yeah, Ithink if I hadn't of gone into any school, I'd of probably

gone in sooner. At that time, eerybody's going. That's - it's

--there's a big difference. All your friends are going. Except

that I was always thinking like everybody else. I wanted to join

the Navy or the Air Force. You know, not this army stuff.

And it was really hard, if you weren't a citizen, to join anything.

Actually, the army's the mly place where they - where you can go.

They draft you for it.

L

so you went. Andyou weren't naturalized then.

GA No. (not naturalized). You can't be naturalized utnil youre 21.

OHI Esperanza y Gavino Aguayo 3-4-85 sl:2

L

Couldn't youget naturalized through your parents?

GA Our parentsw~re not citizen.

L

So what happened to you. Where did you go to boot camp?

GA CAmp Roberts. Outside - where was it. I guess

must have been about the big town around there.

Somewhere there. I remember open wheat fields. Is what it was.

In the summer, I can just remember them being hot. Just about

as hot as_ any~hi_!:19 yo~_ can see in the desert, I think. Those

old wheat fields.

L

How long were you thre.

GA I think it must have been about 6 weeks, 9 weeks.

EA Did youg~ith Raymond?

GA No, I went before. No--Raymond - Well, Raymond joined. He's

another one - he joined the Navy. But he graduated. I think.

So he waited til next year. Because he graduated. I think -

I forget about when we shipped out. About August. Sometime.

I think.

L

Where did you go.

GA Made one ship trip and landed in Caladonia. In

Caladonia.

A whole ship load. That must have been about 7 or 8,000. And

then from there, they would just join

and shipped us out

_ t_o different - -=-. _I joined my division in New Zealand. That's

L

My God, you were half way around the world.

GA _ Oh, that's a long ways out. We made it in good time. I think it

only took us about 11 days. On one ship. We didn't have no (laughs)

OHI Esperanza y Gavino Aguayo 3-4-85 sl:3

convoy

thats - you think about - at that time, you were

reading about convoys that were going across the North Atlantic.

Big Convoys and everything and submarine attacks and all that.

And here we are in one ship, by ourselves. You know, going down ..

(laughs) But it was a big ship. It was a - one of these regular

passenger lines. General Pope (laughs) I remember General Pope.

They c1aimed it was faster than a submarine so it didn't have

to - it didn't - they didn't need a convoy. (laughs)

Oh, When we spent all that time, we never, except for one time,

I think about a spot of rocks, somewhere out in the middle of

theocean. Never saw a speck of land until we hit Caladonia.

L

what happened there.

GA What I can remember mostly about that is about a month after we

were there, we hit a typhoon there and we were all living in

these big, like hospital tents, you know, about maybe 50 or 60

people in a tent. And that typhoon just wiped those whole tents

right off. It swept them away I've never seen anything like

that. I never had the slightest idea of what a typhoon was.

You know, like that. And we were rightoutside the capitol -

and I remember they had these old - like - just like French

village. Well, .it's a French island. Their homes werelike-

that - you know, with a red tile roofs. And I remember watching

those red tiles sailing across - for like - what do you call

it. Frisbees? (laughs) But it--We spent time trying to save our

tent. You know, holding the ropes and this and that, trying to

OHI Esperanza y Gavina Aguayo 3-4-85 sl:4

keep them going down. You know, and the smart ones, I guess, the

ones - they collapsed them --

L

Put them right01 the ground.

GA Put them right on the ground. They saved their equipment. We lost

eerything we had. Trying to save them. Ripped - the poles, the

tents, and everything like that.

That was a nice island. A lot bigger than what I had thought

islands would be. I thought every island was - like the kind we

read - Guadecanal, Coconut Island. That was a big island.

Mountains. And all the people. It was really a big island.

But that's all -- that was just a staging area. They bring you

tlE ·re and then ibey decide fromthere where to ship you. I joined

my division in New Zealand.

That was a nice country. That

was a pretty country. I thought they were a little backwards.

In aiot of ways. But. Real Pretty_country. All farms. Farm-

type. Sheep. And cattle. But all green, you know. and all

prosperous looking, yo \know. That's what I can remember most

about that country there.

L

Did you see any action from there. Did you

GA From there we went to New Guineau. That was my first action, in

New Guinea.

L

What happened to you.

GA Well, I don't know if you've ever seen pictures of New Guinea

on the map or something like that. But, that's an island

must be close to 800-1000 miles long. You know. And I don't know

about how wide, maybe, 3 or 4 00 miles. It's a long island. A

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 sl:5

big one. And when they first started to take it. And you didn't

really ·land on any place. I remember the Japanese were holding

La

and Salamoa, that was about right across the bay - the

·straits, a little ocean, from Australia. That's about as far south as it got. Right there. And when we landed, we landed

maybe about 500 miles around them. Up the coast from them.

That ~.s about .the way we fought the war in the Pacific. They just

by-pass, land o-n some ·other place so they were--s--and then try to starve everyting in between and hold their positions. And that's about it. We landed there. And I remember the l ~emember the 41st landed about, oh,maybe 400-500 miles up from us, at

Olandia. Yeah. So there really asn't anybody that our division

that

. There was maybe 4 or 500 miles north of us or

west, whichever way that island faces, they were up the coast

from us. And then1here wasn't nob~dy south of us. So all you

do is sit - and in between you hold thep::,sition and then you

try to chase everybody away from it. They just - you just

the idea you just starve them to death.

Is all they were

doing. Except for - oh, about the first month or so, when

they - when they tried to take us out, like attack you there--

after that all there was was patrol work. A--

L

You mean, the Japanese tried to move you out.

GA Yeah.

L

What did they do?

GA They were only about the first mnth. When we landed, it wasn't

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 sl:6

much. It wasn't nothing. We had time. We went in. We dug in.

And there was a river down about - down the coast from us.

there. they ome out across the--

try to come out across the river, oh, for about 3 or 4 days, but

they (laughs) The japanese were good fighters. They were no

dummy - I think by that that time, they were getting desperate.

They come acrossthe river, they just got cut up, they just--

they couldn't make- it.

After that, it was just a matter of patroling and going you know

just to see how far back they would pull back and~eing what

they were doing. And everything else like that. I remember one

time, we went - ah, and took a patrol. I wasi.n reconnasaince.

We used to call it

it's intelligence and

reconassaince and i- thereas about maybe 20 or 30 of us in the

platoon. I rememberone time, they split us up, about ten in

each group. There were two australians in each group and about

ten or twelve of us. And we had about 15 police boys.

And thre must have been about 100 native porters who - god, we

looked like one of those safaris inthe movies. We had one group

to going down be beach, another group, the one I was in, went

inland and went down the mountain. Parallel to the coast.

-Just - the idea of seeing how far down - if there was any main

concentrations of toops left, then how far down they went.

We went down for about maybe 2 weeks. I don't know how far

we went, I doubt if it was 20 miles. (laughs) You don't -

you don't walk that fast. Until - until we met some more

resistance. Ah. Then, I don't know. We just come out.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 sl:7

We hit another little river. And we come back out. We lost

no man as I remember out of our group. We rejoined the

other group down at the teach. It got a little hard. They

started - tried to infiltrate us at night. And they pulled

our platoon out. - And brought in our division of recon company.

And our rifle company and they stood there for awhile. They

had a ltitle more trouble there. But that's about all the kind

of fight we had. So - you go until you meet somebody. And if

they got too strong, you called in -you calledin -- but they

were in a bad way, the Japanese. They were starving. The navy

already controlled the ocean around, they wouldn't get supplies.

SO it was just a matterof leaving them there. They never did

land anymore troops below us. And

in Sa- - - -

They finally took that one when they decided to take that,

they landed - they took where the'main parts of the Japanese

was. But up to everything that was in between - or between us

and Orlandia, they just left.

L

How didyou react to being in the army. Being in a war.

GA

I don't think you react to anything. It's just part - of

what we were supposed to do. It wasn't nothing - I think

we just all looked upon it as something that we were going

to do the best as we could. I always did. And I never seen

nothing - I don't know what you call it - that it was something

that you had to get out of or not. If it - it wasn't - it was
just something I · think that we believed in·.-what ··.we ,were doing.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 sl:8

L

Yeah I understand. But how did you react to fighting and people

dying.

GA I think - I think actually the first time, I think because of the

way it happened, you don't really react much. The first time, I

was in a fire fight, Ididn't really see who I was shooting at.

I mean, we were shooting at groups running back and forth And

you don't really get a chance to go over and look at them.You

don't see that. I don't know how it would be if right off

the bat, you went - maybe one on the one. You know. Ithink

thatwould kind of make you feel bad because some of them

ah - it'd make them a little sick. But when it happens in a big

fire fight, ah, it's mostly - when you're shooting at bunches.

You're single and everybody's shooting. You don't really see

- you really can't claim that you got that one, or something

like, you know, you really don't' see that.

L

You don't know who you're hitting.

GA You don't know who you're hitting. And you're too busy. You don't

really see it. If it had happened the first time, like I say,

one on one, it might have been different. But. - Then, by

that time, I think ou get used to it. It's ah it isn't something--

I think you just sort of feel a twinge, is about all. You know.

I think - I remember the first time, it really hurt - not hurt

but a little - I hated to do something - but actually I thought

it was maybe for thebest. We went up on against ?ne time, a

Japanese outside a cave, and he was in real bad shape. He

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 sl:9

had something like - what, I've seen pictures - and it must

be something like elephantitis. Have you ever seen pictures

of that.

L

That's a strange looking disease.

GA With his legs -- I mean, you don't

end side one begin side two

We found him outside of it. He's probably the only one that

couldn't get <llt. The mher ones, we think were in the cave.

L

They were hiding you mean.

GA Yeah, they were in there, I'm pretty sure. They were in there

hiding. All around there, you could see where - you know, that they'd been there. He - he was the only one that didn't get

back, or couldn't carry. But he couldn't - he was bad. And he pointed to us to kill him. And, we lookedat him for awhile.

And I finally did. And that kind of - (long pause)
I think that kind a hurt a bit. (painful)

L

It hurts even thinking about it today.

GA Yeah. I don't think I remembered it. But even at that time,

though I didn't really feel, what ., bad. I kind of felt sorry. But I don't know what I could have done with him

though. EA What did youget your medal for?

GA OH, that was just a fire fight. That wasn't a--

EA He did get a medal.

0Hr
E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s2:10

GA

No, this was a lot later in the Phillipines. Ah. At that

time, we were getting about the first relief. It ~s close

to the end of the war. I think it was about maybe May - I

think right before the war in Europe ended. And we were in

L

on. And we had it pretty well. Pretty well settled.

I remember at that time, everybody-they had what they called

points, at that time. You could go home, so many points.

So many months and that, you could go home. So, we were

losing people all that time. Andwe were getting new ones.

Ah, about the first real batch of recruits that we had in

--new - new peo'j>le. And I had - our platoon was. I would

say about 3/4's new. And we were taking them out on patrol

with us, trying to getthem ready. Because we knew we were

going to Japan. And I had -Iwas out on patrol. One night

I had the platoon. AndI had this bunch of (laughs) - I thought

they were kids. I think I was only 20 myself. But they wre

they sure - they were - they didn't have no idea of what they

going into. You try and take them out on patrol. You try to

teach them .Anq they didn't have the slightest idea. I remember

we were runnig what we call security patrol. And. I was

attached to regimental headquarters, so we were a littl ebit

-ha.ck. You~ e- not -Oll:-__!.he line._ You know. You - We run security

patrol aroundthe company. We were sitting up on top of a hill

and you run them down in the canyons and down the. gulley to make

sure there wasn't nothing there. So that they _could come up

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s 2 :ll
at night, you know, just - j ust - be securit y . I took one out one day. About oh maybe ten - of these n ew people . And they were pretty good going out in the morning. And t he n we were coming back, and all we had to do was climb back up t op o f the hill to where - to our camp. On top. And they sta rted getting real relaxed. Joking and walking a::-ound. I kept trying to -you know, I couldn't even separate them.They had their little groups you know walking up there, just goingback up there. And they started scaring me. Because I didn't want to be with them, making al'l that noise. And then they were' tpaying attention. SO we were going up one gully, like that, so I left them. I went over to the next gully. I figured, well, if they'renot looking, maybe I can look over there. And I was going up this gully. And I remember looking down across them, they were comingup. Walking and ~lking.Just fooling around. And I happened to look down this gully. (laughs) And th.ere were about 5 or 6 - I think 6 Japanese in there. You know, they weren't doing nothing. I think bey would have let us go by. becuase I could see them, you know, they were undecided like what to do. Theycouldn't figure. But all their attention was over here on this bunch, _coming -up, -t}l.e_y-we~ making all the noise. You know, see, that's what they were doing. But I couldn't take the chance. I opened fireon them. (laughs) And I started yelling to the other guys - to get busy, to do something. Lay down or something you know. I stood- I - I -I shot I did my clip at them. By t h at time, the other ones came across and they finall y wok e up.

OHI E&A Aguayo 3-4-85 s2:12
They were only about a hundredmi.les away from them, on the other side. We- we got two alive. But I got a medal for that. But it was just a dumb -- if I had had aregular platoon, (laughs) we maybe wouldn't have seen them then, I don't know. Like I said. they- they didn't seem to be doing-- I had an idea that if I
hadn't opened fire, they would havelet them go. because I don't think they wanted to be caught. You know, they - they but I really coldn't take the chance.
L sure.
Sure. GA But that was a bad time there · .There . .We had some new kids.
I'm just glad we didnt' really have to land on Japan. When I joined my platoon you know, I was a young - I was theonly young one on at the time. And that's about the way you used to come in, one - two at a time. You alwyas had old people in - people to show you, to take the brunt of it until you learned. And I remrnernber the Phillipines, when they started sending the olde ::ipeople home, we got left with alot of men - and some of them were real smaries. That's what I could see-- I think by that time, we started to get some of the ones that for awhile, because we got a lot of ROTC. They were - they were olderthan I was and I don't think they liked the idea--maybe not liked, but they - they thought they knew it. I think like you know, like the6g~g all over. I think the-thought they knew it. I think we'd have been a day way if we had had to land in Japan with them.I'm just glad we didn't.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s2:13

When we come from be ship and the

was there and I seen

the Japanese had, ohhh, I don't think I'da want to land on that island.

L

··· what do you take from be war - now that the war's gone -

what did you learn from that ..

About who you are and what' it's like to be alive.

GA I dn't think--- what you get back is a lot of confidence, I

think. I don't think there's anything thatcan really happen

that - where you really have to put out as much as you did

thre. You know, and you- I think - it gives you confidence for

the rest of your life.There isn't anything that, I don't think,

that can hurt me. You know. There was-- I don't think--there

isn't anything more important than your life, I don't think.

YEt ther's a lot more important t~an your life in the way that

you put it down, for something you believe. Ah, it was - to

me, coming out alive was a big experience. Now, if you don't

make it, then I don't think nothing can make up for it. But,

it's something you can't duplicate. Anything else, I - I just

don't see anything -

L

You had a powerful experience.

GA I think I come away with the idea that men - they'recapable

of doing alot. You know, they - they're alot strong than what

they look. They're - they take more punishment than you think

that a mn can take. It's - I think it gives you a lot of re-

spect for people. I met alot of people over there that you

probablyfu.ink. Well, you've seen the movies the Japanese-- little

apes up on trees, you know. They - they weren't nothing. But if they

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s2:14

had had our equipment, you know, they -boy, I don't know - they were good soldiers. I thought a little dumb. Not dumb. But just

the way they - like their attacks when everything was done. In the way they'd come at you when there wasn't no sense to it. That

I think was dumb. When they decided to stay intheir holes, boy, then they were rough to get out. They were hard. They wouldn't

come out. They wouldn't come out.

L

Mmm.

GA I don't really know. I think the more.

proably

the biggest experience - the biggest thing that's ever happened

to me and like I said, if you come back, it's all right. I guess.

It's all right.· There'll never be nothing like it. And t:> JlI\e

I think it was good. I learned an awful lot. Like I think I mentioned before~ I think.....it taught me that - well, ther' s nobdy better, there's nothing - there's nobody thatsany better

than you. You went through an experience. That nobody else has gone through, you know. And there's very few ·.·.. I - I · ..... I think you learn alot about people. I - I try to explain .- to people about what I thought about the PhiB,ipino people-the way they suffered, the way they stood up to it. I've always admired them for that. I've always admired the Japanese for the

way they could takelosing. I don't kno:w whether we could, like that. And)et_behave so - I don'I know what - how_you'd call it. The

way they never bothered us. You know, when we landed in Japan . We \-s re already .loading on· ships when · _..., when 1hey declared

peace. So we just kept - we just kept going. So we landed in Japan

pretty soon after the way, after they declared the peace, because we were just about ready. Becuase I know we - we had our -- all

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s2:15

our maps, our equipment, loaded. A--Everything ready to go. we

knew where we were going to go. My division~s supposed tohave

landed on - umm, it wasn't Honshoi, it was - that island south

of Honshu. But taht's where we were supposed to go. We had all

the maps and everything where we were supposed to go. And then--

and yet, when we landed, all the people - I remember, when we

got off, they landed in Yokohama. And you took

a convoy.

A.Qd - my platoon, we - our job was supposed to go somewhere to

an airport, it was like - ah, What's Colorado Springs - like a

naval, not a naval, like a

training station. Something

they call Colorado SPrings Air Free Academy. Something like

that. Anyway, we got out of the ship, got into our jeeps, we

head down this road. People standing on the streetslooking at

us. Nobdoy bothering us. We looked up at thebuilaings. Pe

People just watching us pass. They never - never said a word.

Never bothered us. To them, I think when they told them that the
war was over, ·r think that was it. There was no - no words--

I just don'tknow how to describe±. It was just --I think we

were more afraid of them at that time than they were of us. When

we went to that airport, here we were about 12 men - we picked

out a hangar and we went in the hangars. We pickedout a little

Gorrrer-of the-c-room- and rtlon't think-we wved fromthat little

corner for 2 days until we got relief. We didn't even go outside

that hangar to see what was goingon. And yet we were supposed to

have been occupying that - that - base. That was ours. (alughs)

And I remember watching soldiers all over theplace. · They never

OHI E&G Aguayo s2:16

bothered us. They just -

L

They just accepted it totally.

GA That was it. I think the emperor told them that that was it. And

that was it. It was funny. I don'tknow of anybody else (laughs)

any otherpeople that wouldbehave like that, really.

L

Itis incredible.

GA I think so. And I imagine there were alot of others - maybe

others were bigger force, but I know our little assignment

was ridiculous. We didnt have anything. What we going to do

by ourselves up inthat little - you know - I don't really know

how many thousands of soldiers there was but there was a regular

air force base. Somekind of a training, you know. And yet,

we didn't even go out for water. We used the water that we

brought with us. We just

end side two

begin side three

I remember going through one of those - when we were there~ We

Went to N~~~~- Ocean, Nagasaki, the second one. That City,

there. The only thing I can remember there was the chimney standing

and everything else just rubble, just rubble, just

....The second city they bombed on. There was nothing on there. But parts Of To kyothat lo·okedt h e same way - fire bombed. I think

they done as much except it probably took them more time. But

Japan, especially at that time, their cities were real tinder

box types. You know, old wooden house types. You know, things

like that. I think fire bombs should have done a lot of damage

OHI E&G Agua yo s3:17 3-4- 85

to them. I remember going through other places. They really

hadn't used the atom bomb, they looked a lot t he same. Theonly

thing I can remember, the round chimney , I guess from t he factories,

they seemed to have stand up. I alway s said t o my sel f , n ext t i me,

I'm going to find me a chimney and that's where I'm going to sit .

Inside the chimney, because that'swhat seems to hold. (laughs )

L

You were through quite a bit, my God.

GA I don't think it was really that much - I was never in a rifle

company. Rifle ,company, I thought, used to have it bad. Our

rifle company, to me To me, that was a hard day's work up there.

our platoon was, like I said, mostly patrol work. We= All we had

to do, if youcouldkeep from running into something real bad,

all we had to do was find them, then run back. Then the rifle

company would come, they'd send the artillary out, they'd send

something else to go up there.All you had to do was find something.

That's about all. So - I always though twhat you'd call a regular

infantry, a rifle company is what I call them. Now, I thought

they had it rough. Now, they didn'thave no way - if they told

us to go to here, we had our way - we'd go over here, over there,

we'd go here, there. But a rifle company - they say, go up that

hill - there's really no place to go, that's it. That's it, you

go up the hill. Andusually when they tell them to go up the hill,

it's because somebody's there. That, to me, was rough. Now, that--

I don't know how I would have done in something like that. But -

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s3:18

where we were at, the patrol works outfit, it's - a lot of them

were ,maybe, -- I usedto meet some people, they'd say, how can you do that, you'd be out there all by yourself. I'd say, yeah, but all you've got to do is hide. You know. It's just the nea

when there's a few, you can hide sort of - sort of blend in. Stick around alittle bit. And when there's a whole bunch of

you, and you can't hide - everyone knows you're coming.

L

Thank you for what you·· said before. It was very moving. You're

a kind man.

You mentioned last time about women who were working. That

was very intesresting. Thev-D:men .who were working in Bingham.

When didyou become aware that women were being hired to work.

EA Well, because firstof all, a good friend of my mother got a a job. She was comadre, which I explained before, 1bey baptize

a child there. It's a term of endearment, is that what .you say. AndY8~e comadre and compadre, you know, you never address them

again with their proper name, it's just not done. --She happend

to be a comadre of my mother's and she had children who were our age. And all of a sudden they were saying that she was going to go work for Kennecott. And this was about the first time that

I was quite aware of it that women were. And then we had another lady that lived down the tracks, she was a Mexcian lady too. And

it's kind of funny becuase she was a little fat little lady

and it was often wondered how in the world she was going to work.

But Kennecott was paying good wages. And , by then, you h a d a 1o

lot of American g-womenthat were working. But your Mexican women

n't. were quite getting

into that yet until

these two

that

r

said --

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s3:19

that started to work. And they just loved it. I mean, they -

they loved their work. I'm sure they - My mother's comadre just

really liked it.I can recallthat. And when she started to buy

a lot of things in their home - they had never had anything.

But - oh, then there was another lady that - that was the first

time - that I'd ever seen a dining room set. I had never

nobody had dining room sets. And - her name was - Rose. Gomez

and she's Fulmer now. But she worked. She was a single woman.

And she was workig for Kennecott. And she bought her mother

a dining room set. Andof course it was the biggest thing in

that town. Someobody had a dining room set. Rose had bought

a dining room set. And her daughter and I were the same age.

And we ran around together. And she come over to tell me to

come over to see-- and I remember going to their house and

seeing this. I had never seen anything so beautiful in my whole

life. In this little cupboard tinder-box littel house with this

beautiful dining room set that she had bought her mother when

she started work for Kennecott. This was - this other lady, too,

they started to buy things for their homes, which they had never

had. Mostly, like couches. Ah, like I said, this , dining

room set. clothes for themselves. These things people didn't really have nice things. Getting a permanent. This was not done.

corning into Salt LAke City to have a permanent. Because ladies

didn't have that. Oh, ... especially your Mexican ladies, they

didn't do that . . Yet.

L

LEtne interrupt you for a second. Could you - did you ~er

hear what he said about what happened to him before.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s3:20

EA OH I can remember when he first came, talking about the war and

thingslike that. I can recall. .Al.so that lE mentioned he came

and h~ had malaria very bad. And he would get real sick after

he first came home. And it was -.the malaria he had. I couldn't

out it together then,I was still with the John Wayne movies and

the heros and in them>vie houses. The patriotic thing -

L

Had you heard though the things that he just said ...

EA Not all of it, definitely not. I did not know that he had been

there to see some of the Hiroshima - or whatever it iwas - that

never.

L

Nagasaki.

EA Never. I remember mother used to keep a map. . .. I ·.;_ · -·don't know

where she got this map. Probably a map of 1892 or something. But

when letters would come, we had this missionary priest and he

visit the homes. And - with be letter, they tried to figure out

wherEhe was at, on the ma.p. By that time, where he was at. And

that's where my Mom would try to keep, you kow, kind cf where he

was at.His father- I think it was Father Geurris.

GA GUERRA.

EA He was from Spain. He was really a good missionary priest that

came. He did a lot of work, good work, among the people during

the war time He helped a lot= cheer up the mothers.

L

Soyour mother would follow, somehow, on the map.

EA Cause .he'd get theJetters and they'd be censored. You know. They

would get the lettter with nothingan it. And they'd be

censored.

OHI E&G Aguay o 3-4-85 s3: 21

GA I thought that was silly . You know, t he censor used to be the

people right in the -- well, they did pick out an officer,

a Captain. Now, he'd censor letters.He h ad no more ide as than

--as I remember, I've got a code, he said, My wi fe knows whe re

I'm at, my mother knows where I'm at. So you know,the~ had

a code. That's who was doing the censoring, you know. The -

EA That's what Father Guerras and my mother would try to do.

They'd try to follow on this map, where he was. So I know also

every night, we were called in, wherever we were at. And it was

the rosary to be said.And they - all our friends knew that we

had to be in at a certain time because - and my Dad knew a

rosary. I mean, it wasn't a short rosary, ti was a looong rosary.

And we prayed every --

L

Whatis a rosary prayer.

EA Well, see therosary its elf is j .us·t the l:eads. But then later on,
>
it's other prayers. And my DAd knew these by memory. And we'd

kneel there. And he'd pray--of course, we'd fight and poke each

other - while my Dad-- and our friends would wait outside

for us. Most c£ them ,;Q)Uld wait til we were through.becuase they

knew when we were through praying, we would come out. We would i

invite them in, _but sometimes they _ want to come in. And they'd

say, we'll wit outside for yous. And it was all during the

war. ..My . brother was gone .

L

You prayed every evening.

EA Every evening. My Dad and My Morn. And my Dad's rosary. And my

Dad's rosary. I'll never forgetmy Dad's rosary. And you know,

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s3:22

Dad died. Dad knew it by memory, knew his prayers very very

good. And after Dad died, I went to a funeral- a Mexican

funeral. And I don'tknow why people thought I knew how. And

right away, the Father says the rosary, they came up to me and

asked .if I would say the rosary like my Dad. I neverlearned.

(laugh') It was something - I never knew people expected me

to know this. To carry it on. He just knew it very beautifully.

I did not learn. I'm lucky I can say in Spanish let alone

memorized it. My Dad had it down. So that's my memory of the

war. And then my other brother, he was still at home. And he

was forever-he was going to get in. And he was going to get

in. You know, and he didn't get in til the very end. My mother

would not let him join. I do know that. And he had to wait til

he turned 18. he turned 18 in August and I think the war ended

in June or something. ARound there.

GA I think in Agust.

EA Anyway, he missed it completely, Because my Mom said definitely

not. She would not sign for him to join.

L

What you're saying is so very beautiful. What you're saying

Both of you - is so very moving. It's very special, what you're

saying.

Going back ... the women were hired .in the jobs that the men had

left behind?

EA Ahuh, the jobs that they had left behind. Well, some of them

becuase you still had a lot of - some workers, your older

_ workers. Like Dad, Dad was still working at the itme. But they

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 S3:23

drove the engines, the speedrs.

GAT Track shifters and speeders. the - ta machines, you know. Flags. Switch tenders. Flags were like switch tenders but

they didn't tend the switch. They'd flag the trains when it

was allright to go this way or that way.

EA I remember them on the speeders.

GA Yeah, the speeders are just like driving the car

EA we were grade school kids at the time. And the women would

passyou on their little speeders. It was - just -

GA I remember - alot of the kids were going from Bingham and

the students and that. And yet they brought a lot of soldiers

to Bingham to work.

They were the older types, you know. The

ones they drafted first. And maybe they didn't figure that they

could make it - or they were a_ little older. But I rernrnember

a lot of people in Bingham that lived in Bingham later, were

soldiers that - that - they give them a deferment to work in

the mines.

EA The US Mine brought a bt of them. Brought in a lot of those.

GA Yeah. EA I can remember that becuase the older girls started to go out

w--i-t-h

t-h- e s- e

boys

th-a=t--c-a-m~e-- in

.the

-

soldiers.

GA Yeah, most of them married them.

EA Yeah, married them. A lot of them married them. That's why they

stayed in Bingham.

L

Do you remember your brother corning home.

EA Yeah, I can remember. What I can ·remember, I was in junior high.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s3:24

Ah. And he kept writing that he needed points to come home and

we kept waiting to see when he could get all his points so he

could come home. That's what I can remember that we were counting

the points he had to make it so he could come home.

L

Do you remember the actual time and date?

EA I sure don't. I dure don't.

GA I know it wasday time becuase I took a cab from Salt Lake.

I remember the guy never charged me. He chargedme but he didn

charge me what it was. What it should have cost. I ·think it~

was about 5 bucks.

EA And he brought you to Bingham, to copperfield.

GA Right below the train houses.

EA Oh, fur goodness sakes.

GA I remember I walked up the stairs,· Up the last - up to the tracks.

And I met all tR~ y6~~hs on the stairs below the house.

I used to remember, god, they're small.

end side three

begin side four

L

Your sister and your brother.

GA That's all - you and Sam and Hess was

gone. But that's wha

I can remember, I took a cab frpm Salt Lake. And I had to

walk up the - well, that's the mly place to me - that where the

taxi could go.I'd hate to tell him to go up way around and

bring the road back - it seemd like - I thought it was pretty good

that he took me that far for the price he was charging me.

So I didn't want- even though there was road more that could

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s4: 25

h ave gone right behind the house, b ut that would have been way around again.

GA I comEback right after the war. I thi nk I was only in Japan about a month, maybe two months at the most. And then t hey s t a r t e d bringing us all.

EA I do remember the first Christmas he was home. He bought us-

me and my sister a doll - we were a little too big for dolls b y

then.But he brought _us a doll. And - I was in junior in high,

my sister was older. But he did buy us each a doll. I think he

thought we were still little.

GA

(alughs) they were little when I left ...

EA And he bought us a doll. I do recall that he bought us a doll f' t
for the Cfi~istmas he came in. I remember my sister saying, I got

a doll! Oh dear! (laughs) It's really funny. About 2 Christmases

a go. My godmother gave me a doll·. AndI said, My Godmother must

be really (laughs) .....Ah, Dear. Other than that.

GA I think - when for Christmas buying a doll, I remember that -

I think the first paycheck I got from Kennecott, I bought a

fridge. I rememebr that. EA Yeah. We had never had a fridge. We used to keep our meat

outside.

GA - -(alugh-si - --- -

=--

EA You bought a fridge. I can remember that. I can remember that dis-

tinctly. GA well, i t wasn't completely paid for. I think it was mostly paid

__ J or._ I th_ink ~ _made_ p ~ymen~ o ~ it__: But the first thing I got with my paycheck, the first paycheck, was the fridge.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s4:26

EA And we were the first family that had TV sets. (laughs) He bought

us a TV set. With the first -- we were the first family to have

that.

L

God it sounds like sweet times.

EA I toldyou, we started finally getting on our feet (laughs)

We finally started to get on Ollr feet. Itwas good sailing from

then on.

L ---~=-which one- of you was saying the women were being forced

out of those jobs.

EA Oh, yes. Like when my brother was back already, be women would

be forced, or made to work the track gang. The track gang is

very hard work. I mean, I think that's one of the - my brother

says he never workd so hard - the track gang. But. And they'd

put them right in front of - Well, what we had was a track that

ran rightin front of our homes, you know. So we were watching

them. We sat ontthe stairs to watch and laugh at them. If

nothing else. A couple ladies were pregnant. There was no way they

were going to be with a pick and a shovel. But Kennecott wanted

them to quit. And I don't thinktheyvanted to pay them severance

pay or something. Wasn't it?

GA I don't know. I doubt if they had severance pay them.

EA I don't know what they didn't - want to pay them, becuase they

wanted them to quit.

GA People were starting to come back.

EA Theydidn't need them anymore.

GA They wnated their job back.

EA They brought in Puerto Ricans. people. And so they didn't need

them.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s4:27

GA A lot of the jobs they h ad , t h e y r e ally couldn't do them.

You know. They - like some of t h em kept t h e speeders for

- - - a long time. But that was mostly like

group.

You know, speeders like a little 4-wheel g a sol i ne coach .

It has a regular truck, gasoline engine on it. Seats.

Just to carry passengers on it. So they stood on that for

a long time. It was just a matter of driving a car. Except

you didn't have to getoff the road.

EA What did they do over in the Peat mine. What --

GA Sarne thing, run fue little equipment.

EA Because that's 'where Chinch worked.

GA When she worked, she worked like a regular - with the men -

putting the _ __ on the -- in the water ...

EA But they made them quit. I remember as a girl, watching them

work the track gang (laughs).

GA I remember when I come back, what was her name?

Mary . . . MOYEDA.

EA She died about 3 years ago.

GA But whenI first came back, one of the first jobs I got was

on the salt stand. You'd spray - they had tanks of water.

Andyou' cput salt in the tank. They'd spray the car so they

didn't freeze in the winter. And I had - Mary Moyeda I remember

had that. But yet it was my job to go put the salt bags in

becuase she couldn't lift them. That's part of the - (laughs )

that's one of the things that you know when bey hired the women ,

they weren't really capable of doing it all. You now, you h ad t o

have sorneone ... yeah, she was - she was--

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s4:28

L

--someone do the heavier ..

GA Yeah, yeah. That's what I remember. I was track walking then.

But I remember one of my jobs was to go up there and load the

tahnk with salt. And it was old Mary Modeya. That's where she was

working.

L

So did the women quit afterthat--many of them.

EA Oh, the majority of them The fact that the majority of them quit

that track gang. I think there was two or three big American

women that could do it. Thse big Swede kind of a women. They're

just big.

GA I think the only ones that lasted were the ones that got into

a janitor job. Now, there were some - there up til about 8 or 9

years ago. That had lasted out from the war.

L

Really.

GA Either they started out as janitors or they kept getting bummed

back and ended up with that scene - that's something that

they could do so they really couldn't-- And then by that time,

it was a union busine-s. And everything else, so you really

couldn't touch it.

L

S othey were pretty secure there.

GA Yeah. there was, I forget her name, she was a janitor and she

started ot during the war. But she lasted on I think -- maybe

even retired. That was.

EA Everyone else we know.

GA all theother ones - as far as

, and all that, they

were gone.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s4:2 9

GA I know that - one tha t used t o r un the speeder for the supervisor ,

she lasted a long time. That's a l l s he had t o do . The supervisor

had his own little speeder. He ould go a round and i nspe c t - so

she washis chau ·ffeur, so she lasted a long time. But -

L

You said you walked the track. What was that?

EA That's what my Dad did for a long time.

GA It's-- you walk it to see whether there's something wrong and

- -ynu--fi.x it,-you- know~- rt's- whatI'd done right after I come back

from war for about a month. Then they gave me a flag. I must

have stood there for a long time. I remember that used to be a

boring job before I finally decided I better get into something

with a little more future (laughs) because that wasn't--

So first I tried the carpenter gang. And hat was hard work.

That was something. You know, you think a carpenter gang, you'r

going to build homes. You know. Like I say, carpenter work.

But instead of that, itwas cement work and cribbing work.

Cribbing-building cribbing ~to holdhillSJack. Either big switch-

ties or cement - things like that- and cement work. There was

a lot of construction always going on. You pour floor or

buildings and psuhing a wheelbarrel with cement, it's hard.

Then you go - I went to the machinist. That's where I stood

L

At that time after the war, what did youthink you were going

to do. EA Like I said, I thought I was going to work for Kennecott. The

women ; ere - working for kennecott. Th ere wasn'tmuch for a woman

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s4:30

to do in Bingham to do at all. You know. I don't think I ever even

thought of it. I knew there was restrictionsthere. So I just never ..

L

Against women ...

EA Against women and my Dad wouldn't have allowed it at the time.

So.

L

Didyou have dreams -did you dream.

EA I don't think so. I can't recall about doing something? No.

I'm not an ambitious person. I don't think. Never have been. I

take what comes. Whatever it's going to be will be.

L

So you just--

EA Weot with the tide. When my sister - When I graduated, my

sister was at home. And she went to work. And she got to work

at a store. And I stood home and helped my Mom. and my other

sister was about to graduate, the,one behind me, I thought,

well, now it's my turn. I waited my sister out. She was a brilliant

girl. And same my sister behind me - straight A student.

She's just realy good. And she got scholarships. There was no

wayI could say, hey, you stay home and let me go out. So she

-- I was - that's the way it was going to be. My other sister

was much younger. She was one of the little ones.

L

Soyou ~ve up schhool.

EA No, I graduated but I didn't get no other education. Just

help raise the youngerales.

L

What didyour father die of?

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s4:31

EA My Dad was sick for a long time. He was what you call, a chronic

sickness. Hehad very bad lungs. He had emphasyrnia. He had

asthma and he died~ cancer. At the very last, he didn't even

die of what he had suffered from for so long. My mother died

before my Dad. My mother was a healthy woman. I never would have

thought that my mother would have died before my Dad. See, my

Dad was the one who had been so ill for so many years. My mother

got sick. I think in one month, I think she got

L -- Wha-t year - did she die.

EA I think in 1960. She had a brain tumour. And it hit her like

out of nowhere. Within a month, she was gone.

L

So your parents didn't die around the war ..

EA No--much much later. We were all mostly all grown up by then.

My mother didn't see. My mother only saw two grandchildren. We

dont have1Do many. We're a small. ~amily. As you can see, neithe-

one, nobody married. But she only saw two. My Dad lived to see

three. My Dad used to say .it used to be ernbarassing to him.

All his cmpadres and everybody had oh 20 grandchildren. And then

they ask me and I have to say two. I wish people wouldn't ask

me how many grandchildren! have. (laughs) But anyway. And my

brother used tohave -well, my btoerh only had one and my sister

had one. And the only ones that wererarried at the time. And

EA But_tbat was the sad part that they would--be the01ly--my mother

didnt' even live to see a granddaughter. She saw two grandsons.

L

Didyou have any plans at that time, when youcame back from the

war, things you were aiming for, thinking about, ·..

on what you were going to do.

GA Oh, I think you always have plans. I think a lot of my big ones,

you know, everybody at that time. I was suppsoed to have been

pretty smart in school and I always thought to myself, I;m going

to be a lawyer. That was my dream. That in

r1 · · That used to

be the idea that lawyer made money.

Thatwould be something ...

I come back and I started looking. Here I have a job. I thought

I'd go to the university, I really didn'thavethat kind of money

that

I didn't really think the GI bill was that much.

Ofocutse I could have gone--NO AMBITION is probably what I should

say, I had what I thought was a good job.But you'd have to

call them dream .. Yes, I wish I had gotten a better aducation.

ButI wonder, you know, what I could have done with a little

more. But I'm not really that - I'm not really that bad off.

L

No, you'renot. You both stayed very loyal to your parents and

helped them out.

GA I think it's just a matter of--it was expected and we never seen

nothing wrong with it. I really can't - I've never really gotten

over the idea that the fact that parents and children too, s soon

as they get older, they move. And - what - sometimes the parents

don't want them. I mean, thy're less expensive, you're old enough--

go. Sometimes the kids, you know, now we've got a job

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s4:33

You know, end side four

Ijust never - never entered us

begin side five

GA --just that it's something. Why -- I've always thought - when

I was younger, why didn't you go get yourself an apartment. I say, why? I couldn't figure it out where I had it better. Maybe that is the reason.

EA Alot of people tell me, we never though you'd never marry. A lot

of my firends would say. And I'd tell them, to get married to

get married is never right. It never works. And so - I just don't

see that either, the idea you're going to go out and get

married just for the sake of getting married. To me, that is

just - Of all my friends that married, Ithink only one

marriage lasted. And to me that i 9 staistics. I mean, I just--

I can't--

L

That says alot to you.

EA It really says alot to me. That they marry - and they raise

their families and this is fine. 20 years later, that's a Jot

of heart ache, when that marriage breaks up. And I don't think

I'd put myself through something like that.

L

Yeah.

EA . Like I say, about 6 or 7 of my closest friends - I think one

marriagelasted. That to me, is, oh ..· and i have seen themthrough

these things And I know the heartacheit's cause and.

L

I-I was impressed by your imput into your family. Youreally

helped your family ... get a better life ...

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s5:34

GA Wel l, I neve r really thou ght it wa s helping them much. I know we

I know we all d id . But I nev er re a l ly thought, you know, when you say help - that you i.mply that y oudeprivedyourself - deprived

yourself of -- I always figured I was doing everything that I

wanted fornyself anyway. When I was younger- you know, I said that

before, you know. I used to take a lot of trips. Now, my

trips are all to Reno and Vegas. B--I don't really travel. But I

used to go back East in the summer just to watch the New York

Yankees and I wouldalways plan it whenthey were inthe west, St. Louis,

when the old Browns where there, Cleveland, Detroit. And I'd follow

themaround the city. You know, I'd stop at St. Louis, they were

there. Then I'd go over to Cleveland, like that. And I done a bt

of traveling in the states. Not all over. Iused to do a lot of

it. I never thought I was really depriving any - of mys~lf anything.

I thought it was leading a pretty good life. You know, I thought

I was doing pretty good. So I don't really think it was anything

of - that you helped or anything.

L

You didn't think that ~u lost anything at all by helping.

GA No ..

L

You gained.

GA Gained a lot of it. Whenthey told us to move out of Bingham. And

I bought this house here. I didn't do it so much for them.I done

it as much for myself. I had a plac~. I knew sooneror later.I

never thought the idea of renting. You know, that that's real l y

a good wa yto go. You know, you pay for 50 years, like my Dad did .

And then when the guy tel lsyou it's t ime , you know, you get out. (l aughs)

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 sS:35

That asn't really the way to go. It's really not - ah - I think

we were all kindof glad that we were able to help a little. we

could have done more. Because I think like I said before I

--we never knew really what it was in the 30s and that - I have

an idea that mybe ± was a lot worse than we thought. I never

really - it never really hit us like that. But I think maybe

--maybe we come close to now making

if you really know of something like that, I don't know.

L

Didyou

Was the union going in Kennecott when you got back.

GA Yes.

L

Did jOU join right away?

GA Yeah. Yeah. I-I- when I joined, I come back - Well, when I

left I was in the Union already. That was the Old Mine Mill

Everyone that belonged either to the p

department, the track,

if you joined, you joined the mine mill. You know, everyone had

their own union. You know, we've always had a lot of them-craft

unions, electircal, machinists, railroad unions. Things like that.

L They \\ere all separate.

GA They ~re all separate unions. And the union that wasin our

jurisdictionwas Mine Mill. So I was a member c£ the Mine mill

when I leftl When I come back, I still went in the same departments,

0 youj,ust join up again. When you leave them, like when I - even when I went to carpenters, ~that was still, by then, they - they

made it into a r~gular AFofL/CIO. That was steel workers

by then. You could have may -be not, maybe it was still mine mill.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 sS:36

But it was the same union, so I didn't even have to join that.

When I went to the Machinist, I just joined that. Joined that .

But as far as -- since I started, it was already there. And
most joined. Some mthem - there's been some that never

joined. There's some to save due money. Some really didn't

believe in them.

L

Dld you believe in the union?

GA I - the old mine mill, ah, I didn't quite go with them.To me,

they wre a little radical. But - ah, they were just setting up

then. They were having - it was a little harder then. but _to me,

it was - ah, they were (laughs) I don't know how to say it,

I don't think 1bere ··s a union that's quite in · their position

like right now. But like you see the. old socialist party

here in Salt Lake. They \ere almost ____ likethat.~hey believed

in the whole - you know, people should own the mine. It was a

little bit of radical on this--them--ah.

L

Interesting.

GA But like I said, after I got a littleolder and I getting to think,

I think well maybe that's the way they had to get started. Because

they had a rough - you know, there wasn't any unions around at

that time. They had a - company was a tough - it was a tough

competitor. They had everything --· they used to play us off-

first - I guess the mines in New Mexico or Arizona even when

Kennecott, you know, was one cornpany,wienthey madeit one company.

Then they used to. play the mines off against each other. Then

they used to play all bese western mines against Chile. So

L

How didthey do that.

OHI E&G Agua yo 3-4-85 sS:37

GA Well, see, you wouldn't s i gn a contra ct with this one, you'd sign

one with this one a little bit. You'd keep - and it always

seemed tome like aBingharn mine was the one t hat was always out. You know, they'd almost force you to go on str ike. And they could stay out longer becua se they could keep themi.nes in Arizona and New Mexico working, so it didn't really matter whether we signed or not. And we knew we were in for a rough time all the time. And like I said, when we finally get what you call---

L
When youcarne back, was there a long striek you were on.

GA Right off the bat.

L

Why did that strike happen.

GA I tink becuse there wa$ no raise during the war because they had

price control. And after the war, the company didn't want to-

didn't want to give it and the Union wanted ot makeup for you know

what they had since then.

L

Lost time.

GA Sothat took us 6 months, rightoff theba.t. When I come back.

EA THat was a rough strike. GA That was about when they first started really - when tie unions
really started feeling thatrmybe they could get what they

wanted. EA The union would give us food. I remember, they'd give us fish.
we don't particualrly- I didn't luke it- I don't like it y et. But I don't know · where they got all this big old trout-was it

trout. GA Carp.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 sS:38

EA Carp, Huge carp. They brought to your home.

I remember wnother putting them in the tub. These big -- and

we'd go over and watch - thre's no way we weEe going to eat that.

L

You mean they were alive.

GA CArp satays alive for a long time. I think bey got some of these

old fishermen to go down to Utah LAke.

EA They were huge. GA Oh, yeah, carp grows 20-30 pounds.They're big fish.

EA And they'd giveyou 5 or 6 of them andyou'd have big old carp--

I remember in the middle of the night, my Dad was throwing them

away. There was no way we wre going to eat them. And I remember

they also gave us butter.And My Dad said only rish people ate

butter. And we were not rich people. We didn't eat much butter

then. We had no occasion to eat butter. Very little butter. But I remember they gave us bbtter. That's theonly thing that sticks

in rnymind. Thebig fish and the bntter becuase my Dad said we

were not rich and we did ·_not eat butter. Only rich people ate

butter. So, now, every time I buy a pound of butter every

other day, I think, Rich people eat butter. (laughs)

L

What was it like being out on the strike foryou. When you had

just come back.

GA Actually, I always kickedmyself becuase it was dumb. I waited.

I was here in December and I knew they were talking about strike.

And if I hadn't corn eback to work, I could have gone on unemployment.

You know, I was mt of the service. But I waited and I said, - finai°ly,

they decided,well, they'renot goingout. So I come back to work.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 sS:39

And I don't think it was within a month after I come to work,

an- I lost everything. See, I couldn't get othing. Becuase I

was on a strike. Mostly, what I feel is that I always said

to myself, boy, you're dumb. Why don't you wait. wait a while more.

EA Relax

GA

(alughs)

L

Was it a tough strike.

GA Yeah. Yeah.

L

What made it tough ..

GA I think the fact that there wasn't any money (laughs) I can remember going to Tooele - maybe it wasn't that bad, Cause I can remember

going to Tooele and they offered me a job and it was out on that

railroad that goes through there, working~ that track and I

rernrneber it was summer. And I remember the sun beats so hot on it, I thought to myself, this isn't worth it. So I didn't take

it. So maybe it wasn'ta s tough as whatI thought. But I remember going out there and everybody was saying, oh, go out there.

You're a serviceman. You've got - they give you credit. So many

points like that, you get in government. They offered me one

all right. But it - for me, wasn't worth it. LHow did the company take the strike. Did the company try to break the

strike. GA I've never been in a strike where the company really made a hard

effort to strike like, you know, bringing in strike breakers.

Now, I'vebeen in some where there'sbeen near riots. One we had

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 sS:40

about, I think about '70-something.

EA Is that when you were an officer.

GA Yeah. That one got a little sticky. That me night, when they decided

that they were going to close the P plant, they must have had

100 policemen there. Ah, but that's about as hard as I could

see. A lot of it was still only - throwing rocks at the busses

when they brought in the foremen to work at the P~~~~

Precipitating Plant, that's where - they collect the water from

the hill, you know, they run acid through the water, put it up

in the hill, let it run 6own through the ore body, then they

catch you down below in the plant andit makes about 90-~-

% precipitive copper, you know, it's out of the water.

SO they could work that with .only foremen. That's what they were

trying to work. Now, that one I r~member was tough-but - They

never got to thepoint, like, say, Phelps~~- down in Arizona

done where they brought in new workers. ALl themes that I've

been in, they·tve never done that. They've closed their plants.

They never tired to work the mines.

L

Did they close it during that 6-month strike.

GA Yeah, they closed it. They ·never tried to work - like say, they

worked the p-plant on several occ~sions, wien they tried.

P- Just the letter 'P' for precipitation. That's what we

call the p-plant, but it's a precipitation plant. Now, that

they've always tried to work. Becuase like I say, you can work it.

It's a good money maker, See, in my opinion, that's going to be

the last thing to go up there. Even if they ever close the hill,

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 sS:41

you're going to keep 50 or 60 men t o run that,Iiant. And it's still going to be a money maker. For as long as they keep water up there, until the water gets-- I guess water runs thorugh the same channels all the time until they don ' t pick up anymore copper out of the ore, or s omething like t hat. EA This one--he says, '78, you said. I remember an incident i n that. My Dad had retired by then. Was it? GA Well, 70-something

EA Well, and my youngerlrother had already started to work. And he

had goneup and they were picketing. And i t.- ·was getting rouch.And

~~~- had gone up and it was late at night. And I remember we

were sitting therein the front room, we were here. And my

younger brother come in, he was out galavanting. And my Dad said

to him, Where ave you been? And he said, JustOJ.tside. I · was

justoutside. And he said, Your - brother's out there by himself.

And they're having trouble up at the mine and that's why your

brothers

he said, take care

end side five

begin side six

EA sohe went. And later, he laughed. He said, Gee, I didn't know

I was supposed to have been up there. He was a young boy. 18

years old. And he didn't really. But my Dad was really- and

he waited up for him. My Dad used to go to bed real early. But

waited up for him, I can remember, when he came in. And I

was scared for both of them, I was scared for both of t h em.

(laughs)

OHI E&G Aguayo 304085 sS:42

L

I could see how you would be.

EA I was scared. I thought, oh, they are are having problems. I

know he had taken a rifle. And oh, I was just 00

L

You had taken a rifle.

GA Yeah, but they never really got anything ike, like I say, most

of it was just to showoff. Thel'K)st trouble I ever had on a

pick line is - is - well, I should sya, they took my picture

one time, the company. You k-ow, they have the public relations

on the picket, because they try to scare you. And they sent the

sherrif up there. I was on thepicket line. And they sent a

sherrif up there with - what do you call it, not a subpoena,

a warrant - a warrant. That doesn't sound like the right word

either. But anyway. The paper said, you guys stop interfering

with the traffic, ~·re going to arrest you. Andthen he parked

his car right there, alongsidecf us. And about this time, ah,

one of these big tractor trailers came up with a dozer, ontop

of .it. He's going to go up the hill. So I stopped thetruck any-

way. And I talked to this guy, -he was a teamster driver

and I talked him into unloading the tractor right thereat the

bottom of the hill. He unloaded it.

L

How did~utalk him into it.

GA Nothing. I told him we were on strike, told him, you are

supposed tobe a good union man, this and that.

The teams~ers, they have a reputation not only for being run

by Mafia, but I guess forr:eing good union members. You know--

to him it wasn't--in fact, he probably thought it was a good

deal. He had an excuse -- he didn't have to go, you know,

climb the hill. Probably saved him an hour's work.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s 6 :4 3

He could go h ome and s ay the pickers didn ' t let me go through.

ANyway, Ihad him unload it. But, the company - they -they had

the photographer the~e and he c ome over a nd t ook my picture,

just trying to scareyou off. That's wha t I fi gur e d . That-

I figured that's all he was going to do anyway. The sherrif

didn't do nothing. He parked over there. Thepaper he had. I

odn't know whether it was not worth nothing or he didn't

think it was worth the trouble. Becuase he turned around and went back.

EA I don't know if this is the same strike. My married brother.

He's married andmd a family, you could .understand this. He was

having a real hard time during the strike. And he came down

here one day and he was talking. He said, I think I'll just

have to cross thatp.cket line. And my brother,

you

try and we'll both stop you. he went wt and got another job.

Thepoor man. But I felt, you know, he was married. He has

responsibilities. It was different. But I remerrher them saying,

and I thought, oh gee, you know. Because I remember both,

telling him, you try it and we'll be the01es that will stop you.

He said, I'll cross±, I've got to work.

L

It was a tough situation.

GA I think ·.alot of times, like f say,. it could have got worse a lot

of times I think if the company wouldhave made effort to put

people up there. Because a lot of times, I think the people

would have - really would have stopped them.They used to

make an attempt to stop the foreme n . But we know the rules o f

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s6:44

the game.And foremen are not, they're not day pay. And we've

always gone on--the only thing is they're not supposed to do

our work. So it's - you know a little different. Thisand that.

That's about the ~ly way we had trouble with is foremen.

And then one time, they used to - Thepolice would form lines,

like they show them, and they'd walk through us. And then one

R

comesout with his lunch bucket and we're

all yelling at him And I reached out and I knocked his lunch

bucket down on the ground. Now L~~Ray is about 6'2" or

something like that. Weighs about 240. (laughs) And he wasn't

thatold. At that time, he couldn't have been 10 years older

than. He was-- I thought as soon as I had done that, I thought,

well, that's pretty dumb. (laughs)

But he didn't - I think bey were all laughing- none of them really

wanted to make trouble. You know, most of the foremen are like

us. Theyron't want to go to work but they-you tell them

they're job's on theline. You know. They don't want to go.

All they need is an excuse too. To stay home, you know.

(laughs)

L

Whathappened, did he justp.ck up the bucket and go on.

GA He gave me a dirty look. Pickedit up. Why, I always thought that

was kind of a dumb thing. You wouldn't do it if you were alone.

But when everybody's around, you - and everybody yelling, you

do things like that. You take some risks. You take some.

I rememberaie time, Iwas backedup against a gate. And we were

in there yelling~ the people working across and some of them

threw rocks, you know, across the fence to the people working.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s6:4 5

I looked at the lock, I can

so I got a piece of

wood and stuck it in the key h ole a nd broke it off . And stood

by it. Andfuen\E waited until the n ext bus load come in . And they

couldn't get in the gate. (laughs) Didn't do noth ing,eccept

hurt the lock until they come in with cutters andcut thelo c k

off. You know, that's no big deal. That's about the extent o f the rowdiness that you--

L

The company 'sway of handling a strike was just to starve you

guys, keep it goinga long time.

GA I think it was-I think they used to use that as a way to keep

prices up, more or less anything. Now, there's really nothing tokeep it up. I think at that time, they usually decide, prices are down, we've got too much production, ~·11 shut this one down for awhile. But you can't shut it. You know, everybody goes on
unemployment. It cost the company money. So bey find a little

way, you know, they'll tell you, we~re not going to give you no

raise this time.

All you haveto do that and everybody's upset.

I even used to think sometimes the unions were in .collusion with

them Becuase they knew the strike wasn't-it wasn't so much a matter of strike, it was just the matter of fact that you close

the mine down until prduction cuts down. You know, it's just

--it was just that idea. You shut production, you know, the mine

down until the costs go back up, until - and pretty soon, they

come up and you'll settle for about what wasoffered the first

time anyway. I think was verylittle I think until until we got

the cost of living, I think we were just going out for pennies

all the time.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-4-85 s6:46

L

When did that come, the cost of living.

GA Mostly about '74.

L

My god, so late.

GA Yeah, ours was late. I know the steel workers had it,

the steel mills and everybody else. By then, the steel worker

unions were the big ones. Sothey mostly got it in. But it was

after. It was maybe in the 70s, 74 somewhere there. But that's

been our big moeny worker. That's been the thing that kept us

up. That not only kept us up with inflation, I think it kept

us ahead of it. All :the other things, were little extras here

and there, but that cost of living, that was a real life

saver. I think when whey give it, they didn't think it was

really going tobe that much. Then when 2 years ago, like ·

maybe, what - when did inflationstart really going up, that's

when they really got the raises n9w on account of that.

By then, (laughs) it was getting too late to take it back.

ButI thinkthey're going to go after it this next time.

L

So up untilthenthere had been many strikes, but they hadn't

achieved a whole lot, you're saying.

GA I think you achieve alot. But I think a lot of times, I don't thi n. k t h e stri'kes are - t h ere'snsoot much strikes, I always

thought a convenient way of cutti~g production. You know,

a company offers us maybe ten cents, fifteen cents an hour,

and when we come back, we get maybe 16 or 17, it really wasn't

that much. But everyone seemed to know-if you didn't go out,

you weren't going to get that.But if you waited long - everybody

what were you going to do . I f you didn ' t go out, you wouldn't

get any of it. (laughs) So I sai d , t he y used to play us off

against each other. They u s ed to p lay the western mines agal·. nst Ch1.'lewhenthey used to own Ch·ile. Th e y closed themines here, and said, we stay closed. You know. They 've got

refineries in Baltimore - they'd get the copper from Ch ile.
And after they lost the mine n Chile, they had had-- they

were a little stuck with what they had here, so then they had to pay more money. And by then, we had the contracts, you know, and atthe same time, more unification on the -- all the mines. Even different companies, you know. When steel workers finally organized Phelps Dodge and the C inspiration, everybody else in the same way. Then I think we

got stronger than they were. If it wasn't for the price of copper really going to pot. I think we were set. Because we

,could-if we closed one done, there was nobody bringing in copper. Before then, they --all the companies used to own mines overseas. And there was no way you ould touch their mines.

L

No way you could have any impact on that.

GA It's a - Now, I think it's swung back again (laughs)

It isn't so much that the union got weaker and the company got

stronger, it's just the fact that we know it and they know it

the price isn't there. It just - there'snothing you can do about

it.

EA Well, actually she was just a£raid to let them go by themselves.

I don't think they needed protection.

GA Just to keep kids. She probably thought kids picked on you, or

something. Babysitters away from home, that's about what it was.

EA One icident she used to talk about. When my sister went. And she'd

come home crying and cring that one of theboys had hit her

~ n the way home. _And m_y mother really got on his case. ~d --the

boy that hit her was named Carl. From the Espanoza family. And

my -mother would say to him, I have toldyou that you're supposed

to take care of your sister. My brother very nonchalently said,

why don't you go over and check on him. Apparently, he had beat

him him. Because he beat up his sister. And my sister ·used to say

too, that when she went, because she couldn't speak the

English and the teacher was always afterh:r. And she'd say,

Where's your brother? And she said, she had no idea where she

was except upstairs. So she'd point upstairs cause that's where

her brother was. So other than that.

L

Upstairs in the school.

EA It was two stories and they uounger kids were in thel:x:>ttom

and she knew her brother was upstairs. And she-d say-she said,

_y_o-.:U::-_ · ---=----- -Iremembe~ the _teacheL wo_ulcL_say-1 _!ihereisyour l:rother

and she'd pointupstairs. that's where her brother was.

L

So you guys were pretty tight as a family. I mean, brothers

and sisters. You really

up to each other?

GA

I- imagine so. And alot - you know, I really thought I was the

only one who had trouble I guess my sisters must too. But I

OHI E&G Agua yo 3-13-85 sl: 3

figured by then, they must have lea r ned t o live with it . I know

when I went, I always believed tha t' s t he reason I got kept

back in the first grade. You know, except for .the fi rst grade .

After that I was pretty smart kid in school. But that f irst blamed
year, I always believed the fact that I didn't know what .they

were taling about becuase I couldn't speak the language.

But--I can't even remember the :first year, but after that

it was

L

learned in a year.

GA --school never any problen after that.

EA No, we kept up .In fact, we were ahead in most of our classes.

GA I just never really thought that my sisters had that ·trouble.

EAOh yes.

GA --they all followed me after that. And then my older sister.

EA And she had a bt of trouble, Ithink. I think she was really.

Like I said, I didn'thave that much because I ran around with

a whole bunch of girls in the same predicament as us.

Andt~n

had gone to school a year ahead of

me, she was a year older. And Mrs. Gotiaris .. But she got

held back. So when I went, we were together again. And Imean,

we just were always together. The two ofus. But she was a year

older than me. And she knew alittl ebit more. She knew more

or less the ropes. And she knew more or less what the teacher

was talking about by then. So she just kind of--and I remember

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 sl:4
the teacher talking and you'd just stare at her becuase you had · no idea. And you think, I wonder what this lady's saying. You just didn't have no idea. You knew when:it: was time to play. You know, this and that. And I also remember they put you in different reading groups. And you had your smart kids in the reading groups and then you had the dumb kids. And we were always in the dumb group of the reading class. I it was all these little Mexican kids there (laughs) But I remember being there til half a year. And then by the half of the year, i was in thet op reading group already and Commadre perle was put down·one and I was right up= just as soon as you knew what you were doing.They give you the word. Little words. And then youtake a litte match box. Everybody had a match box. And you kept your wordin these little match boxes and you'd take them home to study. Little words~- little pieces of paper with words. SEE. 4N1ykind of word. I can just remember, See Dick Run. See Dick Run. Every little individual word. And every studenthad one of these. Different --all the words. An you kept them together and then you took them home to study. And you'd take out your little match box. And you'd if you were real rich, you had a tobacco .box. But not very many had:obacco boxes. We all had match boxes. Just the little match
boxes. That's where ~u kept your words and that's how you learned to read. individual little words. Oh, and you used to look for thoseinthe garbage dump, (looking

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-1 2-85 sl: 5

for tobacco) but you didn't find one . You'd use the little

match boxes. Andit took me about a half a year to get out

of of that dumb group, dumb reading book t hat t hey used to

call. Just Mexican kids in that dumb reading book . Because

none of us knew the language. We just didn't know t heJa.ngu age at all. So.

L

Were the teachers strict?

EA They were. I think they were. I remember some of the kids getting

hit with the ruler or on the head, you know, thingslike that.

But you know, mysister, the one that follows me, Rebecca, she

tells about getting hit on the hands with the ruler. I don't

remember what she was doing, but she'll say, she hit me. She did

hit me. I don't know what she was up to because that girl was

smart . . I mean, by the time .Ebe went-she was - like I said,

we were speaking English at home by then.

L

Sosbe must have picked it up.

EA Yes. Andof course, we told , THEY'-'RE GOING TO call you to do ·.this

and todo this. So if;i0u know ahead of time what to expect, I

think--

L

So you prepared her. really.

EA Yes. And I went to school From kindergarden to ..high school with

some of the kids. And sometimes at our reunion, we still get

together.And we laugh over some of the things we did when we were

grade school Because they £ill remember. Iremember this last

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 sl:6

reunion I went to which is kind o f f unny, we were talking about

t h e bri dges t h e y used t o hav e b etween copperfield and bingham.

Before they made the tunnel. And they tore those down, about

what year. Before the war?

GA 37-38--

EA And we were talking about that and one of my school mates,

Max Ivy and Ronnie Burke. They\Ere saying how they used to play

on these dd bridges. And I said, there was no bridges when we

were growing up. and they said to me, there was too, but your

Dad didn't let you do anything. Youvere never allowed to come

down to play. And I said, well, that musthave been true.

That's why I don't remember the bridges. And they swore there was bridges. And with my class of kids, my class did play with

it. I didn't. I know Ididn't.

L

You never saw them.

EA I can't remember. And

Ivy said to me, I just about died.

You know you didn't. Your Dad din't let you do anything.

(alughs) So.

So it's very true But we meet every so oftne. And we still

know each other. And we have a great time. When we get together

and laugh overour grade school days.

L

You maintain a contact.

EA Oh, yes, we have reunions. Like I say, we had grade school kids-

We went together from kindgarden to high school, a lot of us.

L

Why do you --bother-to stay tcge~er.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-1 2 -85 sl:8

I had to go down and get him reinstat ed into his class. And±

was for fighitng. And it wasn't even h i s fight . he j u st - stuck

up for somebody else. And got into - I remember what t he teacher

was sayng, thatshe had to expell him beca us e he had f ought, it

wasn't realy his fault. But they both had, and they both h a d--

and hey had to stay home a couple of days. I remember my mother was just moritifed that smebody would get expelled. (laughs) And my youngerbrother did. For fighting. And he had fought good. So.

L

alittle jump--

When didyou guys become aware of the fact that you might have to leave Bingham one day.

EA Whentheytell you to stay in your house becuase they were going to blast and all of a sudden the rocks would be falling all overyour

house-the roof. They'd blast right :behind .your house--

I mean, they were right behind you.

GA

I don't think we had an idea. I think where we lived was probably

the first- They ~t rid of Dinkyville befare they started tearing

out Bingham proper than the other ones. So we were about the first ones -- We always had the railroad going behind us. And

but they never worked them for a long time. See, they were--

the tracks right below our house was about the only active

one. You know. But there was always the ones that were up

above us. But they were old. And half the time--

EA They wren't worked. GA tey weren't worked. In fact, when'v.E were k ids, to make spendin g

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 sl:7

EA Oh, there's just something you don't find nowadays. I mea~, you

see them, and it's like going back - I think - has a lot to do

with it. You remember some of the good times that you had.

Which were mostly, like I said, my grad~ school days were very

happy. That's thereason I think I love to see some of the kids.

L

How do you remember teachers?

GA I don't really remember their hitting me. I can't say--maybe

I've blocked .it out of my mind. But I don't realy-- you know,

I can't remember my grade school. Like Isaid, my first year,

I don't remember at all. From ~about the third grade, !remember

a little. I start to remember a little. But I don't really

recall the first grade-you know, trying to learn. I know I must

have been really having trouble. BecauseI can just imagine, you

know-- then I know I was held bac~ inthe first grade. But I

really can't remember. Iremember it later. You know, 4th-5th-6th.

I remember that. I don't remember being hit. And I don't recall

really anyone else. I know that theyysed to get smart with the

rulers and that. But (laughs) Of course, I don't know

what happened when they got taken to theprincipal's office.

I don't recall ever going there (laughs) but I know once and

a while, somebody'd go ....Maybe t~ey took care of them out

there.

EA My younger brother got expelled in the 6th grade for fighting

And I remember I had to go. I was out of high school - by then.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 sl:9

money,W= would go and steel the copper wire off the tracks.

And trolly lines. And they - becuase there wasnothing there

working. And I remember - I don't know whether you've ever seen

.

tracks

rialroad

or rot. But they usedto have copper scraps to

bound thembgether. I don't know for what reason. Maybe to .make

connections becuase they used to run on trolly wires. Above.

L

The electric railway.

GA Yeah. P

things like that. Sothe railroad had some joints,

~~~~

they'd have copper - big strapes - each ~e weighed about

a pound. SC!{ou'd go with an axe or rock or whatever. Cut those

off I think copper was only selling about 5 cents a pound.

But still, still enough. But I remember all those tracks, there

used to be about 9 or 10 of them. They hardly ever worked. The

lines up on the top would be down. You know, the winds ·would blow

them or whatever. And1hey would't pick it up, the wires.

Just ~ave them there probably until some other time that they

needed them or something. So you'd go around and chop off -

(laughs) There used to be the junk men that would come up. I

don't know how long- maybe once a week or something. And these

he was probably getting more for it. But he was collecting

it - . with a .wire. We'd sell it to him. And --

EA our house was the end house over here. And the one house on

the rightside, that was privately owned. Becuase alot of people

did own ·their---

end side one

OHI E&G Aguayo 3012085 s2:10 (begin side 2)

GA --company -- you'd get little additionsto what you wanted.

EA They'd just build on to it. And that one house to our right,

privately owned. And our house was in the middle. And it was

company-(owned) And then the other two on the other side were

privately owned. And those were thefirst houses to go. You

know, that came around and said, hey, you've got to leave your

homes.

L

How--leave what they own.

EA QThey paid them.

GA They _told them ·they could take them off. And I think later on,

they gave them 100$. That's about all. They didn't give them

too much.

GA They got permission - if you want to move it. Well, where are

you going to move it. There's· no roads Like in and out,

so you could bring in a truck and haul it.

L

No road to get in ..

GA Not out. There was a road into Bingham, but you wouldn't get

a house through a tunnel. Andyou wouldn't have made it through

the stretch - you owuldn't have gotten it through the streets

of Bingham, too narrow. You could have copped them up-- but

the houses weren't worth that much. but they did tell fuem.

They could tear it down, take out the .hmber if they wanted

it ...

EA So that was the first few homes. And I remember we wre sitting

outsidean the,PJrch one evening and Mr. Swain - Frank SWAIN

OHI E&G Aguayo s2:ll 3-12-85

Yeah. And he was superintendent of one kind?

GA He was security is what he was.

EA And he came around and said, you've got a month to move. The

company wants your home. WHAT? (laughs) And that's the way we

were told. One evening.

GA

I remember- when they moved the homes in L

. You know,

all the hullabaloo, the people there- and Kennecott moved

theirs and they moved alotof them over to Copperton. Paid

a lot. And they - were in tt.ae same position. A lot of them owned property put some of them didn't even own property. But by then, you know, it had alot to do with publicity.

And everything. The company couldn't really get away with

you know, going over and tear it. Just get out. By then,

bad publicity hurt them. Of course, we didn't really have

nothing- no recourse or antyhinglike that becuase like I said,

we didn't own anything. We didn't own the land. We didn't

own th hohse. Some of the homes down in Bingham, I know the last one that moved -- Wally Swenson, we worked in the same place there until we retired. He retired about ayear ago before me.

I think we worked togehter for 40 years. (laughs) But he was the

last -one out of Bingham. He wouldn't move. But he owned

his property. And he lived righten the main part of town.

They had to have it.

L

He owned the land too?

GA But he held out for a long time. They give him pretty good.

It was enough to get ~im another house. Not enough to get

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s2:12

rich on. But he built a nice home in the Midvale area.

But - he wouldn't move until he got it. And most~ the people

down there, they could atleast get money to build another

house. But they did own - like I said, they owned the

land.

L

What was the year you were told to leave?

EA 56 or 57. Around there.

L

Was

to leave?

EA I had just scrubbed that buse from top to bottom. I had't been

prepared to move. Everything . .had just cleaned it from top

to bottom. (alughs) --they toldus to move, I could

have died. I literally had scrubbed it from the roof, the floors,

the walls. I wasn't prepared to move.

L

Scurbbd with a brush?

EA Yeah, with soap and water and a brush. they were wood homes,

you know.

Andihad just done it. That I do remember. I had just completely

cleaned that house frorn1Dp to bottm. And then1hey toldus to

leave. Ah ··· it was a clean house, that was for sure.

When we moved wt. We left a fut of stuff that we couldn't move.

AndIDrne of our firends said that aJot of people, right as soon

as left, came in to see what we had left. And I said, a clean house.

At least we can honestly say we left a clean house. But we were

not prepared to move. I think it was very very hard on my

Morn and Dad.

L

Why?

OH! E&G Aguayo 3-1 2-85 s2:13

EA They thought they were going t o spend their days there, forever.

You know. And I remmber my brother went a r o und looking for a home. And found

L

who? Gavino? Yes.

EA Went over a oouple of them. And oh, my mother, every :home, h e' d

say, well this is pretty good. It's this and that. She found

defect with everything. She just didn'·t want to move. There was a real

nice one down in Union. And !liked it. It was alittle farm house.

I think that would have been really nice. But my Mom, no she

didnt' want to be out there by herself. and all this.

GA

.. there was a nice little place - what now is Sandy. I wish I

had got in now becuase thatplace wouldhave been worth money.

It was about an acre and a half.

(they discuss this - not in Union)

(Sandy was the one EA liked) But - to have picked it. when we got this. It's a nice house
and a yard, but it isn't worth what that would have been

worth. Now. And the price, at that time, they still weren't --really worth that. You know, all 1hatki.nd of money.

EA I think my brother gave up taking us to see homes. Becuse when

he bought this, he bought it all on his oen. And I rernmember

telling him if you'regoing to buy · ahouse~ get one with with a

dining room. (laughs) I did not get a dining room·. He came

home and said, !think Ifound the house we're going to move

into. I said, does it have a dining room. He said, I don't know.

oh shoot .... He couldn't even remember£ it had a d i ning room. And

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s2:14

that was the only thing that I had asked for was a dining room.

I would haveloved a dining room. I've got a big kitchen.

Not a dining room (laughs) When we get together.

GA When we got this, I took over a mortgage that the people who

had it about a year before. 9,000 - I think it was 9200 and

the original one was 8000. Can you imagine a home 8000 bucks now?

Ohhh ....

L

Incredible.

GA ... that's w-y I say, that one down there with property. I

could kick myself - several times. ddddddd 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 h 1.J The

home was old--it was almost like the home that we had up in

EA? And it had a septic tank, that's what they didn't like about it.

GA

It wasn't on a line. It wasn't on a bus line. You know. It

had acerage. I forget how much. But it had some old barn--

not a barn but sheds or something. An old house. But that's

what gets me. It wouldhave been worth something now.

EA

But Mom didn'twant to move there. So she found fault with alot.

Everyone. We saw a couple in Midvale. And then he bought

thisone. Came ~out by himself one day, and came home and said,

I bought one. And I thought, oh, gee.

GA

we were getting close there.

EA

We were geiting close. They were cominginto move us out.

Time was getting close. What didyou think about geting out.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-1 2-85 s 2 :1 5

GA

It dind't bother me t hat much . You know. That ' s -- it's just

I guess, by then, I knew s ooneror l at er it was going to go.

L

How did you know ...

GA

Because the hill was expanidng, Itwas getting big . I didn ' t really

think deeply, but I thought oh well it will still be here for a

wile. But I really did thinkthat it was time - I think i f I had

been by myself or something like that, I'd probably have gotten out

sooner.

L

Left sooner?

GA

Yes, I think so. Becuase I think by that time, I think it wasn't

that good of an area. I remember, it ws cold in the winter. It was

a cold house.

EA

We wre all grown up by then.

L

Dcyou remember the day you left.

EA

It was Autumm.

GA

I can't remember.

- EA

we rented one. Gilbert Delatory rented us his truck. he drove it

down. It was a friend of my Dad's. DEL-

GA

DELLATORI

L

Sounds Italian.

GA

It's Italian.

EA

No, it's Mexican.

GA

I don't care what he says, It's Italian.

EA

He's Merican. He's from Mexico.

GA

Well, the name is Italian.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s2:16

EA

NO, he wasMexican. I remember that. He had a truck. And he

lent it to us. I remember becuase me and my mother came down on

the last loan. We stood til the very end. She didn't want to

leave.

L

What was your Dad's reaction to the move.

EA

Yeah, his ~s- ~srrore, how is he going to get to work. He was just

so afraid he had no way to get to work. And

- he really -had a hard time because everybody was more in car pools

My Dad did not drive andhe didn't have a car or anything. So my

married brother from Murray, he was living in Murray, would

come and pick him up every morning. Pick him up and take him to

work. And then when my younger brother started to drive, he would

drive him. Down to the Bingham hwy, then they would pick him up

there.

L

Down by the Moonlight.

EA

The moonlight. Then they'd pick him up. He had a hard time getting

transportation. Thatwashis main concern.

L

Main problem.

EA

Where before, hed just get up and catch the train and he was

--right at work. So.

GA

Yea, they had little coaches for them to ride along to particular

area s. Just go down to the school house. Like they had to go

far. And they had coaches and the coaches would bring you up and

down the hill. Andbring you back to the same spot ··

EA

And then my mother used to say about

in that area.

It was a very young community at that time. It was very young

couples, and there was no old people in this community. And she

didn't like it. When we'd go to church, she'd say, there're all

young kids. And they were.It was a very young .community when we

firstrnoved in. Now, I thinkair street here is allietirees. And

it's an adult commuity. our street here. Beucase I think everybody--

L

Everybody from fuat time almost.

EA

Yeah. all the kidsgrew up and~ft. But at the time my mother was

here - she would say, she felt so out of place. They were so young.

GA

The one's we got the house here, I don't think they were 21. The

ones thatlived ,across : the street.

EA

... young families .. all ...

·oidyou have any difficulties finding a house becuase you were

Mexican. AT the beginning.

GA

Not-not this one was proably was in more trouble becuase this

one did have, what do you call, covenants.

L

A restricted covenent.

GA

Restricted covenant. But it didn't meen nothimg. But as soon

as they offered, bey took it right off. becuase the seller wanted

to sell. So Butthis one here was theonly one I asked about that

had a restrictve convenant on it.

L

Doyou remember what it said.

GA

No. Not the wording. But that's what it was. Like I said,

I got it from a real estate, from down in oh I forget - he's

on state street but I forget his name. But he's the one that told.

He said this one has got one, butyou won't have no trouble.

I remember telling him I said, I don't even want to bother. You

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s2:18

know, if they don't want me to move in, I don't even want to

botherwith it. He said, naw, this is not--we'll go out there, see

if you likeit. Make the offer. And they were just like that. In

fact, they wouldn't even tell me how to oome until I asked the

people selling me, you know, I asked them about it one time.

Oh, we got it when we had it. (laughs) But it did have one.

_:a_ut _~hat~ _it. Theo~h~r ones, liker said, I didn't get as far as

going to the sellers to see,hlt the dealers never said antying

about them. But this one told.me rightoff thebat.

Yeah. So it was. I guess if this had been a more high tone area~,

It probably wouldhave been like that. But this was all ··.. just a

housing tract. They might have put it in ebcause alot of

other ~es had it. But it didn't really mean. IF you had tried to

buy on the east side, probably they had their's, they wouldhave

probably upheld them...

L

Did the two of you during the 50s, run into discriminatiqn .·.

GA

Idon't think. I know it was there. I say, even where I worked,

which has probably less discimrination than anywhere else, ah,

I knew it was there. And even if it wasn't spelledo.it, you knew

there were better jobs for Americans. And that t--when I come

GA

I don'treally know about the high

like that .

EA

Ah, Tess has always said, some k i nd of a t e st t hat they had at

work and he had the highest score. My brothe r , Alvino did . And

then a Japanese boy, oneof the Mocazokis had the second . And

then when my youngerbrother went, he topped his sco re.

L

Your name is Gavino. GAVINO.

EA

I remmeber everybody saying he had the highest score for a long

long time. Until -my yout1ger1Jrother went ahd then- he topped him.

GA

What I mean aboutscore--there's different ways. Like I know how

at times age restriction. You know, they put an age. To get an

:::_apprenticeship, you can't be ov:er 27. Well, that's becuase

there was proably someone 28 that was eligible for it. So if

thatrestrictionhad passed, theones at 21 - 22 would get it. Some-

time later, the restrictionWJuld be off. And they'd, finally

get it. But that man would find himself about 3 or 4 spots behind.

You know, original. And there was manuevers like that. And

where there was discrimiatio.n, which was part of it, a lot of

it was a part of favoritism. You know, if you know somebody, you

get it. You worked. You worked things. Andunions owrked that

way. But - ah, When it really started to- later theonly

discrimination was that _they would tell you things that when

you wre e ligible-. - Like alot of thepeople- I know likethat

missed opportunities for better work becuase they didn't

know about it. But where there's discrmination in a way,

c\\~o

,'"',e_,.J(.1

it was~ the fact that they ~bothered to find-to look

OHI E&G Aguayo 3012085 s3:20

to see where they were eligible.

L

Asse~t themselves.

GA

Yeah, because by then after the w~r. You know, it's written

on the contract, you know. Seniority, this andthat. And

they kept up to it. you know, ifyou pushed them Ifyou - didn't

allow the things to go in, you know, if you missed it and

then you'd try to coem back .. they'd always see, you didn't

apply. And thingslike that. A lot of people missed out on

thingslike that.

EA

Discrminatory wise, I don't think so. I don't think there was

much discrimination ...

GA

I think it was didfferent. It wasin a different way. But to

say you know that you can't - you can't have this because

you'reMExican. I don't think it eyer come down to that. But

alot of times, it worked the same way. You know, that - it

would comeait the same. But.

L

Just wasn't spelledait that way.

GA

Yeah, that's it. LiMeI say, tests, I never believe in tests.

I've had that-trouble with union officals allthe time. I-I-
always figured if a man passed a test to come n, then they

should forget about it. You know, _to come into the unit. Then

they shoulcbe forgotten about. For any other job. Becuase I never

believed there was anything up there that took thatruch

brains to do it. And it proved ~~~ecuase later on, you know,

after a man had been bypassed for along time, he ended up gettting

OHI E&G Agua yo 3-1 2 -85 s3: 2 1

the samejob, even t h ough h e was passed 50 . And he was still doing

the same thing excep t t hat he misse d that for a lot of years.

And see, Jecently whenthey 've been cut t ing back , it's finally

hurt them.becuase they didn't have the sneiority t o hold those

positions. A lot of them, like I say , mo st of it ,

I really wouldn't call discrimination in that sen se. But a lot

of it is just the idea of cliques, I think wouldbe more l i ke it.

Especially if you'rein a union clique, you're more l ikely to be

taken care cf.

L

What's a union clique.

GA

Well, anyone that. Ifyou attend, ifpu go. You haveto go. You

have to watch and see what everybody's doing. Make sure that nobody

goes aroundyou, this ' and that. Andifyou show up enough times,

people know better than to try that, do anything; because

you make trouble. SO you take-tha~-somebod¥ever shows up, never

bothers, if he misses something, nobody's going to tell.

He - he's missed± Our friend got it. Mostof it I think was

that. Ifit was - I don't know whether you'd really call it

discrimination. But it is - you know, it was unfair sometimes.

L

Intersting.

GA

You make it - you makd it fair. I know they had trouble like

_ _ _tha.t.._ Ri_ghtmw, it\s a bad time for that. For all their

seniority business. They say you're getting cut back. And alot

of them that had missed looking after thesmelves are now trying

to get it. And it's getting a little late. When it means y our

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s3:22

job and that ....

L

NEvertheless, you remember last time .. taling about security ·.

being a kennecott worker. Did you feel it.

GA

I always thought it was secure. Up til about 3 or 4 years ago,

I "1:>uld have sworn we'd have been there for another 50. I know

there's enough ore up there.But it never occurred tore that

it wouldn't worth it - thatit wouldn't be worth what it was

then. Actually, now it's 50 cents. And if you take inflation,

that's probably not getting what they got out during WWII.

L

·. If you go back to the years after the war, was a kennecott

job badly wanted in this area.

EA

Oh, you'd fight for it. Everybdoy was trying to get their

sons and your sons and their son-in-laws on. Andi£ you got on

Kennecott, you thought, you've got it made. I remember. when

my younger brother got on. h was out of high school one year.

He had gone up to the University. And then he decided he

didn't want to go into the university. He wanted a car instead

(laughs} And~ sister was still. We were living herein

Kearns then. My married sister was still in Bingham. And she called.

Cause she had just heard thatKennecott was going tohire. And to

get my brother1.p there. And.pay he went around - him and Joe Vladez,

his firend. they went up there and they stood andwaited

to get on for Kennecott. And if it hadn't been for my sister that

called down and said, hey, they.'re goingtohire. Becuase. they were

just waiting to get on Kenncott. Becuae once you got on Kennecott,

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s3:23

you thought you had it made. Yo uver e s et for life. You never

would have believed this wa s going t o happe n .

GA

You know, for all thatlength of time, from - s ay WWII til they

really

that we can remember, it p a id t he b est wages in

the state. I mean, it - and it kept getting better. Except for our strikes.

EA

And you survived those.

GA

Times were good. Times wre really good. I guess - I know that

even the people there now, they said, it's been three generations

for us. Andit'sbeen this good. It's just too bad that it's going now. But.

L

3 generations.

GA

Yeah. well, for some of them who had been there.

EA

ALmst us.

My Dad andyou and my nephew, Gavino too.

Three generations right there. And my other nephew tried to get

on but he was still going up to the university. But he wanted

part time at kennecott and he thought becuasehis Dad had worked

for ~nnecott. But he never got on. He just would never get him

on.

GA - Well at~ that time, bey had what you have now. Fair Employment.

That you have to go through the employment agency. And then

it not only had to be that your parents or somebody were working

up there, you had also to know the hiring boss up there.

L

Did you help your brother get the job?

GA

No I didn't.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s3:24

EA

My sister just called ... let him now. But my other brother

got his son on. Yes. Went to the foreman and all this maneuvering.

And. Got him on.

GA

I know when my Dad got the bb for my cousin who had come from

Mexico.

EA

That ws a disaster.

L

Why.

EA

He was a terrible worker.

GA

And went rightup to the supintendent. At that time, you could

go talk to the ·superintendent . . .

EA

He came one day and he was working two days later for Kennecott.

L

Illegal.

GA

An illegal.

L

Just got in and started working.

EA

My Dad got hima job.

GA

My Dad went up and talked to the superintdent. My nephew . . .

EA

Relatives likethat we did not need. He was just not a good

worker. He just wasn't used to work.

GA

You'd think all mexicans have worked all their lives. I don

think he had.

EA

He couldn't work. He just like to~-it was a total disaster.

My DAd used to say it was my Mom's relative. ·,!laughs)

Needless to say, he didn't last long. he got pickedup by the

immigration. And then they felt like we shouldhave helped him.

And we thought let them take him ... (laughs) We didn't help.

L

Was he sent back?

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s3:25

EA

Yea, but he came back. He came b a c k . He never cameback to Utah.

But, he in fact is still in the state s . He called me about a

year ago. I said, Stay away. 'J.l a ughs ) But my Dad got him on. He could-it was a good job. It wa s a tota l dis a ster o u r

only relative was a total disaster for us

L

But you could influence - someone to get on. You knew who t o t a l k

to. Didn't have to go through the channels.

GA

I know.

The one I was tellingyou about who quit a year

--Wally Swenson. Now, he's from Urica. He didn't have anyone

up hre except inlaws. Now he had an inlaw-Albertsons were his

inlaws. But he used to come up here day in and day out.

He used to say--that's when the old Bangbergerused to run

from Lehigh up to Salt Lake Valley. Up :to here. And then

he'd catch the bus to here. But he used to ride that little

old train-he was from Eureka. And with people from around

Provo. But he'd ride that thing all 1he way upi here, day after

day. Trying to get on l And he'd alwys used to blame it on--

it was McFarland was --he was the one who'd done the hiring.

But I guess pesonnel manager. But he used to do the hiring. And

he was a man looking man. I mean, if people had to -- now, I

didn't- have to hire fr0mhikm because at that time, WWII, they

needed help, so Ijust wentup and signed the papers. But people

- used to go up anafii~e - they said he'd just pick and choose.

YOU-GO HOME. You know~-you forget it. And Wally used to say

he'd show up for months at a time before they finally h i red him.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s3:26

L

He'd show up every day.

GA

He said he showed up every day. Every day he'd come up.

EA

And he worked for 40 years to that.

GA

He had one more year when he quit. So he had 43 years. when

he quit last year. He had a lot of time.

L

Soundslike Kennecott was really kind of alittle world onto

itself.

GA

At--that time. It was. Later on, like I said, when tt.hey started

making them hir.e

with no discrimination, then you

had to go through ..... emoloyrnent (job service) and then they

had no more control. I guess they still did have it. Becuase

they 'd send them from there but you still had a better chance

if you knew somebody. But still, then they started getting

from all over. They done their own. That's why I think-~

everybody more or less knew everybody. because everybody

lived around there.

L

And everybody's uncle, relative or some distant relation ...

GA

Yeah, all worked in ther. But it was sort of a - it was a one

company town. And that ... and later, when they got big and got

taken over and had to start changing. And later eventhan that,

when they were forced to hire, you know, accordin9 to
r · - yoff appTlcation. OU- were supposed tohave. Yout-put -a:1-1--

your names as you get in and you get to the bottom one, you

know. But then there's still enough stories to know that that

didn't happen. And you know,this E somehow some name got pulled

that wasn't in line. I guess they done it ~legally not so they

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s3:27

L

They didn't get into too much trouble fromit.

GA

And alot of them1hat come up, they didn't know what number they

were or anything so if they didn't get --

L

There wasro way of knowing, of checking it out. No. so you were

here in about 56-57. And who moved here. Your parents andyou two and who else.

EA

We were mostly all home yet.

GA

Except for a sister and brother ..

EA

That weremarried. And it was me, my brother, and the two youngest,

Dolores and Ed~ard. And Rebecca had just left for nursing train-~±ng.

So she didn't really oome in, move in with us. So it was the two

youngest. And the -us two.

L

Andyour mother got ill soon after you were here?

EA

Yeah, she got, 2 or 3 years later-she -She wasn't sick. She

got very suddenly kind cf a couple of months and took her.

She had a brain tumour. Took her real fast.

end side three

begin side four

EA

we were all going to go. And we took two cars. Saved all our

money for that vacation. We were all going to go for a month.

Except for my brother - he never -- I even took my one

---

- ----

- - - - - - -· - - - - - -

newphew with me. And he was young. He was about 7 years old. And

I used to babysit him and so I took him along with me

at the time I took him to Mexico with me. And it was right after

that, after we had been to Mexico. All1he whole family. When we

got back, she died. She was starting to be sick. She just wasn't

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s4:,S

well. That was the hst we were all really together. We came

back, we went on strike. My sister had lost her scholarship for

the University. She was .inthe last year at th a.Jniversi ty. My ·.other

sister had given up her job. (Laughs) We spent all that money

to be tourists ofr a whole month. I remember that. Really.

I remember I went to work. I hadn't worked. ButI went to work.

My sister was in her last year of college and we needed (money)

and we were on strike. And I remember my mother was sick at that

time. It was hard.

L

Was she the firstperson thatwas really sick in her family.

EA

Yeah, well, she was - she couldn't manage the house anymore.

She ould't-completely by herself. She hadn't done it. I'd

alwys been around. That year, I decided well I better go to work

to help my sister out. And I told, her, just as soon as. she gradu-

ates, I'll quit. Which I did. Just as soon as she graduated,

I quit. Sol could be home here with her. And then she died.

L

You took care for her.

EA

Yes. She died. Yeah. But it was hard. That one time. Becuase

we came back and we were on strike, and my sister had lost her

scholarship. My other sister had given up

her job. (laughs) Oh, gee. That was really. They just

didn't expect all of this to come down on us.

L

What affectdid ymr mother's death haveon thefamily.

EA

I think that was hard on me becuse we were together a long time.

And death - the first one we lost.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s4:J.9

GA

That's what I can remember mostly-it was the firstirour family.

EA

And it was sudden. We did not e xpect i t. I t came too quickly .

We didn;t expect it. You know, with my Da d, i t k ind of worke d

up to it. You never prepare yourself t o it. butjOU kind of . You

say, hey, it can happen. It might happen. But with my

Mom it was boom-boom, all of a sudden it was there.

And thento boot, when my Dad died, we lost my Dad, the last

part of December, my uncle the third of march andw brother-

in-law the 19th of April. I didn't think we were going to surviv

another death in this family. It just lit us. bang-Bang~ybang

it came so sudden to us. Andit was hard. We - I remember our

friends would come over and they'd say, how - you poor girls,

how areyou going to survive this. And we said, we survive. But

my mother's was hard becuase it was first. And sudden. I think

hers hit me real hard It was hard. It was hard.

L

Was± hard for you too.

GA

Yes, like Isay, the firstone was always--I didn't really

expectthat in be family like that.

EA

Shw asn't thatold. She was 60. 60.

GA

No one you could say - is going to go. I think that was --

you're really not prepared for anything like that. The first one.

I knew everybody

died and things like that, but that was

the firstone in ours.

L

Didyou mourn. Do youIEmember mourning.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s4:30

EA

Yes, I did. God, that was bad. I - My mother shook me real

hard. I think I was closer to my Mom than I was to my sisters.

And. It was hard.

L

Did you - Do you wear black when you mourn.

EA

Yes. Yes, we wore it. Wore it for three months.

L

Do you cover mirrors,

EA

No.

-We-wear- bl-ack. My-- sisters though t I was silly but to me, that

was something I had to do.

GA

Theaistom- they started changing.

EA

Yeah, even Chin came up to me and told me not to do i t but

this was personal. And - I don't take advice very well. (laughs)

But I eventhink I'd do it for my godmother becuase I'm very close

to my godmother.

L

What made it so imporant to wear black.

EA

Becuase she believed in it. And Ibelieve. It's part of the

mourning. And my mother was a true believer in this. And I felt

it was just alittle more something for here, if nothing else.

But. I don't expect nobody else to do it. ANdeveyrbody can do

their own thing. But I'm going to do mine. This is what I told

my sisters.

EA

NO. You do what you want and I'll do what I want. But don't tell

me what I'm going to do. Which they didn't. Which is fine. They--

I don't say their mourning was any different than mine.

OHI E& G Aguayo 3-1 2 -85 s4:31

Im sure they did it too. But, I f i t hadn ' t been for my little

newphew. And Tommy was t h ree. I do n 't t hink I coudl have survived

that year. But I was taking care of h im and he was in the house

with me. And I wasn't alone. And it's - i t pul led me through ,

I think. And I always tell him that.I don't k now wha t I wou ldhave

done without him. He's 25 years old now and I stil l say I cou ldn ' t survive without him.

L

Doeshe looka t you puzzled when you tell him.

EA

No, he understands. He was a good little boy. He knew. and then

when my Dad died, like IS3.y, he was sick. And Ithink I spent half

my time up at LDS hospital with him Plus the time my brotherin-law was sick too. SoI'd take him and then I'd come

back and I'd take my brother-in-law to the hopsital. They '\ere

1:oth so sick. Liker say, they died within a couple of months

of each other It was a hardtime.

L

Did the men mourn.

GA

I didn't-- Inot like

I-- Not ah I don't know whether

whether they would have done it -or if we had been.:in1he old

I didn't think that was appropriate. You know, I think mourning's

all right .. Like htat. But. I don't think it was --that

it's really necessary in that way. I think about the only way ,

liker say, like Es said, that you do it for them. Th at's

I don't think -It's really passed.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s4:32

EA

It has. You go to funerals now and very few do it. Even the older

people don't do it any more. (mourn in black)

Even the church isn't draped in black anymore.

Well, the father would come in black vestments. Ah, bey had

and now they don't they wear the white. For, like they say, the

joyful. becuase it's a joyful time. And I remember Father

Mer

, he was our P_?§_t__s,r_!._~en. And Ji~ lelp~d the family a lot

through this. Hard tikme. And in fact, he was with mother

when she died. And that's before we even knew him. And then he

was assigned to our parish. And I remember thefirst time I met

him, he said, to us, I know you. I was with your mother

when she died. And Fatehr Mer_ _ . at the ti.me, he was mt our

pish priest. He just happened to be at the cathedral at the

time. Mother died at LDS hopital. And He says, I remember your

family quite well. And he helped us alot. And I remember

his saying one time that death was a joyful - becuase--and I

said to him, tlel me that when your mother dies. But don'tyou

tell me right now. And when his mother died. I would have loved

tohave said this. But I didn't say a word. becuase it's different

when± hits you.It's good to say it - don't do that - wait til

it hits you and then see kow you react. That's the way I feel. Becuse

it' s a lrd time ,

GA

You read about Father Meirsman. He's in a lot of this prison--

EA

Yea, he was the chaplain of the prison. In fact he did that

-- Gary Gilmore movie (laughs) with him. He' was the chaplain.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s4:33

Beautiful person.He really is. He's really. Like I said, he helped

the family. and he was with us when thect:.her deaths of the family occurred.

L

He helped you then.

EA

He relaly helped. ... But I remember tell him, when you

Morn dies, you ~11 me how you act .. Until she dies. Don't

tell me how to ..

L

You're a deceptive person. You know. I have to tell you this.

After listening to you. There's so much playfulness and

lightheartednes.s baout you. but you' re ,1also very serious.

EA

I guess.

L

Both of you have this quality in some ways.

Very nice to see it...... it's a whole other dimension to you as

a person.

EA

Trying tobe truthful.

L

You are ...

So did tings in the louse change after your mother died. Did life

change?

GA

I don't think so.

EA

It didn't either because mostly I had already taken over most

of the household thing. The cooking, the cleaning.

L

You became the person who ran the house.

EAI

had done most of it. I had already started it anywya. And

thre's a few things that I didn't really - Like the first time

I did tamales, All by myself. I stood there and I looked.

And it's different

andhave somebody therehelping you than go

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s4:35

s

you than go ahead and to ityourself. You know ·. And another

time my Dad wanted sorne .·.. it's like a gravy color thing-- I don't

know what it'scalled rightrow. But my Dad wanted some and I told

him I'd make him some. I put the pan on the stove andfound

out I didn't know how. I had no idea how to do it. That's

~ first realization that hey I didn't know how to do that. I had

never learned. My mother had always made that. And she had made it

for my Dad. Becuase he liked it. See. And I remember going in

san saying, sorry about that. I don't know how to make it.

So I calledII!{ Godmother up. And said, Morn you maynot believe

htis but I don't know how to make this. And I can't remember what

you called it. But mostly I had taken over thelousehold and

my youngerbrothers and sisters more or less alreadt. And they weren't

that young anymore.But. Then my younger brother joined the

service a few days afterrnother died. And I think that was a big
blow too, to lose everybody a: the same time. He decided.

In fact, he called me up and said, I'm leaving. I said, hey, gees,

let something settle down before something else-- And he

went into the service. That was lard. All of a sudden, it seemed

to me everythingwas falling apart All of a sudden you're losing

control. And my Dad was no help after my mother died. He was

just devestated.He was just lost. Competely lost. He just couldn't

adjust without my mother. he miss-d her an awful lot. And I

couldnt fillthat~lacethat he had with her. And Irremember becaus

he retired and sometirneshe'd get up grouchy, real groucy. And

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s4:36

I said, what did I do. I didn't do nothing. It was just that

he was · lonely. he was a very lonely person at that time. He tried

going to Mexico. And that didn't work out ... · . He didn't stay

very long And then he'd come back and he was just tyring to find

himself without mymother. And we couldn't fill that place up. We couldn't fill it. It's hard.

L

That is hard.

EA

It's hard.

L

Somany times, I've heard that story. One of the - husband or

wife dying.

EA

Yeah, theyv'espent too many years together. And they're just

lost. My mother was always afraid he'd die before her. Because

shed always say, what would I do. And - she died before him.

So maybe God knew what he wasdoing. I don't know.

But we surived. We survived.

L

Did you like this areas when you moved in here?

GA

I don't--

It was all right.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 sS:37

L

... you first did not go into the machine shop. You went into that

later on. How did ou get into that job.

GA

You just bid into it. Bids come out. Openings, you wonder -

when they call them. You put a bid in. I tried, like I said,

I tried first the carpenters. I didn't like that. I tried.

ThenI went to .the machine shop. And I stooa there · all the rest

of time time.

L

How is taht interms of work.

GA

Maybe mostly, it was ... greasy. You know, it's --

EA

You went into welding.

GA

Yeah, but that was still the machine shop. What I'm thinking

of - the mechanical department is what I should say. But I went

as a helper. In what they call repair gang, working with shovel

you know, big electric shovels. But grease is what (laughs) what

you mostly get out of it.

L

What was the Esponsibility of the machine shop. What were you

guys supposed to do?

GA

-like I say, when I was down there, before I was a wlder, a journey

man, it was as a helper. Mostly,at thattime, you still had

machinissts and then theyhad helpers. It was only to recent

years th~t they got rid of the helpers and everybody does the

same--just machinist. At thattime, you just helped andyou cleaned

up, clean upi tools. Done the work for them. He said, you turn

this wrench this way. You turn it. Andyou · just wait there until

another bid comes out for apprenticeship somewhere. At that time,

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-1 2 -85 sS:38

there really wasn't tha t movement. Ah .

L

What was the work of the ma c h ine s h op .

GA

Oh, be whole machine shop itself , you f i x locomotives, which is

--not only with l

and drill presses and eve rything like that.

Youhad aboiler maker shop that done all their wo rk- d o all

the fabricating, whatever, mostly like building things like - we

called them shacks, cause they're little houses or -whatever .

Riveting, you know, welding and all that. And then you had

an electrical shop that's down here rewinding a· motor. At that

time, they used to rewind their - electric ·:motors and all that.

Everything tat's in a regular machine shop. Like I said, lathes,

nails, ah whatever it takes to turn metal - you know, t omake

things. Like blacksmith shops. To make all the tools we made.

Chisels. Spikes. Not spikes with the buggy bars. Things like

whenever you had to work with bend metal or to straighten out.

Everything up there as big as a yard, they get bent at some time

or another. Youhave two trains hitting togehter and they'll bend.

Which happened alot of times. So you take everything apart. You

straighten them ~t. You put them together. Thingslike that.

The same thing with the shovels. The shovels wear out, you put

in new bearings,you put in new rollers, you put in new dipper

S(tips. The bucket itself, you know, the one that picksup the

girds-saw is getting wore out. Have to realign --

L

You pretty much try to keep the whole thing running - that was

theresponsibilty~

GA

Not mine-but yeah, with all the shop, you do. My job was actually

just to repair them. The shovel part. The big s hove ls. That was

OHI E&G AGuayo 3-12-85 sS:39

well, you had little odds and ends.Like we used to take care of

the little trolly that ran up to the office. They had a little

car that goes up on a cable. We used to have to go up and- when

the cab;e would get worn - chop it off, put a new one. Then we'd

have to go down to what they callthe precipitating

plant, fix the fans and ventilators up at the top. Fix the

littel scoops that pick up the ore. Whatever-alot of different

things like that. And. Gather together - the other parts of

the machine shop would do what they had - which was mostly -

On the other side of the shop was to fix the locomotives. To

fix all the iailroad·::equipment. The little railroad cars taht they

had. Even at that time, they didnt' have too many regular trucks,

cars, there wasn't that much mostly everything was

at that time. Now, eerything's on rubber tires. You know. (laugh)

That's what it was. And thenfrom there, I got a bid to the

welding department. And there, you just - you weld the things shut.

So it is- you burn them,you weld them, you fix them.

L

The same big shovels.

GA

Yeah.

L

But a different job.

GA

Well,a welder would work on anything. I mean, lke I say, when I

was a helper and _as a repair ga~~ we just worked on shovels. But

when you're a welder, you work on either the shovels or the locomotives

or whatever. You know. Thenafter later on, when bey opened up

up the big truck~~~~~~' up the Yosemite. That's proably where

I spent more of the time. And then you end up there as a machinist.

And then there mostly you worked on - mostly thebig trucks up

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 sS:40

there. Thosebig - 150 ton t r ucks . A lot of service-equipment.
2, There's alot of - antying froma ton to ton trucks . A lot of

those trucks runningaround. In fact, all foremen run - they give

them all one-ton trucks. You know, the y must b e oh 1 00 of those

one-ton trucks running around the hill. But and maybe a n o t h er--

well, at least that many ,if you count all the other - the

other types of trucks. The lube trucks, repair trucks, and

--all that other type. That's mostly the end that I worked 01.

Mostly service trucks. Repairing ... Then I went to rebuild them.

And there, you fix the components. Actually, you rebuild the

engines. You rebuild the transmissions. Rebuild alot of little

tings. Pumps. Alternators. Carburators. Thingslike that.

That's where I ended up as--

L

Finally?

GA

Yeah.

L

Howbig was the wholemachine area. Shop wise-in terms of

people--

GA

oh, I think alike the size of a large gymnasium.

Ah, you know, maybe 100 yards, 150 years, you know square

building. But then there was a lot of them up there. That was th

the machine shop at Dry Fork that

we'd

then there was a - uptown, up in Bingham, it's

. Dry Forks. And -- there's

a

shop up there. And you know (laughs) The machine shop

was the biggest one. And that's where they had - they had the

most people working. But there were other - oth er shops all

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 sS:41

over the place.

L

Whatdi(¥oU learn best about the work you did. Did you like?

GA

I think - I liked the work. I liked the work.

L

Whatdidyou like about it.

GA

(laughs) I don't really know what you can say= what I liked

mostly when I was welding is that you're by yourself. Andyou don't

w_prk w.ith__ anypo_dy_ else. And noone tell syou what to do. I mean, .:,.

when you putt that hood down,

I could practically weld and go to

sleep. (laughs) You know, again there's not the (ilaughs)

now, that part ·1 thought would

(laughs)

It's a - I-I I enjoyed the job. When I spent a lot of time on the-

what we call service - working the service equipment. You know,

q most of that,most of that is pulling engines in and out. You ·~ ; 'you 1ta:«e one ending¢ o~ and you put another - newer-0 ?ebuilt

one in. You fix the brakes on it. You fix thelights. Whatever.

IT's different. you know,every dyarn it. And-it's like I

say-- it's anoher time, you work mostly by yourself. I fyou need

help, you go get help. And it isn't a big crew. You set your

own pace. When you fix a truck, whe you take it out over the

hill for a dive, you know it's - (alughs) -

L

'l'est driving.

GA

Test driving. Yeah. (laughs) You take

driving. Time

goes. It goes good. And you do learn something. They--

I know there's alot of people in the valley teat w~;re really

qualified mechanics, you know. But - ah, some of us, you know. you

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-1 2 -85 sS:4 2

- we learn alittle here and there. You know when you S.Pend

taht much time.And wi.en we do - we ll , Ishouldn't say, "we do"

now, but we used to - I u s ed t o 60 it. A lot of work at the--

I don't think there's a ga rage i n t own t hat couldthat ' s pulledout

as many engines as we have.

Or t hat' s ev en r epaired as many

as I have. We've taken the 3:50

e n gi n e, ~ which i s mo s t

common in a car. It used to be before the gas crunch - and they

started going to thelittle ones. But, we used to fix altest

one week. Youknow,there'alwys one on a stand. One Chev, One

Ford -

stand on there allthe time. Youlearned alot about

the work on there. (laughs)

L

Is there something inparticular thaty:,u didn~t like about the

job? Some aspect of the work--

GA

I never ld.k-d it when I got the same thing day after day

beciefase there was a hard one. I never liked that. And I

know one time, I blew up at the bs s becuase I got four transmissions
in a row. Andihese are transmission on atleast 21 ton trucks.

They're automatics. And they'rebig. And they're dirty. I mean,

you'd have to disconnect the - a lot of holes - there's alot

of rods. It's hard. That was hard work. And I finally got tired ot it.

I told _hiln ,. · ···' no more, that's it. You give these to somebody

else. laaughs)

That was

old B.

Oh gosh.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 sS:43

He just retired too this year.

EA

come down to my hob.

GA

He goes down -

EA

Hes always asking about him and telling me to tell him hi. And

I'll tell him, you know that man that comesin. He said to say

hello.

GA

I woked with Bi

a -. long time BALETKA. Actually. He's

honky. I think. Yugoslav. He's a hunkly. He used to do it like

that. I was a good worker. The foreman or it seems anyone

else, you know; they say, you work a horse to death if it'll do

it. He knew I'd do the job. sohe'd keep - you put somebody

else there,they'd stay there for a week and they'd never

~~~-· BUt I fianlly got tired of him and toldhim. And he com

over and apologized. I wasn'ttrying to really put it to him. That's

just the way it happened. Well, I got tired of it. But every once

in a while, that happenslike that. That's about theonlything

is that the-if you think that they're picking on you, justliek

anyting else.

L

But you ahve to know.

GA

Well you have -- you go for -- I'd probably let hikrn go longer

than a lot - because I don't really - it really wasn't that

bad. But every once ina while, I'd say, that's---

L

Well, where did you learn to take care of yourself. To tell people

to

where did you learn that?

OHI E& G Aguayo 3-12-85 sS:44

GA

I've alwys said thatp:-obably the best experi4nce I everhad

was in the army. becuase I did learn there to take care of

myself. AndI think a lot of it's carried over. It's -

Justlike everything else, when thre's no one around todepend

on, except yourself, youlearn quick. (alughs) But I never really

had not rouble at the hob like that As I said, I've alwyas been,

I think even if you talk tothe foreman up there, r -think they'll

tell you that I was eonsidered a good worker. I never laid off. Every once

in a while.

AEI

I don't think you ever took a sick day ever.

GA

That' why I had so much. You know, whenI had sick leave and

all that. Even when they first started, you a:>ubd't accumulate ie.

If you took it, youknow, if you did take it, you lost it.

Well, I lost some of that first because I - get laid off.

You know, I wasn't sick. And I didn't - I wasn't

or anything like that.But everyone thought I was

nuts and then when I started accunulating, of course, later on,

when bey'd seen - you know, when I - when I quit and I had 100 or something days - rt was 14,000 dollars. I thought, maybe I should have saved

some (laughs) But I never --I

L

You didn't think youwere so crax-.

GA

No, whenthey see that it accumulates. Alot of them used to tell

me, you better take it. They're going to get rid of it. Well maybe

OHI E&G AGuayo 3-12-85 sS:45
they will then, bit I endedup with -It's a - (aughs) But I think like I said, if a three day weekend or someting was coming. And if I had to go to work on a Tuesday and I'd been wt Sat. and Sunday, well I'd lay off moneday too, you know, turn in sick. They'd give-pu four days. O Or soemthing like that.Butit wasn't that often Sometimes a holiday comes in - right in the right spot where you can make a long-

L

Did you feel a commitment ot the company. To work.

GA

I think I did.Either a commitment ot the company or it was just

the ±lea that I figured they're paying me. And I owed them that much.

And they weren't really treating me bad or anyting.

I always felt - I think I've always been a good worker up

there for them. Like I aid, r ' kind of figure I owed them at

least that. You know. I said, I was always the -- point where
Iwould let htem. Youknow, £f someting was unsafe or something __

like that, I wouldn't go to thatpoint.

Like I keep thinking

awout theseniners, you know that got caught down that mine.

oow if it really was happening that they ~reon production or

something like that andthey had somehting- they let something

go, that's going allite bit too :1.r, just for money. Yo know, if

there was anyting like that. That they let that go by it.

I wouldn't-thre's a lot of times when I refused to do something.

Andmost of the times, they'd agree You know, they're more liable to get

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 sS:46

end side five begin side six

with somebody that--

GA

.. thingslike when you're using cables and things like that.

When those new trucks first started corning up, ah, I never

worked on them without putting ties under the - under the

I don't know if you've seen a picture of these, but the beds

will come up just like a dump truck. Except they're real big.

And they tell you if you go off center, they can't get back.

down. Well, I never believed them, and I still don't that they won't come down this way. And I always told them, I won't work

on that until -- but sometimes, they'd say, all youhave to do.

They had stand pipes. They eitherput pipes on little things

that hold up the bed like that. And I would never trust them.

I always thought, what if that thing come down. And I always took

the time to put ties underneath the hinges where they go back.

Even if it goes back, it's going to hold that long enough for

me to get out. You know, it's only going to be for a little

bit.

L

Do you know people up the~e that got hurt~

GA

Not like that. Not like that. I think there's been people that

got hurt for similar things. But ·.. well, I really can't remember

any incidepce like that.But I just assumed. Mostof the time

the accidents happen - it's just dumb things. Not for something

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s6:47

They don't - it's always been a practiceq:> there, if ·you follow

it. Thatyou don't work unsafe. You know. The company - I- ...

foremen will sometimes try to push something .. that isn't.

Like I don't know how many electricians have gotten killed before

they finally learn to lock up those boxes where nobody could

throw switches. You know, before somebody would throw a switch.

Someone .. else would come by and wonder why taht switch was down,

he !.d turn it up. And somebody woul dbe working on the line. That'

happened before. I remember a long time ago, well, when Ifirst

started working. Well, they fhrew a switch. Why did they throw

a switch_Well, they thought they~re done. Something like that.

We used to have the railroad trains, the trolleys, so when they

blast a trolley, -a tower would go down.

So an electrician

would have to go up,

Put the tower back up. Put the wire. And

the switches were at the end of the Evel. Well, the only way you

had to communicate then was by whistles. Train whistles.

Something like that. So one man would go up to the end of the

thing, throw the switch down. Theother one would go down there,

conenct them up there. And the --mistakeswould happen. They'd

throw a switch on. They got caught alot of times like that.

Now, electrician goingt owork, he puts alock on the box.

And he's got the key and he unlocks it when it's done.

IT took a awhile but it's never - what they say, you had to work

on it. Just the fact that no communication. There was no- between

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s6:48

themselves. They assumed thatit was closed. You know.

I understand.

Sounded like it was the kind of place where you really had to look after yourself.

GA

Any time you get that much equipment. It's just a wonder that

more accidents didn't happen. Another time. When Iwasa welder

one time, I was welding ~the gas tank. Now-it's taboo. At that

time, you cleaned it with water . ... torch on.it. one time. And

the darn thing explosed.Like they do. You know, gasoline. Nothiing

happened. But now, in act, you're not even allowed to work on

them. They throw them away. But at that time. You still tried to

work on them. Later, they -- you put into it some kind cf inert

gas andyou tried to work on them. Even now, on these big trucks,

they're still welding on them But'they're diesel. And diesel

isn't as explosive as that. But sometimes I .even wonder about

them . . . You weld on them, by either some kind cf inert gas like

nitrogen. Or you know, drain it all out and wash it.

Put water in it and wash it like that. Diesel isn't. But

I think alot of it is dangerous. I remember when we first

opened the shop up in Yosemite. The first one that got killed

up there-I forget his name -but he ·was working on a grater

L

What's a grater.

GA

Just like these that work on the roads, with a blade in the middle.

Thebig machines that will push dirt to the side, you know. But

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s6:49

with the blade some where h the mddle, with an angle. That's

a grater. On the road, on construction you'll see them. Well, he

was workingm there. And he clirnbedup and it was running and

he went to climb down and he hit the gear shift. And it threw

him off, right under the wheels.Now, bat was right under--

right in the shop. About the first year that shop opened in

Yosemite. And he was the first one who got killed up there.

It was a dumb thing. That's usually the way you go. Now everyone

knows, you don't work on machines when they're- whenthe engines

on. Andit's not blocked. You know. It didn't have nothing

under the wheels to hold it. But I think at that time, I said,

it was a new shop, new men. Butit's a lot of times, j--

L

Just carelessness.

GA

... if it never appened. You talk to my brother. NOw, him and

Joe almost got - that one day, whenthe bed come down. A hose

busted. You know, a hydraulic hose. IT has those big pistons

that push the truck. Sothey had to pi_·~ -

up.

They had to do something. Now, I think my brother was sitting

in the cab and Joe was down there somewhere and all of a sudden

a hose broke and the bed just come down. Well, none of them

was hurt. My brother said, he bounced his head up and down

on the ab. But if they had been underneath there whenthat

thing- you know, whenthat wholebit.

How did Chick get hurt. It was a stupid thing he did.

GA

.. That . ~.. He was try ing t o sta rt the truck that you put ether

in.

EA

Boy, that thing blew up in his face.

GA

Ether - alot of ether is used in the winter. A lot of people

have gotten more or less burnt by putting ether in t h e carburator .

That thing backfires. And before they can get rid of even the can

or whaterver they're using - either er gas - it probably burned his face.

But I noticed several - I know several people that's gotten

burned by putting ether in the carburator. Or even the intake-the big ~rucks have some big round filters .about two-feet

round and rriaybe about a yard - three feet long. But they stick

in front of the truck. The air filters.

Where the --

So to start in fue winter, you squirt ether in each one of

thosefilters. Youknow, intake filters. It comes through

them too, whenthe exhaust, it comes through there. (laughs)

I know several that's gotten - either if it isn't fire - it's

all be dust that comes rut of those filters and just sprays

their faces. But there's alot of equipment rut there. Usually, though the

only ones that get killed has been on those big trucks when

they've gone to sleep. That's usually the big danger. Those

big trucks, when they're loaded with dirt. They must weigh

200 tons I guess because they're 150 tons and they're always loaded

right up as far as they go. Andusually, that night shift,

that last shift, especially if a man's working an e xtra j ob --

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s6:51

which a bt of people used to do-because that's the reason alot of them used to like that - alot of them used to like the night shift. They do that They go up there and they fall asleep a little

or just lose conscious a little, you know. have the truck

rollin a bank or something. There's been several like that killed

on the trucks.

They fall all the way inside the pt.

GA

No.

The truck rolls on to them.

GA

That's all they've got to do - the truck rolls ever them. Even

the fall fromthosethings, those thingsmust be 30 feet high. Fromthe driver's. Even that with the banging. You know wouldbe enough ... There's alot of equipment there. ~t's just amazing tome that more
haven't gotten hurt. I remembercne time when I was checking the timing of an engine. And it was close to quitting. And that's usually whenthe dumb things happen. You get ready to go and

you're in a hurry. And Iwanted to finish this truck before I went home. So I'm trying to find the timing locks. I don't know
whither you know anything about engines. You set the engine to the mark. To turn the distribute.rs to be right in line to where you want it, the next one to fire .... Byt hen, I had everyone

helping me because they were geting ready to go home. so

I had one man in 1he cab. And

hit button to start, to turn

the fan, to find the number.AndI keep saying, hit it, hit it. And

alot of the .time I never said nthing, lmt he was used to

hit it. And I didn't say nothing andI put my hand down there to

OHI E&G AGu ayo 3-1 2 -85 s6:5 2

check something. And h e hit it. And I didn't say nothing . And it

took my glove and the thing right un der the fan belt. Wel ...

(Whistles) if it had started, it would have probably just took

the hand right off. But the only thing it n ever s t arted . He

just hit it. But it got enough to grab my glove over the p u lley .

Little dumb thing like that. (laughs) I can remember that.

Hit it, Hit it, hit it. And one time, I never said hit it. And he hit it! Oh ...

L

It's scary .·

GA

... we've had several mashups. One time, a truck come in. We

used tohave rest rooms down below. You know, on the main

floor. We had, I remember, one time a truck come in. I don't know

what happened. The guy's foot slipped er something. Now,

you're talking about big trucks. ~heyre monstrous things. The

tires are about 11-12 feet.High. Just the tires. And then you've

got a truck sitting on that. Anyway, he come brough. And for

some reason, he never stopped. And he hit that rest room·.

And ther estroom was just a concrete block with a big slab of

cement. Over the top. he ran right through that restroom there.

And that slab come down. And I remember everybody running around

to see if there was somebody in it. Didn't know at that

tiem, if you're running a~ound with equipment like that. It's always. It's caught several people, you know. .... It

mashed - one I know, it mashed his ribs. He's in here guiding

it. Come in come in Come in. AndlE never noticed alon g side of

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s6:53

him that he had one of those big diesel engines ready to

go in.Now, bey're monstrous things about maybe 15 feet long.

And they'renot going to budge. And .he kept you know, like this.

And the thing jumped and he was between the truck and the

engine .on the floor (that's what they were getting ready to

put in) Now, it broke his ribs and hurt him internally. Things

like that. But ...

What happened to a guylike thatin Kennect. What was his fate.

If you don't get well, it's a disability. You get - regular -

The lever come bsck and smacked him.

About the only thing that's happened to me. That was it. I had

to go down to the clinic twice that I can remember. One time

when _Iwaspulling an engine. Ah, out of a truck. I forgot that

it was an automatic transmission. They weigh more. They're heavy. and I was taking the last bolt out. And I took - the

engine - and the transmission split like this and the trans-

mission got my finger. And I thought it tore it off. In fact, it was this one. It took of a chunk like this. Where this

mark is. But I thought± cut it off. And I remember just looking at it and I was wondering why_doesn't it hurt. You know, it didn't hurt. becuase you know, I guess when you mash them,

they - maybe they don't hurt or something like that. But that

- that was one time that it did~'t. And that's just another orie of those - you don't pay attention.I shouldhave_!:locked the transmission up so that when I took the last bolt out, it didn't flip. And caught my finger. Another time, that's when I was a helper, I wasusing a and grinder to grind some things. And it was one of those jobs - welder -- that you could practically sleep. And that's practically what I was

doing. I got myself a little.-!bench just even with what I was - working andI was working and grinding like this. Half asleep,

not paying- much attention or anything. And I'd run it overrny leg. - Run that grinder off that table and get down above

my knee. The grinder. I was using a grinder. It was grinding

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s7:55
something Ihad welded, that was too high, too much. just cut it off with the hand grinder. Just, you know, half a sleep. Half my mind. My mind somewhere else. But I remember that. The doctor had to spend some ume digging out cause the grinder picks up a lot of little grease things. He kept pulling but I said, that's about the extent of mine except for mashed fingers and thingslike that. There's alot of machines you can get hurton. There's been alot of people that's - I think mostly though like I said, the truck drivers and electricians, they've
lost mrelives I think. Electricians. That's a dangerous. I don't care. You'rehandling all that wire. Like I say, even now, whenit's better. I think they're still - maybe now the truck drivers might be more becuase there's a lot of them.·...

Right after my - before my Dad got sick. He was really kind of ·

sick there.

Well, my brother thought the family was taking advantage of me.

GA

I always thought they were. She babysat all -- all --

EA

It got to a point where they didn't even ask me. They'd just

drop them off. They'd just come and. Sometimes I was leaving

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s7:56

for someplace. And they 'd walk i n the front door . And they'd say,

d

here - here it is. Would youtake care of h im. I ' ll be back in

two hours. I mean, I was leaving. I was getting ready to go

somewhere or something. And - but I didn't mind it .

L

Soyou urged her to go to work.

GA

For that. And also for the fact thatI wanted her to get social

security. I always tought in case something happens, so she'll have something.

EA

I was happy at home. (laughs) It didn't bother me.

But, I had - I had the kids. And. In fact, I had my nephew here

continuously. Mybrother would bring, drp his. Like I said, I wouldn't mind if they told me they were bringing him. But it

got to a point wher they weren't telling me. They were just dropping them off.Ididn't babysit for anybody else. Except

for my own family. you know. My brother thought it would be a

-good idea So I said;O~, but I just want part time. I don't want

full time work.... I didn't want it. But for a long time, it

was completely full time. I enjoyed it. Oh, there's nothing--

work is work. I think I've learned alot. I'm pretty pleased

with myself. i started off in theproduction, you know. And

L

Production of eggs.

EA

Yes, with the candling. In the poduction side of the egg. And

then I took a night class in some typing. I had never taken

typing in high school. so I took a night class. Enough to l earn

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s7:57

typing. A little typing. And I can do the bookwork down there

now. I have no training for it. but I've learned. And I dothe

book work. I do theJedgers. I balance the bank books. I do

most of that. And I think that's a credit to me. Because it's

something I've never done really.

L

Sure .. a major accomplishment.

EA

I 1b.inkwhen I balance the bank book at the end of the year. It's

--- ~u know, :have two accounts to do. And I can balance to th

the penny, I think. Hey, i've done pretty good! I've learned to

type. And so in the long run, I've got a retirement now too

coming up. I broughtit home, see, I can retire. Because theyve

got a retirement plan down there, too. Also. And, I don't lack

for nothing. I don't n~ed nothing. The car I drive is his.

Butit's mostly mine. (laughs) I drive it all he time. He never

gets it. It's his but I call it my car becuase I drive it. But

I don't need anything. I don't feel like I need anyting.

The job, like I say, a job's a job. I've leraned to do things

that I didn't think I'd ever-without any basic training. I just

started a new thing where we do the egg count

and

that has to do with more figures and thingslike that which is

something for me. AndI've ~arned to do that. And I've learned

to do that now too in the last two weeks. Just tohave our office

manager to - when he's getting overloaded, so he gave me some

of his work.

I don't really know. When I was younger, I thought maybe I might.

Afraid of what?

Resonsibility? Youhad them.

To be responsible for somebody else. Anything like that. It never

really was that strong of a deal for me. I ·think whenr' was younger

maybe several times I thought about it. But there was never

really - I guess I never really met anyone I really wanted to

tie myself too. You know, I thought this is it. You know.

EAI

You'reboth such gentle nice people. think with me, the first years too. There were probably a couple
of occasions that couldhave happ~ned. But I think alot of responsi-

bilities too. Whethe~it was my own taking - and then, the

years justpissedyou by. .. And then you thought, it's not

worth it now. This point. Then if you didn't do it when you

were younger. I think that's alot that has to do with it. First

of all, you thought, maybe later maybe later. And then you finally

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s7:59

thought, hey, that later passed you by. But there's no regrets.

GA

Something must be catching on. I don'tknow. Like I said.

There must rave been ~mething in our family. I've got a brother

and a sister the same way.

EA

There's four of us that never married. I think you miss the kids

and yet you've had them. I know with myself. I've raised that one

boy I can honestly say (my newphew). And other nephews and nieces

are always around. Soyou don't miss that part. I have a .niece

that just got married and had a little one herself. And I get .

him atleast twice a week now, too. She tells me, when are you

going to quit

so you can babysit. And I said, little do

you know, that's why I went to work. We were laughing. I said

toher one day, when we were together Gavino's retired. Now he

can babysit for you. (laughs) So it isn't the children. Be-

cause there's children. There's always been childrne. There's

not alot of them in our family. there's very few .but they're

r

still there. The youngest, now, like I say, she has alittle

by now. My sister's kids are all grown · , up. They were a joy

too. My .nephews moved away. Maybe some day they'll have

children. I told them whenever they have them, that's when

I'll stay home. whenever they have any, 1'11 stay home and

take care of them Andso he moved away, so Ilost my chance there

Everyone was born here except for my broether (the one who's

in Cal~fornia) and myself. I don't know when. Probably about the

same way I didLet's see. It was after I come out of the service.

I came rut in - I came out--when? In '47. In 47. What was

I--I think I was 27 years old. Anyway. Because I didn't apply--

I applied for it when I was overseas. And I thought the

application had gone through. And I thought-- I never really~-

thought anything about it. And then one day, I began to wonder

I said. I wonder if it's gone through. So I went up to the

building, to inquire about it. And1hey asked me,

when di dyou apply. And I said, when I turned 21. I was

in the service. Infact, Iwasn't even 21. I think there was

a deal 1bere that you could apply, if you were in the service.

I was in New Guinea when I applied. So I wasn't even 21

then. so -(laughs) But I never got it til Ithink I was 27.

regimental clerk -- to fill out my papers. And those papers

probably didn't go anywhere. I just went up to the federal

were a citizen. He said, no. When didyou file. I toldhim. I

remember the judge. He asked me - when did you apply. I said

when Iwas in be srvicein New Guinea. And he said, oh, you were

in the service. And I said, yeah. He said, well, you come

tack and give me the date. It was about a week later, maybe no

more than 2-- he said, you come back tothis room so-and-so and

I never followed. And when I come out, I never--you know, I

alwyas considered myself a citizen. And nothing bothered me.

I had a job, I was working. There wasrn--except that I started

wondering if I am or not.

EA

It's a good thingyou did. Or you wouldhave gone ... allthese

years thought ... you were ..

GA

Like I said, that's all he done. It was someplace in - the

post office. The federalbuilding therein Salt Lake. That

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s8:64

one there. I don't even know what judge. He just give me a

date. And - to show up. It was soon after.

EA

I think Jimdid the same thing. Too. He just applied when he

was in the service.

GA

Well, hat's all you had to do. But then I said, I think the

only thing with mine, it was just a busy time. And thingslike

that I had an idea that probably that's about as far as it went.

The clerk. (laughs) Because I wasn't even back to division

headquarters or antying back -- where:iC)u ould go to some adjunctive general - somebody thatknows something. (laughs)

EA

And the rest of us were born here.

L

.... Have you gusy been approached or have had the opportunity

to become Mormons. have you been prostylitzed.

GA

I don't-

EA

A couple of missionaries have come to the door. Other than

that, you know. We get more Jehova Witnesses than you get

Mormons.

L

What's your reaction to Mormons prostalyty.zing you.

EA

They're good people. Idont' say they're not good people. Idon't

agree with their religion. I think they've got a real wierd

religion. I mean, they're - they're some of their beliefs are unbelievable as far as I'm concerned. One thing in particular,

I'll tell you an incident, we have - I've worked with LDS people.

Some are good and some are just mediocre LDS people. I happen to

work with two I think are very--and this one lady down at work

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s8:65

in particular, she said, made a statement, like . when I get to

heaven, I'm going to be skinny.

L

She's fat?

EA

Yes. She actually believes that their bodies areup there.

You know. But they believe this. i'm not saying. She's a good LD S
woman. She believes m her religion which is fine. I mean, I don't--

I don't like them pushing it on me.

L

Dd:hey.

EA

Not really becuase I tell them right away. I don't push mine.

I don't like them to push theirs.

GA

Onec£ the last riders I had - the ~e I ride to work with when I

was in the car pool. He's a Bingham kid. AndI worked maybe 30

years or more. We almost started theSc1me time. He's a Mormon

bishop.

right up the road.

But he's always

beeen a nice kid. But I've known hikmwhen he smoked. When he

drank coffee. Now, he . don't smoke and he don't drink coffee. but

b

he still drinks Coke.

EA

That's like this lady at work, she was telling me. She

didn't do this, she didn't do that. And Isaid, Mickey, I've

never done that.I didn't give it up. I've never done it

before.I never drank, I never smoked. And she was really patting

herself on the back becuase she didn't do it. And I jsut said

to her that I didn't thinkfuat was a big deal. I had never done

it. So big deal. But they don't do it. I don't see nothing.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s8:66

I believe if a person wants to drive, they can drink. anything

that's done in excess, more, - you know--ButI don't think

you should tell somebody else don't drink. If it's done

moderately, why not. Some people's religion don't like you to

dance. I don~t happen to bleive. There's nothing wrong with

dancing. But LDS people - they're good people but they're clannish.

GA

Especially in this -state.

That part surprised me. How they act here. And yet when they're

away from here-they--You know, I only served with one LDS

man when I was in the serivce that I could remember. And I
remember I went to - a ward muse when we were n New Zealand.

He asked me tog owith him. Not becuasehe wanted to convert me

He · just wanted company. And that's the only time I know that

I've been in there. That's what they remind me of. No matter where

they go, they look up their own. So they don't really- they're

Eat really mixing with anyone (laughs) else.

But I think up in Bingham, you proabbly had the morst Mromons

you've seen anywhere--

EA

They were

Mormons. Theyweren't realy the good staunch Mormons.

You know.·.

GA

r know what kind - the only kind that really bug me is themes

that go up with a book, and we;ve got them all. Most<£ them

real nice. Some<£ t;~m over do it. And some of them--

EA

They get fanatic, justlike any other religion.

GA

And some of them aren't Mormons at all. O mean,they might be

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s8:67

Mormons, but they're justin name. Someo of them, justlike

syas, I thinkthey're beliefs are all right.

EA

If that's that they want to believe--well, --

GA

It's all right. Idon't think much cf it. It's hard for me to

think - to believe even - that there was such a thing as · the

commandments. Andthat was a &ngtime ago. ButI can golike that,

scuase it's along time. But they'll never convince me that

somebody gave Joesph Smith a tablet in 1800 and something. And

whenthere were newspapers. You know. I just--

L

Thegolden plates.

GA

Thegolden whatever-- but that to me is hard tobelieve. It's

harder for me. Our religion, even yours, you know there's

history You know there were Jews in Pal_istine. You know,

Not a million--

L

Thousands.

GA

But you know there were places.

EA

They're there ..

GA

Thre's history. Theirs is just something that come up soon. Like

I say, if theyW:1.nt to believe it. I don't--

But there's people- I had another riderone time that really

shows the extreme of some people. We were going to work

one morning. And he made a remark ·about something that I'm an

LIDS first and American Second. For some reason or other.

And that kind of struck me as-- There is no place-you shouldn't

have to make a choice. -No otherreligionmakes a choice you have

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s8:68

to be ah you know something first and arnerican second. They

don't ask you to choose. But that to me--he reminded me of

the type, you:iead about it once in a while in the paper. The

one -- The Lafferty boys--themes that jumped out the window

in salt lake--there's alot ofthem. I think their religion brings out ...

L

Bringsout the fanatasism.

GA

I think it does. Becuase I don't think there's really nothing

there except you haveto believe it -and:pu can make up.

You know, it's

like that. The way they're so tolerant

ofpolygamy. In this state. I think - like I said, I think their

religion like that. But. Some of them-- in fact, most of

the people that I've worked with - they've been good people.

Now, those I don't think you could - really tell them that they

believe that or not. But I'veknown some--

be able to -they give their 10% faithfully. Theydon't drink.

They don't smoke. You know,they believe , it. Andthey're good

people. I think alot of them are like that. Mostof them I

dpn' t think believe _· that. At all. But you get a few that are

real fanatics about that.

L

The LDS first and the american second.

GA

You get some of them. ButI think they're like everything else--

I think they're a minority. Like I told some ofthe people

I work with - in fact, Llod, I'm more LDS than you are.

EA

That's what I try to tell them If that's what it takes to be an

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s8:69

LDS person, --

GA

I think mine for more political reasons.I think more LDS becuase

I'm more conservative. I'm real conservative in my politics.

And that's what they're always blaming the LDS - for being

too conservative. And yet the Mormons up at Kennecott - alot of them are good uni.onmembers they~re uote democrat. And I

tell thern,I'~~ore LDS than you are, you don't even vote--

EA

I object they're classifying New Mexicans as - what do they

call us -llaminites, whatever. I got into a discussionwi.th

one lady bcause ·a this. She was saying the Indians in Mexico

in the book .of of Mormon, they're llarninites, whatever they

are. AndI said, to her, do you honestly believe that your

Mexican people don'thave histories, that they don't have books.

That their history does-'t go back. Thatit took a person here

i New York to find at their history? I happen to know which tribe

I came from. What tribe of Indians in our area where my people

come forrn.TheBook Of Mormon doesn't habe b tell me that I'm

llaminite - or whateverit is. My motherwuld always tell us.

We came from originally, fromthie stribe- It was called

Achiku me tribe. And the Aztecs came in and they conquered A
~~~~-
tribe and they made _tha wbole ~egion. It was taken over by

the Aztec indian. So we know basicaly what our history is about.

WE don't haveto be told that this man in NEw york wrote about

our people some 100s of years ago. Becuase we have the history.

Just becuase you'rein another country - they have history.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s8:70

They have history books. tey have scholar~. And - I mean -

you can't tell these people becuase they feel, what do oy.ou know about it. Thosepeopledown there d.id't know nothing.

They had a civilizationdown there. They knew what they were doing.

GA I was telling my friend . . . . . I'm god. I'm one of the originals.

I'm a rnemberaf thelost tribe. You're just beginners. And if that;s

what they believe, why, i'm proably am.

. I'm

the original.

EA

Indians which we basically are - indians. We have ahistory. The

Indian wasnot a savage. Irnean, this is the way I feel. We have a basic, a good history. We have good - we ·'·re .Spanish. History.

And the town where my Morn says, it was settled when the Russian

fishermen came to us. They knew these tings. It wasn't like

L

It wasn't like Joseph Smith discovered you.

EA

No. Not like we were lost down there and somebody found us. In

the caves(laughs)

end side 8

begin side nine

GA

.. like I said, yes. I thnk that has alot to do with it ....

I've known several people, they've wondered whats a Chico

Romero. And - during

thestrikes, he joined the Mormon

church.But r .think it was becuase they\ere helping him. nobody

else was helpinglirn.

Food.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s9:71

EA

That's why Isay, alot of the Mexicans in Salt Lake joined the

church during the Depression years. You an't blame them.But

who knows what kind of problems they had.

L

Did you ever join the church.

EA

No. I;m very satisified with my own. And I believe in mine. I

happen to truely believe in mine. And Icbn't think theyoffer me

anything. Really. And I;m not looking for nothing.

GA

And like I say, I don't theink they have anything to offer. Like

I always thought about mine. You know. its kind of hard to believe.

EA

It takes a lot of faith.

GA

It does, you know. but at least I know my religion is old and that

it comes fromS)m~ place - it was there.

L

You mean you can verify.

GA

Yes, it's here. You know. The things that they mention,you know.

They come out here. I remember they had the big find in the

paper-in Turkey somewhere. Fine . ... But that history is

old back there.I don't really think they convince any people.

Like I say, they convince themselves. Theycan convince all the

people here becuse that's all--and they believe it. I think

they relly dobelieve ..

L - ---s-emee£- them real~y- ao- seem -to believe--

GA

I think they do. Like I say, I can't fault them - you know,

ofr believing. And. as - long as they believe that - I don't

believe that up until recenty they really thought that Mexicans

and Negros are second class. but they changed, like

OHI E&G Agu ayo 3-1 2-85 s9 :7 2

sports.

Wh en BYU was having trouble with blacks,

yotknow, sports. t he y changed real quick. Like the Negro

wasn't a second class- He could get t o heaven or whatever the

reason was. They had another revlation.

EA

The mark of Cain.

GA

They had a revelation. They can have revelationswhenever i t

- suits them. Absolutely.

EA

And I thinkfuey keep the women in their place. I think they

keep them in their place and I object to that. The Mormon

church. because they have no say. I object to that. And some

of those woemn are intelligent women. And I think they could--

often they justgo on with what they tell them.That just--I don't see it.

GA

But I can't really say that anybody likes it. I've worked with

Mormons all my life. Of course, up there - up there, we've always

had as many minorities, as many Catholics as we've had LDS.

But there's always - you know, they've always been there.

And like I said, most of them, theydon't bother you. But- if

you show an interest.

EA

Oh, they'll jump all overyou.

GA - -r.Tke rsay, th~croe r - rode with the ·1ast--Timothy. I've known him

all mylife. And neveronce has he ever you know comeait and

try convert. Maybe because we work, like I said, For a long

time, he was just anember - I mean, it's only within the last

f ive years that - they've made him a Bishop . He's not a bishop no

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s9:73

more. He's something else.

L

Stake Presdient.

GA

I don't think so. It think it's some kindc:f counselor. You

know ··.. But, he's the financial secretary of the union and

--but I've known him all mylife. Andhe's prokbably the highest

LDS that I've ever known. For sure I might have met some

others that were probably the same thing. Bishops-there's alot

of them.There's always bishops where you work.Sometimes I used to

think that they just calledhim that. ButIDw, I think maybe

they were ...·

But... I've never really had one talk --I've never believed them.

An I don't think they really have anything that's- .but they

think they're going to take over the world. They say, oh,

yeah, we've gained so much percentage this year and that year.

(laughs)

EA

A drop in the bucket.

GA

And I can think of that, you know. There's - there's - the

smallest religion in the states and the've probably got more

members in them. But here, they're strong. In this state.

They are strong. They are. I don't really mind them becuase most

of the time, politically, they think the way I do. So I've

put up with more - with more .of them for that reason. Probably.

And even there, I thinkthey're changing (laughs) But I

have met some awfully good Mormons.

EA

Me too.

GA

And theanes that aren't- I put them out of my mind.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s9:74

Cause like I said, thre's some. A-~

EA

Theres' some in our own religion.

GA

There's somet hat travel around with their little book. And

they spend all their days either finding their own members

and they're always talking about, you know--

L

The ones doing the geneologies.

GA

No, the Book of Mormon. Reading it. Or discussing it.

There's always two or three. Most of them stick to themselves. Those I just dismiss them. I go with them when I need something. Otherwise--

L

You let them go their own way.

GA

Yeah. Like I said, ... theanes I know, they're nice people. I

had one- he was in the class behind me. I liked him an ·awful

lot.. Bextrum. He just died a yer or year and ahalf agp, ,_;cancer.

And E was a good Mormon. I mean,there's one you could say-

was a good Mormon.I mean a good citizen. A good family man.

Never harmed anybody. Always nice and happy. Now, there's a

m

man you want to know. The fact that he was a Mormon was -

just something else.

A

I worked with one like that oo.

GA

ButI can imagine. He probably wouldbe everything that:is

-- he 's one of these that you always say, they wait until

thier bishop tells them which way to vote. And then they

vote.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s9:75

L

And then they vote.

GA

And then they vote. I think they probably did. He was about

ht kind that would do it.

L

That took thingsliterally.

GA

I think he did . . He was a good man. You know, somebody die

like that, quick like that. Like I said, a lot of people arelike

that. I think most of them are acutally just about as good

a Mormon as I am Catholic. - They were born there. So

they are there. They don't really - In fact, some of the

probably some of .the biggest - Max

the one we're talking

about is one.

EA

Is he a good mormon now.

GA

No.

EA

Actually at one time, they were Catholic.

GA

His ..father was a .cathlic at one time. Theyfound out when he

died. That at one time, he was Catholic.
GA That's why I said, most a the ones thatI've known.

some of them were good Mormons. Mostof them ..... .

EA

At one time, in school, they asked a question like that.

What makes a Mexican different - or something like that.

And they were asking theother kids. And one of the kids spoke

up and said. Well, they're better Catholics. And the teacher

got real mad. How dare anybody say somebody is better than

the Mormons. You know. And they just can't classify a Mexican

as a better Catholics. As a good Catholic. A religious persson. The teacher did not like that one bit.

OHI E&G Aguayo 3-12-85 s9:76

Well, that's not true, you know.I mean, well, that's not true,

you know. I don't know what rubbed her the wrong way. Kind of.

The s:udent that was doing.it., to him, he saw Mexican, he saw

Mexican.he saw Catholic. You know. Maybe not - in later years.

But at the time, that was so - Ah. He found very few people-

Mexican people that were not Catholic. Now you have them

Assembly of Goa. You have them LDS. And like I was going to

say, when they turn - Liker say, if A Mexican family turned

in the depression years. I don't think they truly believed

I think--you cannot. I can~t understand - theycan't. But I think

they're children do. Their children are raised in that religion.

And that-- I see that's the shameo it. The children are the

ones that you lose. You lose that. Becuase the ones that

made the change-they did it for-well, for whatver reason.

Notl::ecuase they believed. Because I don't think1heybelieved.

(alughs) But the children do. Becuse they were raised in bat

religion. And then beir children. And-their children. They

believe. They believe. And then you --you h.5ive lost that

family.

L

s you've created a new tradition of sorts, as it were.

I think it's the children tnatyou lose. -
