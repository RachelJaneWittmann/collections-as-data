 JC: SG: JC: SG: JC:
THIS IS STEVE GUTTMAN INTERVIEWING JOHN W. CORBIN FOR THE COLORADO PLATEAU URANIUM PROJECT ON JULY 29, 1970.
You want to know when I first came here? Yeah, when you first came to Moab.
Give my name, too?
Right.
My name's John W. Corbin. I was born in Moab in November, 1896. My family lived here until I was about nine years old, at which time we moved to---?---, Colorado because the schools were better than they were in Moab. My Father continued in business in Moab, having started the first newspaper here in 1896. He was Moab's first county attorney and he practiced law here. In fact, he was about the only lawyer they had here. Of course, in his day, they didn't know what uranium was, but he was very much interested in gold and silver mining in the La Sal Mountains. And he organ- ized the Mountain Mask Mining Company(?), incorporated out of Denver, Colorado, made up of a bunch of railroad men. Spent a
lot of money there, but never got anything, like many others. About 1903, they only had one telephone line in this area. It was a single wire line between Moab and Thompson, Utah connecting
with Western Union, so he decided that we needed some more lines, telephone lines at points around here. So he started a pack out- fit, or at least a kind of---?--- Incidentally, he started this

 JOHN W. CORE.IN 1/1 PAGE 2
newspaper, and being the kind of---?--- called it the Grand Valley·Times, which is still in existence, only known as the Times-Independent. These two papers· merged later on. Well, he got into this mining and had a crew of men working at La Sal Mountain. And the family at one time for a period of about two years lived in a town known as Castles, Utah just at the foot
of La Sal. It's not in there now. Nothing but a few rats. But at that time when we lived there, oh, I imagine around 1906, '05 or '06, in there, why, they had about two hundred people in there. Had two saloons and a grocery store, and it was quite a thriving community. All of them were trying to get rich out of La Sal
Mountains.
SG: Did any of them make it?
JC: There was a few made it pretty good. There was a fellow by the
name of Fred McCoy that discovered and mined some pretty good copper ore in the area, and he had several good offers to sell those mines., but he never did sell them. He wanted more money; he wanted lease money and so forth. He got a little cash from these people that were interested, but there never was any deals ever closed as far as copper mines went. And, of course, there
was Gordon Fowler. He's. been there for many years. He just died here last year. He did a lot of mining in there, a lot of

SG: JC:
prospect work--had done. Had quite a lot of money furnished to him b.y outsiders. to mine in the area. And I think they do have some stuff now· that--there's been some outfits exploring it lately, I know of to get some ideas of if it's worth working.
Is this Fred McCoy also deceased?
Fred McCoy passed away a pauper. He lived in what's known as-- have you even been to Chasm?
I've been through it.
Little cabin up there, little one room cabin. Did you notice it
on the left side of town as you come in? Well, that was originally built around 1900 by Billy Marter. Fred McCoy occupied to be a
millionaire anytime.
SG: He never gave up hope?
JC: Never gave up hope. After we moved to Colorado, why, my Father
been here for a few years and went over there into business for a while, the contracting business. But he--he didn't do any good, so he had sold out what work he had done with telephone
work here, putting in a line to Monticello, Utah and went into Chasm. Sold out to a group of fellows that thought they was going to get rich in the telephone business. But after he was gone, he sold the news.paper too. He operated it for about ten
years, but he sold it probab.ly sometime after that. After he

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1
PAGE 4
was gone a few years, I think about nine years, he started building the telephone line out of Mack, Colorado to Price, Utah. There
was no connection across there, and we spent a little time there working on the telephone line across there. However, we never completed it, only to Green River, Utah. Still had to go clear around through Denver to get to Price or Salt Lake. But along
about 1925, the Bell,---?--- by the Bell Telephone Company, bought our interests on the desert, and then built lines across there connecting Price and Grand Junction about 1925.!_ =::-?--- develo__pe_L this country down here after my father came, and I went instead.
And he sold out after he started building that line. Well, after he got that line completed, why, he came back down here, and these fellows, these cowpunchers that bought line said, "Come and get it. We don't want any more of it." So he came back and took it back over. And he came to develop·it until the time of his death, in 1923. After ab.out 1~15, I worked with him all the time. And when he passed away, I took over the operation. But we didn't have too much of an operation. It was. just a small town, you know. Moab only had--well, up to the time of the uranium boom, we only had about a thousand or twelve hundred people. We did build exchanges in Monticello, Bland-ing-,-U-tah...-G o- ou.Land_Jm.ild__an_exchange in
quite a few towns.. And we built one at Dove Creek, Colorado, which

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 5
the company still owns. This was an all manual operation up
until about 1948 when we converted to our first---?--- in Moab. Just the old---?--- type. And in 1948, we got over 250 telephones going. We thought we had something. Hmph. And we put in a
hundred lines and a hundred---?---, and well, we thought that
would be something that would be here from then on. The way the t,own was going, why, that would take care of it. In 1955, we
had completely out grown it, and we made the first--the relay
dial job was put in. And since then it's been one continuous growth. In 1948 to '55, you see, we get into that uranium boom. Ab.out 1952, it started coming in a little, and by 1953 it was
really starting to hit. I was elected mayor in the fall of 1953, and it didn't look like there was going to be anything very exciting around here.· I took it on. I thought somebody ought to take a crack at it. I had been on the council. By the time I took office,
or soon after in January and by early spring, this town was just wild. Boy, we had more uranium companies in here--stock, green stock tellers, you know, with chips so that the certificates didn't mean anything. There was prob.ably only one out of ten that was any good at all, and they were all operating under corporate laws, you know, that limited them to under $300,000 that they didn't have to
report to the government on and all. If they was under $300,000,

 JOHN W. CORBIN # 1 P AGE 6
they didn't have to go through. the security exhange. And, boy, they was going to town on that business around here~ A lot of these fellows would go out and pay, oh, quite a few of those claims in a day. Just old claims will do, a cow pasture. Then they come in here and sell these certificates to these men, their locations and everything. The prospective customers for twenty dollars apiece, and they were buying them with cash, selling them for cash outright, and those people was starting the companies
with that stuff.
SG: Did you buy any of these so-called penny-stocks yourself?
JC: No, very little. I had very little of it. I did get one little
bunch, but they were never really any good. They finally merged to some oil outfit that was just here a year ago. So we sold 'it for about two to one, a little more, so we did all right. We ---?---awful---?--- didn't have to worry about it. But that's abDut all I ever bought.
SG: Did quite a few of the local res:idents. get burned by these penny- s.tocks?
JC: No, I don't think so. There was quite a lot of local people made some money out of the uranium boom, locating claims, and then some of them had s.ome real claims. They wasn't just ---?---. Of course, those boys that were locating these claims and selling

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 7
them for five dollars a piece were making quite a bit of money. They would sell maybe a hundred dollars a day. You know, they were doing all right. But there was a lot of fellows that made
money on finds that actually would produce, but none of them ever kept much of it. They weren't used to ever having much spending money and, boy, it went through their hands right now.
SG: They'd spend it as fast as they got it?
JC: Yeah. But some of them, you know, had quite a little fun with it
for a while. But when it was all done, it was kind of bad, but
it was just the same type scene. You went through all that money. There was no need of them throwing all that money away.
SG: No.
JC: ---?--- Mills. I guess you've heard of---?--- Mills. Only last
w.inter he used to do a lot of work for Charley Steen as an attorney and so forth. Then he pleaded with Charley, he and two or three others. I think at one time he had about four million in cash that he got out of something. Take about half that and put it where you can't bother it, or touch it. "Oh no," he said. "Put it in, spend it, make more." Those fellows don't make no money.
McCormick, all of them made a little money. They banked---?--- is an attorney, McCormick grubstaked a few. And a lot of these fellows came out with quite a little money. And he had a lot of it for a
---?---
.'

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1
PAGE 8
while, but he s.pent it.
SG: Did you grubstake any of the miners at all?
JC: No, never got into any of that. All the money we ever made was
selling out the telephone company. After we got it up pretty good, why, a holding company come along and offered us a pretty good stock deal. Still operate the same thing that we had in- corporated. In fact, we sold it to one holding company which w.as later merged with the Continental Telephone Holding Company,
which I guess you read about. That fellow that was killed by accident back there---?--- He was the fellow--! knew him per- sonally--he was the one that started that Continental Holding Company just about ten years ago, I'd say. In fact, I was looking through my files here yesterday. I knew I had this letter. And
I had a two-page letter that he had written me after they acquited the Redlands Power Agency and he just--six years and one month to the date that he wrote that letter he was killed.
They still don't know who did it?
SG:
JC:
SG: They still don't know who put the bomb there?
JC: No. They think--they feel somewhat that it was a mistake. That
Huh?
there was two cars there, these two Cadillacs that looked just alike, or were ahout the same models, and they figure that they

 JOHN W. CORBIN # 1 P AGE 9
put·it in the wrong one.
SG: The car belonged--who owned the other car?
JC: Well, they never did hear. But there were two of them. This was
a '66 Cadillac. I never saw much in the paper about this, but we heard it through the company that there was another '66 parked right
there, and maybe that's the one they intended. You know, they evidently--whoever had it done, they didn't do it themselves, they hired someone. No question about that. I don't know. It was sure a terrible thing, but lots of terrible things happen.
SG: A lot of people have remarked that there was some--they were sur- prised that there wasn't more violence conducted in Moab while the uranium boom was going on.
JC: Well, you know, there really wasn't that much. This violence has all cropped up in the last few years, this trouble. Back in those days, we had a lot of pretty rough people in here, but we never had any serious trouble. Hell, when I went in, we only had one policemen. He was chief of everything. Well, finally we got--
Pete quit and went to job or sheriff, sheriff's deputy, you know, and we hired a fellow out of Salt Lake to come in nights as chief of police, but he had one man. That was all and kept the town in pretty good shape. There were times when we must have had too many
---?---
They were just all over here. And there was no place to

 JOHN W. CORB.IN Ill
PAGE 10
live, and they had their trailers parked on the sides of the streets and so forth. And we'd go tell them, "You can't stay here." They say, "Well, where are we going to go?" Well, it's just one of those things. And then they'd finally go up and find a few little places in their orchards for trailers. Pretty poor storage connection, and God, they'd tie them in--tie them into this little old sewer mains we had around here, you know. And
we had--I can remember about six months after I went in as mayor,
we had raw sewage running down First West.
SG: Was sewage the main problem that the city had then?
JC: It was one of them that they had. We had a pretty good water
supply. Of course, they had developed a lot more water---?---
We had a few wells those few years when I was in there. And we acquired a ranch up here that had quite a lot of water on it, and
we piped that into the system. But those first years that they
were in here, the main trouble was the sewers and a place for people to live here. Now, did you read that book that come out about these two old fellows that had been here? I told you it had my name
in there.
SG: Is that the book called Uranium Fever?
JC: Samuel--no, it was Samuel Taylor. He---?--- Sally in there a few
months ago.

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 11
SG: JC:
Yeah, I've seen that.
I haven't read it all the way through. I read up to where they had this chapter on the boom town and stuff, but a lot of that wasn't authentic. They overexaggerated. They said we had tar paper shacks all over the main streets and everything. Well,
we didn't because we stopped it, or we would have had. But we had a few things get in here that we didn't get stopped before they got in like they have a garage right up here next
---t()fhe schoo-1.--1-t 's still there. But we hadwi.t h·i n· ninety days after I was mayor, we brought in a man, a planner from Provo,
Dale Despain. He came in here and worked with us for several
years. We put in, right off the bat, we put in a stopgap ordinance to do away with that kind of an operation, though. So ~hey couldn't-- we had all these main business districts stopped. They couldn't
do anything on them without permission. It had to be zoned and have it approved before they built it. We had to, otherwise you'd have a tar paper shack everywhere, these people wanted hamburger stands all up and down.
SG: What was the name of the planner again?
JC: Uh, Dale Despain. I think he worked out of Provo. SG: D-E-S-P-A-I-N?

  JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 12
JC: I've got some of his construction right here. Dale Despain. I'm pretty sure he's still--he may have left Provo, but he's b.een down here working with them some within the last--this is quite a deal he's put out here what is ahead for Moab.
SG: I wonder if we could temporarily b.orrow this to duplicate it? JC: Yeah, you can do that if you want to. See, I got another here. SG: Yeah, anything like that we would like to temporarily borrow to
duplicate them, and then send them back to you. You want all this
ot er mater1al~ from 1nsicl~ tne ape.
JC: This is Moab. Let's see, who wrote that? Let's see. Operation--
committee of the spring and sunnner of 1956, as a pub.lie service of the Grand County Chamber of Conunerce. And this is Moab right here. This is written up right here. Of course, now I would definitely
have to make a list of these and have your name on them because
I definitely want them back because they're fragile material. SG: Right.
JC: My wife had them hid and she dug them out for me today.
SG: Yeah, definitely. We'll send them back to you along with the
trans.cription of the tape itself, which you also can keep.
JC: Outside of thes.e two here, one of them is the Chamber of Commerce
and the other one of them is the Moah Water Development.

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 13
SG: How did the city meet its sewage prohlems? You mentioned that that was one of the primary--?
JC: Oh, it's all been taken care of now. Yes, they have put a lot of money on here to---?---. That first year, you know, it was just a small population, just a--it's a lot tax take. We couldn't find money anywhere. We had to borrow on a tax anti- cipation deal. So we managed to borrow from a fellow who was operating as--well, you used to call it kind of a shyster broker firm out of Salt Lake. Oh, that was back in '56, along in there. He may still be. I can't think of his name. But that first sixty thousand saved us. Gee whiz, though, we've had a lot here--they've had a lot of government help, too, you know.
SG: Did the federal government put in any money?
JC: Oh yeah. They put in money to help the water system. Of course,
we bought this big ranch that I told you about. We bought while I was on there. We bought that ranch including the cattle and everything for $200,0QO from the Summervilles and we took what
water we wanted off it; that is, we took some of the land where the golf course is, and we took--oh, we took the--where all the springs were at and made deals, and then turned around and sold

 JOHN W. CORB.IN /11
PAGE 14
SG: JC:
the cattle and the ranch for practically enough to pay the whole hill.
That wasn't a b~d deal!
Yeah.• We.salvaged mos·t of the water ---?--- then. This- man that's got it now, he drilled wells, he's got lots of water too. But we took all the good springs that were available. We sold out to him at--well, it wasn't a big price. I think they only charged him for a lot of land up there. I think they only charged him about sixty-five dollars an acre for it. But all and all, cattle arid everything, the Moab city water supply didn't cost a whole lot. And after he b.ought that, he turned around and subdivided a lot
of it. Of course, he's got a lot of ranch, but he took to sub- dividing that stuff, and charged people, oh, seven hundred dollars for h6mesights. And boy, I think he got most of his money back too.
So everyone's prospered off this deal?
SG:
JC: Everybody's prospered off it.
SG: The original owners--was their name Summerhalls? Was that it? JC: Was is what? No, that was where they lived. Right up in the
middle of the valley here. It was. the old B.reen ranch, the old Breen ranch~ but it was owned by Summerville, Lloyd Summerville ---·?--- And he·made a pretty, you know, a couple of hundred thousand dollars. In thos.e days that was a lot of money. He

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 15
made pretty doggone--he was pretty well satisfied. Then they got what they wanted, and the man that bought it got all his
money back, and he's still got the ranch, or a good portion of it.
SG: And some people have got nice homes.
JC: In fact, my son-in-law bought a piece of land up there at seven
hundred dollars an acre. I said, see, I says, that's terrible. We sold that land at sixty-five dollars an acre. And a company wanted it for a home sight. They bought about fourteen acres. And a lot of people bought that stuff up there. And they was tickled to death with it. But, you know, right in that area, there's a lot of water, a lot of underground water. And, of course, back in the days when I was mayor, we didn't know much about that ground. Knew of these few springs underground, but
we didn't know about all that underground water. And since then and they felt, well,---?--- they've got---?--- In fact, it's still---?--- few permits that are still getting a bill, I'll tell you. ---?--- I can still---?--- up there the other day ---?--- these ranches.. Ahout a mile up there, I got ranches
up there. I---?-..-- the other day that---?--- looked the thing ---?--- looks the---?---. So there's a lot of underground
water. There's a lot of underground water right in across the

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 16
valley, so we can get water most anywhere. It's deep, but not any good, so ---.?--..-·why, you know, it's got minerals ---?---. But you get above the---?--- here, it's good water, very good water. Most all this water sinks out of the La Sal Mountains. ---?--- by Craig, but there's. a lot of water going down ---?---
SG: So water is not one of Moab's problems at all?
JC: No, I think unless the town has a heat stroke, I don't think
they have anything to worry about for a while. I don't think it's going to get much b.igger unless some other boom hits, but you never know. In fact, it's dropped back a little. Mining has gone hack some, and there hasn't been any big---?--- to be
opened up. Oh, there's one up here about thirty-five miles ---?---, hut they---?--- A few of those. But they're not going to put in a mill---?--- about 150. No, I don't think there's b.een any--any ---?--- that up here. Of course, we've had oil since we got that uranium, you know.
SG: You got the potash.
JC: Yeah, we had the potash. Now that wasn't too successful, but
they're figuring out--they're doing away with that mining and filling it with water. I guess they told you all about that. In fact, they figure that's going to be a good deal because they can get that stuff out so much cheaper. And the·way it's

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 17
been, mining costs have been too great---?--- market.---?--- SG: Well, do you think the area then will become more and more of
a tourist area?
JC: I think so. Yeah. And it looks a lot like the possib.ility like
there might someday be quite a lot of places for retired people. There are some people here right now coming in here. Of course, we---?--- we go down to Arizona to---?--- But I stay here most of the time. I got a place in Arizona, an expensive---?--- down there. But there's no reason in the world why they couldn't build some of these things like Sun City right here in Moab.
SG: It doesn't get that cold here, and not that much rain. So--
JC: No, it gets plenty hot in the summertime, too, and that's what
they seem to like. The winters are fairly mild most of the time.
Oh, about sixty days is about all we have.
SG: Well, to go back to the b-0om period again, you mentioned another
problem was housing. What kind of things did the city do to
try to--?
JC: Well, they didn't do too much of anything. There was trailers,
a lot of trailers. And a lot of people started trailers courts, but a lot of the trailer courts is gone now. They just finally automatically clos·ed out, hut there was a lot of them. Pretty near every orchard had trailer courts. Of course, we had to
do a lot of zoning on that too. Most of those have---?---

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 18
themselves. They just diminished out. There are just a few here and there. There's a big one down on the other side of the hos- pital. It seems to be both sides of the trailer court---?---. That was a big deal. They b.uilt then, gee, I guess there was a million dollars spent for that, plus the land and everything,
you know. ----?--- ---?--- And it was sold out---?--- and the .::.---?--- People--oh~ I don't know, I think when the government loan project---?---, I think they were finally told anyway by whoever was financing it, that they'd never get the money back. And I don't think they got 10 percent. The people that bought it now, you know, they---?---
SG: Your population seems fairly stable now, so--
JC: Seems to be. I think it was a little higher than this, though,
at that time. And we had 150 mine companies in here at the time. There wasn't very many of them in the mines, most of them was
messing around in the street picking up stock and selling stock.
And a few of them had a lot---?---. Oh, I tell you. About the ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~->as~.p.-.ring of '53, I think--! don't know, I think Steen got himself
a little area in there. The first I knew about Steen in anything was--oh, you heard rumors that he was supposed to have something up there, liut people didn't think anything about it. He came into

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 19
the telephone office one day and used the pay phone. And I had my office right in the front room. ---?--- that used to be the front part of the telephone company.
SG: That's what he said.
JC: And I heard this guy talking on the phone, something about the
press, a press report. And he says, "I got news for you." And
I suppose---?---. I think he did have something. I don't know. I just though then, "Hell," I thought. "Hell, that's his ---?--- about this stuff and there's nothing to it." But in a few days
I saw trucks rolling through. Rolling down.
SG: It was real?
JC: From then on it was really--it would be nice if you buy another
one like that. But I just don't think those things strike twice. SG: What kind of problems did the telephone company have?
JC: Oh, we had terrible problems. We only had five telephone circuits
then out of here, and we didn't have very much capacity for tele-
phones in town. We finally wound up with four party business ---------·~-1:i-a-t~~~ul.c:L.pu.t-our._, and 11p ta te~weJ.y_e__
party, generally ten party, oh, for the residential. And it was rough. We didn't get much relief. In fact, everything--most everything went hy Western Union, and we still have Western Union.

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 20
And most---?--- in those days, we were pulling our emergency ----?--- We didn't have a printer. We were phoning ours in
to Grand Junction. And most everything went by way of Winston. You know, they couldn't through Lincoln. They could drive over to Grand Junction quicker than they could get a call through.
SG: What was the average time for a phone call?
JC: Oh, for a short haul we'd wait. Oh, I imagine we'd complete a
couple hundred calls a day, but you know, it was a long struggle and a long wait. B.ut now they tell me that they can complete several thousand a day. You know, they've really got an adequate amount of service around here. I can't keep up with them. Mostly all, they got these wire circuits, yes, but they don't use them. They're supposed to have everyting on microwave. Got these wire circuits along the road out here. I think most of them are used locally around some of these things---?---. But that used to
be our complete outlet. We had those large circuits, and then we had carriers on them. But we finally got our first eight circuits ab.out one year after the thing got to the top here. One year later. And that give us quite a bit of relief. And then we started it from there, we got it coming in pretty fast. So we carry it for a year having the whole situation---?---
It was three or four years---?--- you know. And we haven't

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 21
got as much---?---. They can't get the---?------?--- here just for that. If they can't--they don't get all the lines they want, but they got most everything in business now and some private residences. But a lot of four-party lines in the city limits, and out in the ranch area there's a lot of ten-party.
SG: While this boom was going on or before, did the Bell System ever become interested in taking over?
JC: Oh no, no. No, they never did. They don't want the companies that are having a hard road. They just want the big ones. Profit. They don't want the---?--- No, they never did try to
buy us. They tried to help. They did help us far away. One time they helped with second hand equipment they might have on
hand that they weren't using or with money. They let us have money occasionally. But they never cared for the Pioneer ---?--- Of course, after these holding companies came in and, you know, there are three or four around the country buying
the company---?--- fabulous price-wise. Then the Bell could start to compete with the holding companies 'cause a lot of it's
Much m ore---?---
SG: How about the General System?
JC: ---?--- General Bell---?--- They bought properties too. But
most of the General Telephone Company is---?--- up to La Sal.

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 22
They don't waste too much in getting into voltage---?---. But there was about four holding companies that buy these companies. They still operate under the same name. They still operate under the same franchise, and your money that you finance that you had---?--- Like, we had bond issues and stuff like that.
I mean, they'.re still in existence. They still carry them. Those things were down there at 4 percent, 4.25 percent. You can't borrow money like that now. Those are twenty-five year
deals---?--- returns • . Still operated the corporation under the corporate name. I works out. It works out here for the people that built it up from scratch. You know, we worked for a lot of years without very much money. We had lots of fun,
but not much money.
SG: Did most of your financing for the expansion--was this done by
bonds?
JC: We did--yeah, we did pretty much finally get into bonds. Pretty
much in---?---. We had to, though. We had two or three groups of bonds. We did some of the financing through finance companies like---?--- Corporation---?--- equipment company. You know
we had to finance that. But most of the big money come from
bonds. Of course, now it's become---?--- to do their own financing. I don't know. They do it through a lot of different channels.

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 23
They built a tremendous---?--- in the last ten years. Over
a million---?--- where they were operating it---?---. Let's see now, that fellow back there that was killed the other day must have had a little on the ball. Of course, they get that thing through, why, it don't make no difference.
SG: In terms of your cost of operating this business, how was this affected by the boom?
JC: Say what?
SG: The cost of operating the system itself?
JC: Well, naturally it goes up because we had to hire more help,
but we had more money to work with. But we lost a lot of
money too. We had so many shysters in there that wouldn't pay.
They'd charge up a bill, you know, and you couldn't keep track of them. Lot of---?--- Well, naturally, you start doing a pretty big business, well then---?--- the Western Union Tele- graph or otherwise, you had the money coming in. And everybody had money to pay their bills with. That was one good thing.
You didn't have to worry about the---?--- right there in the early thirties when they had to go out and ask somebody to drive ---?--- to pay the phone bill so we could pay an operator. But, oh, they had plenty to eat around here back in those days, those
depression years when there was not very much money. I can remember---?--- them asking for money to pay---?--- And we

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 24
used to pay---?--- too.
SG: You didn't have this kind of problem, though, during the boom? JC: Oh, no. The only problem we had was trying to catch all the
shysters that would cheat us out of the phone bill. But---?--- ---?--- But we were doing pretty good. Even though we didn't have much business, we were doing well.
SG: About what size was the company at this time?
JC: Uh, you mean how many customers?
SG: Yeah. Well, sales volume, things like that. Do you have any
idea? Do you remember?
JC: Well, no, I don't. We'd have to refer to some of the statements.
You mean at the time the boom hit?
SG: Yeah. Well, you know, if you got an idea of what it was right
before the boom and then about halfway through?
JC: Well, I don't think we had a capital investment of much over a hundred thousand dollars at the time of the boom. And now the corporation runs an investment of, oh, at least three million.
SG: So it's pretty good sized increase?
JC: Y ep.
SG: The telephone company, was it able to receive any kind of a
subsidy or any kind of help from the state or federal government? JC: No. ---?--- we just keep trying to serve the public as we have.

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 25
SG: JC: SG:
JC:
We got a lot of customers. I've been mayor and also running the telephone company and couldn't get a call through and they
were mad at the city. They couldn't get that---?--- and that's why they're out on the street, but I survived.
So did the city.
Yeah, the city survived.
Did the road conditions cause any problems for the telephone company laying down the lines?
No, we hadn't--we didn't have too much of those problems. We had fairly good--I guess, pretty near as good as highways as
we got now. Out here---?--- anyway. And, of course, did all we could to get some highways, but we had---?---. No, our bad road conditions date back further than that boom, way back. About--oh, about 1925, then we had some real road problems. It used to take generally about six hours to drive to Monticello. How about the city itself? Were there any new roads or anything like that?
Oh, they had some of these roads for oil; yeah. Now that's another thing---?--- that I didn't go along with. Except---?---, Sam going everywhere and no oil. I think about half of these streets, they were oiling all along all the time. They would get a little
SG:
JC:
money from the government every year, you know, and from the state

  JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 26
sometimes out of the tax bill, and they were oiling them a lot. And I think a good part of them were in the city, right within the city limits---?--- oil. And we didn't---?--- channels like that---?--- did.
SG: So the city was able to keep up with roads, the problems with roads and everything?
JC: Oh yeah. They weren't the best of roads, but we didn't have any real problems. No, the roads weren't any big problem. The water, sewer, and power for people was the--of course, we didn't do much about housing. Just built these trailer courts and things like that to help---?--- more. ---?--- when they talked me into taking that, they wanted me to take it a couple of years before that. It used to be a two-year term; then it was four. And I
said, "No, I don't want it." So then they talked me into this
thing when they saw the boom hit.
SG: You should have taken it the first time!
JC: I thihk that was much more--I enjoyed it much better to be in
that boom than to have just a dull time, you know. Sit there when you win. I can remember here before that boom, I can tell you where our first dial job came in here in 1948 out in the places in---?--- Why, gee, there wasn't any--we just put in two tele- phone a month, and we had no problem. We had 100 lines sitting

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 27
up there and 250 phones, and we though we was sitting on Easy Street. From then on, in '55, we was so far down in the hole then, and we put in a brand new one. And that's still not enough. They're getting ready to throw out---?--- and coming clear back this way---?--- tearing out the Moab---?--- in there. Tear down---they're going to tear that all out, most of it. I'm glad I'm not running this place anymore. I'll tell you, I wouldn't
want to have all that.
SG: How long was it before the telephone company decided the boom
was real? That it wasn't another of these phony booms that you've
had in years past?
JC: Oh, I don't know. We never did worry about it much one way or
another. We had a lot of booms here through the years that didn't last very long, but this was, oh, it looked pretty real because like we had a boom here in 1925 that lasted about two weeks. They were drilling for oil, and they struck some oil down the river. The oil lasted a little longer than that. We
had the first boom when---?--- about 1920. They saw---?--- either way over here--as far as town. And people got excited
at that, and we had a pile of people in here just for a week. Then there was one that come in down the river in 1925. That thing blew oil, and, boy, I don't know, it was weeks before they

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 28
ever got it stopped, but they never did find that. I guess the oil come out b.ecause after---?--- any oil they have they got
it stopped. But that thing made a mess, and they got---?--- five thousand dollars a day. And I don't know, they didn't have much to stop it in those days. And I guess it was weeks before they ever got to enough---?---.
SG: But no other wells came in after that?
JC: Oh yeah, there's been lots of oil around. I mean, this Lisbon
Valley area, they've got quite a lot of oil up in there. They're pumping---?--- all that stuff's on pipeline going out of here ---?--- ---?--- the beginning of the uranium boom.
SG: Well, that's what I meant. There weren't any wells back in '25? JC: No, no. Just that thing down the river. There was a---?---
going on and a lot of money spent here and there. People drilling. They drilled two or· three wells down the river about '25, '26.
And there's been quite a bit of drilling around---?------?---
up in Lisbon, and they struck that up there. Now that country's still producing pretty good, and there was a little lull about
19.57 when the uranium business come in and give it stimulation. SG: Did some people criticize the telephone company for expanding
too slowly? JC: Oh, what?

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 29
SG: You should have kept up with it a little better than you did? JC: Oh, yeah. You'd get out on the street and hear people say,
"I don't know why those people don't at least run a bare wire out from here. You know how simple and easy that would be, so we could get out here once in a while.'' We had lots of wire out here---?--- put carrier equipment on top of the wire was out here---?--- wire out here---?--- circuits on that wire.
JC: It was being able to get the equipment from the manufacturers. And it was a joint venture between us and the Bell people. They was having just as much trouble as we were. We got that thing ready to go just one year before. We cut that into service in July, about one year after their equipment was ordered.
SG: In your view, did the telephone expand as fast as they could to meet this demand?
JC: We never had any real financial problems when---?--- was here. Like today, we had this Stromberg Loan outfit that was loaning us a lot of money. We get---?--- a hundred thousand we could get it from---?--- It didn't make any difference. Then we had this bond issue that we put in--oh, I don't know, it was
a little later. We picked up a lot of those loans on Stromberg, and I think on this bond issue we was getting 4.75 percent money.
We got that out of an insurance company in Texas. Can't get

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 30
that kind of money now at 4.75 percent. SG: No.
JC: Those---?--- are still tighLat home down there. It was a twenty-five year loan and,,.---?--- the majority of it ---?--- they can't--can't beat it. Right now it's 8, 9 percent.
SG: If not higher.
JC: Yeah. Yeah, we got--well, I think we got enough to clean up
everything we owed when we got that thing. We got about $750,000
from that---?---.
SG: Well, to move back now to the city itself and about the problems
they had, was there any problem with health? You mentioned the
sewage being so bad. Did this cause any health problems? JC: No, I don't think anybody was ever very sick. Never heard
that way. No, they built this new hospital down here during those hurried days, but they needed a hospital. They just had a little three or four room deal over here at Moab, arid they
built that---?--- No, they didn't have any serious problem. We weren't too long---?--- Like I say, we got that first fifty thousand. We paid through the nose, but we got it. But then after that, why, things started looking up. ---?--- bank structure---?--- were entitled to bond money and we never had any ---.?--- lot of government money. But we never had any

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 31
---?--- a lot that first year.
SG: Did progress cause the city any additional problems because the
fact that so many of the miners were living here, but mining
outside of the county itself in, say, San Juan County?
JC: Well, they got a lot more of the money in San Juan County than Moab,---?--- San Juan County. They were right in there where
all the ore was. Just all the money up there, all the tax base. They wasn't getting too much tax here---?--- problem---?--- San Juan County to spend that money---?---. They don't have
it now. ---?--- but they don't have the money they had then. Gee, they were building school buildings and every little thing happened to think of, they'd just go build it. ---?--- along after the third or fourth year of the boom. But everything,
you know, in fact, all the oil they---?--- is mined in San
Juan County.
SG: Yes. I was wondering if this caused an additional burden on
the city, given that so many people were living in Moab.
JC: Well, it was a burden, but then we had to take care of them.
We never got any help from San Juan County. They got the money,
and we got the headaches.
SG: Do you remember what a typical day was for you back in this time?

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 32
JC: SG:
JC:
A typical day?
Yeah. What kinds of things would normally come up in a day?
I mean, how you would--?
I think there might be so many things I might be out looking
at. I even had to go out on one case. I had a complaint :from people, from a woman that lived up in the area called---?--- where they had kind of a rooming house. And they had a rooster that crowed at four o'clock every morning. And I went up and tried to get her to get rid of that rooster. Well, I says, "I'll buy it if you let me have it. I can't listen to any more complaints." So she sold it for about three dollars.
SG: Did you have to pay for it yourself, or did the city pay for it? JC: No, I paid for it. Yeah, I got twenty-five dollars for my
salary. SG: Money!
JC: They raised it to seventy-five along about in my second term there. But we hired right shortly after the---?--- shortly after---?--- man. He didn't have full authority or anything,
but he was pretty handy. He---?--- You had to have someone to---?---. I couldn't cope with it all. I had to take all the---?---. ---?--- I had to take a cut. Oh, he took some too. Most of them, though, didn't like him anyway. But he

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 33
SG: JC: SG: JC: SG: JC:
SG:
JC:
SG:
was a very good efficient man too, but they didn't like him. He's still in that husiness ---?--- out in Arizona---?--- now. He's been three of four places since he left here. But mainly he's been offered better jobs from these places.
You remember what his name was? Ellis--Ellis Foote(?).
Well, how do you spell the name? F-0-0-T? Uh, F-0-0-T-E.
And he's in Arizona now?
Yeah, one of those towns in Arizona. I can't remember them so well. He was in California for quite a while
Were there any other people the city had to add on their payroll because of the new jobs created like that?
No. Like I say the police about all. Before this thing hit, they had--
Did they have to have a sanitation engineer in here, or did you already have one?
JC:
SG: Did you have to add something like a sanitation engineer or a
water--?
JC: Oh, yeah. We had several engineers in here doing work for us.
Some of them were professional. In fact, some of them come
What?

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 34
out here from Salt Lake City to do some extra surveys for extra service and they got down here out to the west end here, arid they got down here out to the west end here, and they had the pipe on top of the ground. They weren't the best---?--- too many---?--- engineers.
SG: I guess the problems came so fast that you really didn't have much of a choice of who you were hiring for the jobs like that? JC: Oh, it didn't do much good. In fact, the help situation itself
was much better than it is now. We have an awful turnover here. It's due to the fact that so many people, especially at the ---?--- mill work up there---?--- 'Arid---?---. You know, the
husbands get jobs in these mines or these mills, and then they're transferred, and then we lose an operator. Yeah. You talked to
my son up there, didn't youZ
SG: Yeah. Yeah, he mentioned that problem. They'd train somebody,
and right after they'd get done with their training, they'd
leave.
JC: We never had that much trouble. We had--they've kind of gone
back to the old style now. It used to be that they had a lulu of a new deal there that they couldn't hire anybody over about twenty-five or thirty. And then they had to go to about sixty
with them. But I think there are more now. They're getting

 JOHN W. CORBIN #1 PAGE 35
SG: JC: SG: JC: SG: JC:
SG:
some of these older women around here, forty, fifty years old
to go back on switchboard. They depend on them being here more. These married young mine women, when their husbands go, they go too.
Right.
There's so much of that. I'm going to make a list of this---?--- Okay.
You got a lot of information? You record all that on--?
No, no, no, it's been--well, I did up until you start typing. Yeah. I say you've probably got a lot of stuff there that might be some good and might not.
Yeah. Well, is there any other comments you'd like to make, though, about what happened to Moab during the uranium boom?
JC: Make a what?
SG: An additional connnent that you--?
JC: No, I don't know of anything that I can think of. You mean that
did happen?
SG: Yeah, or anything like what you think the future of Moab is.
JC: Well, I look more for the future of Moab to be heavily supported
by tourism--ranching, and livestock, and tourism because I can't see that we're going to make many more big strikes here. Of course, if these mills keep a going, they're going to mean a lot

 JOHN W. CORBIN t/1 PAGE 36
to the economy. And the oil wells have all been a help, but I don't look for---?--- their role. ---?--- can't be what Charly Steen found that ore up there. Back in those days when I was
a young fellow here, my father and I was running this telephone company and I was just working with him part time, and I went
up there to Big Indian and worked in a copper process mill. They were trying to improve the process for getting out---?--- grade copper. And I was all over there. So over in that area
where Charly Steen struck this big find some thirty, thirty-five years later. They just don't know what might be. They might-- we might be sitting on something right here now that will be valuable. But---?---.
SG: Kind of hard to foretell the future?
JC: Yeah. You know, one time they used to throw the uranium away
when they had thes.e mills going at Monticello. Threw the uranium over in the dump; all they wanted was vanadium. Then later it just reversed the other way.
SG: So you don't know what's--so a new mineral might come up and-- JC: Where's this state school at, this state college?
SG: At Fullerton. California State College.
JC: Oh, it's California.
SG: Well, then thank you very much, sir.
