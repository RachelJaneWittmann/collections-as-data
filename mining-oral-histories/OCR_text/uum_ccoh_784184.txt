And the place of birth? (In Italian), Italy.
MB:
GB:
ME:
GB: Italian.
MB: And your religion? GB: Catholic.
And your ethnic group is?
MB: Okay, I would like to start off with some questions concerning your childhood in the old country. I want you to tell me as far back as what you can remember. Any type of story or anything will do, you know, different experiences and that.
GB: Well, in 1921 when my father left, I was just four years old and that's as far as I can remember him and I hadn't seen him until 1933 when I came here . During that time he kept writing to us and sending us money to come, oh how would you say that? Hoping that someday we would come here with him but then things
came up and they didn't work out and in 1933 I came here. The life back there wasn't so good. You would work from morning until night and there wasn't much

 GABRIEL BRUNO #1
to eat. Meat once a week and we raised most of our stuff on the farm.
MB: Now, why did your father come to America, why did he decide to come over to America?
GB: For a better living and for better conditions?
MB: Okay now, let's go back to--let's start off on, well,
your schooling, how old were you when you started school?
GB: I was six.
MB: Six, okay. What were the Italian schools like?
GB: The Italian Schools are similar to this here but
there is no recreation and you study and study and study. You go to school at eight o'clock in the morning and we'd get out at four o'clock in the afternoon and we were allowed one hour for lunch. We don't have a, what you call sports like we have here.
MB: I see. Like, did you go winters and then--
GB: The school is the same as here, it starts in
September and ends in June.
MB: Okay, now what did you do for your summer, during
your summer? Did you work at any job?
GB: Worked on the farm.
MB: What did you mainly do on the farm, did you herd? GB: Raised food for us at home.
MB: What was some of the food?
2

 GABRIEL BRUNO # 1
GB: Well, like tomatoes, corn, wheat, beans, potatoes,
and fruit.
MB: What type of fruit?
GB: Fruit, we had anything you want .
MB: But like you had no goats in that herd, well, what
GB: MB: GB: MB:
GB:
MB:
GB: NB:
GB:
about sheep, livestock?
No, we didn't have any of that, we only had one goat. One goat and you mainly used that for milk.
For milk, cheese, and stuff like that.
Like, then you go back to school, say during the wintertime and you progress from year to year just like the schooling here. Like in second grade what did you basically learn?
Well, second grade is a--well, like I said it is
similar as it is here. Like the first grade is ABC's and then they give you a little book to learn and then in second grade they give you another little book you know, to advance your as you go on.
Like did you learn the Italian alphabet to know the sets, everything was taught in Italian right?
Right.
But it was the same thing say they would teach you here except that it was in a different language and all?
Right.

 GABRIEL BRUNO # 1
MB: Do you remember any of your teachers?
GB: No, no. The teachers they were coming from other
parts of the town and they come in by donkey and they come in every morning and they go home at night. So it was only about two miles that t hey t ravel.
MB: And they were mainly male teachers?
GB: Male teachers, yes .
MB: Could you tell me some of their discipline, ways of
discipline.
GB: Oh (Chuckle) yes, one time we got to school and we
were all waiting for the teacher to come and it was storming and I talked out and said, "Well, the teacher's not coming today because of the bad weather." So all the kids went home. About a half an hour later the teacher came and we were all gone. The next morning I was blamed for that. So he punished me by putting some corn kernels on the floor and he made me knell over that for two hours. So when the other kids were at recess outside I took my pocket knife and I was cutting his ruler, the teacher's ruler. I was just mean. So when he came in the kids were making a lot of noise because I was in the corner on top of the corn. So he hit with his stick on top of the desk and that stick popped right in two. So he said, "Who did this?" Nobody said a word.

 GABRIEL BRUNO # 1
MB: Okay, when did you start working, say at other
places, did you always work in your farm?
GB: When I was eleven years old I went to Sicily for the winter months because on the farm there wasn't much to do and I was helping to gather the olive branches and carrying water for the workers. We were there November, December, January, and February, we came
MB: GB: MB:
GB: MB:
GB:
MB:
GB:
back in March and they were paying oh, it's equivalent to about a dollar and a quarter a day.
Who were you with?
I was with my uncle.
Did anyone else work with you say, you know like, well did everyone come from all over Italy?
From all over the country they came down to Sicily. What else did you do in Sicily, do you remember anything else about that?
Well, it was a beautiful country and that was my job, just carrying the water and gathering these branches while the workers were pruning. We'd tie them up wi t h
bail wire and then they would haul them away.
And a, like, what was I going to ask about that? Do you know like, what other thing did they have going on in Sicily, was there any other type of occupation and work there?
I don't know because we were out in the country. Of 5

 GABRIEL BRUNO # 1
course we have plenty of dago red.
MB: What?
GB: Dago red.
MB: What do you mean by that, a lot of--?
GB: Good wine.
MB: Oh yes, all right. Did you walk from ---?--- down to
Sicily?
GB: Yes, we walked.
MB: What did you see along the way, do you remember any sights like the--
GB: Oh, beautiful sights along the road and you got chestnuts in the wintertime and you got walnuts, you got grapes, oranges.
MB: So really, you didn't have to spend money.
GB: No, we could live off the land.
MB: That's really wonderful there. What did you do for
recreation and celebrations over there in Italy?
GB: Well, on the Saturday night the workers get together and they have an accordion and they make their own music and we'd have what they call it, a get together, dancing. There was a few girls, they come around from the neighborhood and we dance and drink
wine, eat Chestnuts and walnuts. MB: What type of dances did you do? GB: Tarentella.
6

 GABRIEL BRUNO # 1
MB: Tarentella. Do the women dance, they do don't they? GB: Oh yes.
MB: And the men together?
GB: Right.
MB: Like it was mainly accordion music?
GB: Right, it's always accordion music. There was some
American people that were there living that they use
to dance American style.
MB: What type of dance did they--
GB: Just like we dance here.
MB: Oh, so they were over there?
GB: Oh yes.
MB: ---?--- music to the American dance.
GB: Well, that's people that they've been in this country
and then they went back and they stayed there.
MB: What type of celebration other than this did they
have as far as Christmas?
GB: Well, they have Christmas, they have Easter, and when
it's about oh six or eight celebrations they have
like a fair. Like exhibits and all that.
MB: What type of exhibits?
GB: Oh like they bring eggs, fruit, pigs, and chickens.
Well, most of what they raise on the farm. MB: And then judges award what is better?
GB: Right.
7

 GABRIEL BRUNO # 1
MB: What else do they have going on during it, just the
music and the dancing?
GB: And a lot of people they come from the big cities and
they like ice cream, they bring ice cream and they bring clothing out there right in the river where they have this fair and people would buy them, like straw hats, we buy them there, shoes. It's just like a big store.
MB: So that's how you got say your yearly clothing, your suits and that?
GB: Right, right.
MB: That's interesting because I've always wondered how
people were able to buy their clothing, they made them right there on the farm from the sheep wool or what not.
GB: Well, we do make a lot of clothing ourself, we do make a lot of--
MB: A lot of knitting.
GB: And we have what you call a, it's like a mill. The
MB: GB:
women, they weave all this stuff that is made out of ---?---
Say it in Italian, you can say it in Italian.
It's made out of Leno (?) and this Leno (?) has been
processed and they make the twine out of it and then they weave it through the mill and make your sheets
8

 GABRIEL BRUNO # 1
and make ah your material for shirts for dresses, pillow cases, for blankets, and all that stuff goes on their.
MB: Like what made you decide to come to America other than your father being here, is that your only reason.
GB: I was tired of working so hard.
MB: Really, and you thought that you might find an easier
life.
GB: I thought it was an easier life over here which it
was.
MB: Tell some of the preparation that you went through to
come over to America like you know, where you got the ticket and how you're- -you know, if you had connections over here in America to help you and you're Uncle is helping you and that.
GB: Well, in 1932 when my dad sent for me, we hired a lawyer to take care of all my papers.
MB: GB:
A lawyer in Italy?
It was in Italy yes and before he got through with my papers he died, passed away and nobody could find the papers. So we had to send, write to my dad to send me some more papers because the guy passed away and we were lost. So late in '32 we got the papers from my dad and we start all over again. In 1933 in July they
9

 GABRIEL BRUNO # 1
were all completed and I left back there. While I was leaving home, a young girl said to me, "God bless you." She said, "You're going to a good country." The
same lady I see her in 1965 in Canada when I go to visit with my mother and I've visited them every time
I've been in Canada. MB: Who is she?
GB: Her name is Miss Caputo, she's a cousin of Nick Buzzo.
MB: Oh really?
GB: Uh huh.
MB: Neat.
GB: We got from my place we went to Naples and from
Naples then I got on another--you know, we went through Amatea, from Amatea to Naples and from Naples we went to Genoa.
MB: Now how did you get to Amatea?
GB: á By walking and a donkey.
MB: Now everyone seems to have had to take that route on
walking though there is no really big train or
transportation.
GB: No, if there was we couldn't afford it. Then on July
16 I left by boat.
[END OF SIDE ONE]

 GABRIEL BRUNO # 1
MB: Did you say it in Italian?
GB: Yes, I said it in Italian. So she laughed and she
says, "The time is" I don't remember the time and what it was but it between one and two o'clock in the morning and then we were just outside of Denver. So then she said, "Well, this is Anna, an Italian." I said, "Do you speak it?" She said, "Yes." We had a ball clear from Denver to Helper. When I got to Helper she went on to Salt Lake City and I got off which my dad wasn't there, there was a fellow by the name of Vince Lamone, Jim Reale, Gee Huraley, and Pascuzzi. About fifteen minutes later my father came
and they took me home here in Spring Glen.
MB: Tell me about your impressions of the country around here, of Carbon County when you first got off. Were
you kind of frightened about the place?
GB: Well, I was kind of disappointed in the way the country looked here but as I went along it improved I
enjoyed it.
MB: You know, I got a picture of Italy being similar, you
know as far as the land and the terrain goes, I kind
of picture them being similar to Italy, did they?
GB: No, the terrain back there is a lot different than it is here. You got a--especially in the summertime. You
don't see much desert like you have here because most 11

 G A B R I E L BRUNO # 1
of the terrain has been cultivated and there are some more trees and some more barns and more livestock. Here you can go for miles and you never see no trees or no livestock or nothing .
How long did your overall trip take corning here? You know, from Italy to--
MB:
GB:
MB:
GB:
MB: GB: MB:
GB: MB: GB: MB: GB:
I left horne on the 12th of July and I got here on the 23rd of July.
Okay, 1ike when you carne to Carbon County, how did they introduce you to the area, like when did you start your schooling? What time of year did you come? I carne here in July, that was in the summertime and I started school in the fall or September, I went to Notre Dame.
What grade did you start it?
I started in the first grade?
What did you think of riding the school bus, did you ever ride one over in Italy?
No, I thought that was great.
You really liked it then?
Yes.
Oh, I see.
The only thing that bothered me, that threw me were those little kids. Like Jane, Dick, cat, and dog.
12

 GABRIEL BRUNO # 1
MB: Oh, the American kids huh. Yes. Oh, I don't know. But
it's amazing really, how far advanced they are over in Italy as far as learning processes go compared to here in America, do you know what I mean. You were probably more grown up and advanced at your age say as six years old then they would have never of been. Do you know what I mean?
GB: The schools in the European countries is far better than what we have here because we don't fool ar ound . We studied. What the kids learn here in the twelve grades the kids back in the old country they got it on the eighth grade.
MB:
GB: MB: GB:
MB:
GB: MB: GB : MB:
You know, this is really true. Like what was your first impression of having a nun for a teacher? Like, did they have a lot of nuns over in Italy?
They have them.
But they didn't teach school?
No, they didn't impress me because I've seen them and that was just another job for them.
Yes. (Chuckle) Okay, how long did you go down to Notre Dame?
I went two years.
And then you started what other school? Then I went to Spring Glen here .
Uh huh and you were here how long?
13

 GABRIEL BRUNO # 1
GB: One year.
MB: Who were some of your teachers, do you remember any? GB: Miss Buchanan, Rolly, and Pace. That's all I can
remember.
MB: Let's see, now like you started your job, you quit
school at what age all together?
GB: I was nineteen when I quit school in Spring Glen here
and in the fall my dad says, "You go to school or you go find yourself a job." So I went to work at Castle Gate with John Bruno from Helper and then from Castle Gate we went up to Soldier Summit and built some snow fences. When we got through up there then we come back to Castle Gate and start cleaning some of those coal cars that were full of ice and we had to clean them. So then I talked to Jim Westfield and he was the mine foreman, if he could get me a job inside and he said, "Well, you're too young."
MB: How old did you have to be?
GB: I had to be twenty-one.
MB: Was that the law and the rule all together?
GB: Yes.
MB: When was that enforced, do you know when it was
enforced? Was that the law that you had to be twenty-
one?
GB: No, I didn't.
14

 GABRIEL BRUNO # 1
MB: You weren't around with any of the mining strikes or
anything?
GB: No. So I lied to them and told them that I was
twenty-one. He said, "You're not a day over
nineteen." MB: Who was that?
GB: Mr. Westfield. He says, "But we let you go by, we will put down twenty-one." So I went to work in a coal mine with my dad and I worked there from '37 to 1941 in April when I left for the service.
MB: Did you ever expect to go back to Italy ever, well before you left for the service?
GB: Well, I had an intention to go back and see my mother. But my mother in 1939 we lost contact, we couldn't get no mail, no telegrams, nothing.
MB: Well, why was this?
GB: It was during the war.
MB: During the war, so it was cut off altogether?
GB: We were cut off and from '39 to '45 I didn't hear a
word until I got back there and then the Red Cross wrote me a letter that my mother and my sister were okay. Six months after I got that letter I was in Luxembourg, Germany and I got a thirty day leave and
I went to Italy to see my mother.
MB: Were you an American citizen when you did enter the
15

 GABRIEL BRUNO # 1 army?
GB:
MB: GB: MB: GB:
You bet.
Did you have to be?
Yes, I was an American citizen since 1939.
What were you going to say?
Well, I was going to say that I found my mother and my sister and they were okay but everything was bombed and they were pretty scarce on everything like
food and clothing. I had a little money and I left it to my mother when I left. Then I went back to Germany and in June of 1945, no, yes June of 1945 and then in August, the 26th I left Europe and I come back to the United States and I got discharged on the 26th of September.
Uh huh. Then what did you do after you came back here? Did you buy yourself a car?
No, I already had a car. I went to work for my father-in-law in Nevada tending a bar and I didn't like it. I worked there thirty days and then I went to work for Civil Service in Fort Douglas, Utah. I was there one year and then they closed up. I then left Salt Lake and I went back to Nevada and worked for a fellow by the name of McMillian who was running a chain store called Sewer's United and I was there for four years. Then in 1950 I said to myself, "If I
MB:
GB:
16

 GABRIEL BRUNO # 1
can make money for somebody else then I can make money for myself," and I started my own in '50. Me and my brother-in-law we opened up a small market and we worked together until 1969 when we sold out and he is still working and I'm retired.
MB: I see. So how old are you now and at what age did you retire?
GB: Fifty-one and a half.
MB: Fifty-one and a half at the age of retirement. So
then you mainly got your living through financ i ng
would you say?
GB: I got enough to live on.
MB: Right on through finances .
GB: Right.
MB: It's amazing what an immigrant can do; come over to
America and achieve. What would you say about your
life overall, would you say that it's been, you know? GB: Life's been great.
MB: Really. Up to now?
GB: I got a happy home and two nice kids.
MB: That's great really. Okay, thank's that was
really great . I enjoyed it . GB: Thank you .
