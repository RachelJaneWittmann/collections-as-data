SG: As an introduction to the tape, can you give a little background on yourself?
RM:
We11 , I was born and raised in Moab here . After completing my high school education, I was inducted into the service in 1945. After I got out of the service, I came back and went to work in the grocery store, the General Merchandise Store, here with my father. Since that time I had the opportunity to buy out a portion of the business, and have been managing it ever since 1946. We had a small store down on Main Street across from First Security Bank. When the uranium business started to take hold, when Charlie Steen had made his big discovery out here, why, business started picking up. They put parallel parking on the highway and parking meters all the way around so we became quite congested on the corner. We carried groceries clear to the county courthouse many times in taking care of our customers. We felt we had to get out a ways from the main traffic, so we moved out into the shopping center on the south end of town and built a new store out there in 1957. We
continued to operate out there in the grocery business. SG: Going on into what happened during the uranium boom, can you give us some impression of what it was like to go to

 RALPH MILLER JR. #1
school in Moab before World War Two? What was the town like?
RM: Well, at that time we had probably a total population of about twelve hundred people, and I'm not so sure that some of the dogs and cats wasn't counted in to get that many people. But the schools was, of course, not crowded. They did build a new junior high. In fact, they had all the grades together in the school up here at the time. While it was being constructed, some of us did have to go into the old LDS church and also the old Mormon building up here where the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers are. I don't really know what else to say. I mean, if you got some specific question on something, I think possibly I could answer.
SG: Well, to continue on the schools, how would you compare the curriculum you had then to what's being taught now?
RM: I think we had practically the same subjects that they do now. I won't say right now. I mean as far as when we had, say, the uranium boom on, I think it was pretty much the same. I can't think of any major changes in education or any different subjects, really, than what we had the opportunity to take.
SG: Well, how about in the community itself? How much cooperation was there between people? Did most people know each other?
2

 RALPH MILLER JR. #1
RM: Oh, yes, very well. If you're talking about cooperation
with the schools and this type of thing, I don't think we've ever had a bond issue here that they haven't gone for a hundred percent. I mean as far as education is concerned, as far as schools are concerned. There was a real hub-de-do and a lot of interest in the new school building that they were talking about as far as floating the new bond issue when uranium, you might say, was at its peak. Then it looked like it might possibly be phased out. I know that a lot of the people in the uranium business were fighting this expansion program on the schools at the time, telling them the people that remained here were going to end up having to pay for these schools, and that there would be no payroll in the area, and this type of thing. So, there were various factors on that, but it still passed.
SG: As a young boy in Moab, what was the usual day like for you? What kinds of things would you do for recreation?
RM: Well, of course, for myself it was hunting and fishing. I always did like to do this. Practically all of the spare time I had, this is about what I done. There was, oh, quite a bit of activity in your summer months, like your baseball. We used to have softball leagues. We used to do that practically every evening. Of course, there was
nothing like a bowling alley. I think they had a show
3

 RALPH MILLER J R . #1
once a week. But most of it was just more or less sports, you might say.
SG: Did most of the community become involved in the different sports?
RM: Oh, very much so. That and any kind of--oh, like your community picnics, and this type of thing. It was strictly kind of a small town atmosphere, I guess you might say. Everybody seemed to cooperate real well together.
JD: When the boom actually hit, what kind of shifts in business did you have to make to accommodate this large number of people?
RM: Like I said a while ago, when the boom really hit, we plain did not have floor space enough nor room enough to check people out. We had people waiting in line sometimes clear back to our meat counters. We had to lengthen our store hours. I think the latest we even closed during the boom was around seven o'clock in the evening. We used to always open up usually from eight to six, and I think we lengthened it to seven. Then we finally started opening
on Sundays in order to take care of it. Then, of course, there was no other direction to go by the time they started putting parking meter in and the parallel parking situation. We was forced to make a change, that's all. It
was either get in or get out.

JD: RM: JD: RM:
JD:
RM:
How about employees?
Well, you mean the number of employees that we had? Correct.
Gosh, I don't remember right off hand now. I would say
that considering our part-time help, we had around twelve employees.
Did you ever have any trouble with any particular portion of your market, your meats or your dairy products or your vegetables, when the big supply came nd you had to get the products in?
Well, of course, delivery was a big problem then. I mean, as far as not having storage space. We almost had to have daily service on things to keep up with it. I think probably the major part of our business--I mean the big thing that sticks in my mind that caused us more difficulty than anything was that we had always been in business. I mean, as you heard Mr. Balsley say a minute ago, it's been passed more or less down through the family. We used to do about 70 percent charge and about 30 percent cash. We didn't swing our accounting system fast enough. I mean, our charging was just about on the
same ratio. Naturally, everybody is hungry for business, you know, and here comes some guy, and the first thing you know, you had pretty good experience with him, and then maybe some of his relatives moved out when they
5

 RALPH MILLER JR. #1
heard the boom was on, and there was a good place to get a job and all this kind of stuff. So the first thing you know, why, he'd introduce you to some of his relatives, and you'd set up an account with them and try to operate the same way as we used to, more or less taking people on their word and taking them for what you thought they was worth, so to speak, and trusting them. We had some real sad experiences for about two years before we finally work up to the fact that we just couldn't continue to operate a credit business. After you'd get all through at the end of the year and get your audits made and this type of thing, why, really, you worked for nothing. That's about all you can say. So we had some tough credit losses during this period.
JD: Did you then resolve to go to a strictly cash and carry business?
RM: Yes. You always have some accounts that you can't go strictly on a cash basis with. I mean, we had some company accounts and some mining accounts and people of this nature that you just had to carry that way if you wanted the business. These people we didn't get hurt
with. It was more or less the construction people as well
as the miners themselves that hurt us like that.
JD: Did you explain to a lot of these individuals why this change had to come about? Were they pretty understanding
6

 RALPH MILLER JR. #1
about the changeover?
RM: Yes, most of them were. Really, we never noticed too much drop in volume even after we swung. In fact, about the only way we could see to approach the thing was to tell people. We would say, in our advertisement and letters that we sent out to our accounts, "We don't expect you to pay your account that you presently owe us and then turn right around and operate on cash. We would prefer that maybe you go ahead and operate the next two weeks or month on a cash basis, and then possibly give us ten or fifteen, twenty dollars, or whatever you can on your back bill until you eventually get it caught up." So we didn't have too much repercussion on this kind of bill. But it's kind of like anything. When you've been doing it for the past twenty or thirty years, you might say, and then you turn around and try to convert people, you eventually find yourself sliding just a little bit. The first thing you know, you're back in the credit business again. But
we've never got ourselves back into that kind of shape since then. It would be more like 70 percent cash and 30 percent credit now. Immediately when we switched this, I don't think we ever went over fifty-fifty on that kind of basis, even when you slip back a ways on credit.
JD: Did you ever have any trouble with legal proceedings during the boom? Did you instigate legal proceedings
7

 RALPH
RM:
SG: RM:
JD: RM: JD: RM:
MILLER J R . #1
against any of these people that didn't pay?
Some of them, yes. Really the tough ones had gone by the wayside, and you just couldn't seem to find an attorney that would want to take this kind of a deal. The attorneys that we had were all active and mixed up in uranium, handling claims, all this kind of stuff. So as a result, they didn't care to handle accounts receivables. I think this was the farthest thing from their mind, and I guess you can't blame them.
Small change for them?
Yeah. Heck yeah, and probably time wasted on something like this. So as far as trying to pursue them, when there were skips and all, we tried outside sources as far as turning our accounts receivable over to them on this type of people, which never did work out at all.
When did you try to expand the store you had?
Beyond just the food market itself?
Right. Beyond the food market itself.
Well, let's put it this way. We always was in general merchandise. We had everything from saddles to horseshoes to dry good to furniture. In 1955, we built what is known as the Uranium Building now. We moved all of our dry good department into that portion of the new building and kept the corner there for the groceries. Up over the balcony there, we had our furniture and sporting goods and this
8

 RALPH
MILLER J R . #1
type of thing. In '57, we moved out to the shopping center. We didn't have the whole shopping center at that time. It was a building of 100 by 150 for the grocery business. Here again, we expanded our variety and selection, but we still had the groceries, meats, produce, frozen foods, and the hardware 1ines. Then we expanded again our dry goods lines in both buildings down here on the corner. Then in 1962, we added on to the shopping center, moved the clothing store out next to us, and then subleased out the various premises there for the laundry, barber shop, had a beauty shop in there at the time, and then, of course, the chamber of commerce. The chamber of commerce we had always donated space to. At one time they were located in our office building over our stores that was downtown. When we moved out of there, they had always felt they would rather have ground level, actually, and so then we made this space available to them up there.
JD: How long did you maintain a monopoly on the food business? When did City Market come in?
RM: Well, City Market moved in in '61, I guess.
JD: Up until then did you maintain almost a monopoly?
RM: No. In fact, I think we probably had more competition
then than we do right today. That is, Bill McCormick moved in from Dove Creek, Colorado in the store down here
9

 RALPH MILLER JR. #1
on 38 East Center, the store that we just acquired from Mr. Yama here about in March of this year. But Bill put in this store there, and he put in general merchandise. That store there is about 190 feet long by about 50 wide, and so it was a big store. There were several smaller markets operating around throughout Moab at the time, too. So there was by no means a monopoly. I mean, we didn't have the chain competition that we do now when we refer to City Market, but we did have strong independent competition. I don't remember how many stores there was at the time. I'd say there was about six or seven different stores here.
JD: When you comment about the miners themselves, were the miners the ones most likely to go on a type of account where credit would be the main way of purchasing? Do you think the miners, say, before the boom were pretty good at paying up once they came into it? In other words, did they pretty much square accounts when they actually did have money?
RM: Oh, definitely. In fact, you take most all the miners themselves, I don't think we ever lost a dime on any of them. I mean, local miners, so to speak, in the surrounding area, Blanding, Monticello, and settling out through here, especially those people that had mines
operating as such. They had excellent credit. We just 10

 RALPH MILLER J R . #1
never had any problems. They were slow sometimes, maybe, getting their ore shipment settlement checks and this type of thing. But I can't think of a one of these that we took it from.
SG: Can you give us some idea in terms of a cash figure what these losses were that you were talking about? An approximate figure?
RM: Well, you know, percentage-wise, they don't stick in my mind now, I remember this, that we tried to write off on year seventy thousand dollars. The federal government wouldn't allow us to do it. We had to split it up into two years. Actually, they ended up being bad, you might say. There was some recovery against this, but we figured we had a seventy thousand dollar loss write-off in business that year. Like I say, they wouldn't allow us to take that large a write-off, we had to split it up into a couple, three years on the thing. Of course, you always have some recoveries back against this. Percentage-wise
what this was now, the figures just don't stick to my mind. But I think I can safely state it was well over 50 percent that we ended up writing off. You know, in those days, that was a hell of a lot of money. It is today, as far as that part's concerned. But it about broke our back actually, this credit business, by letting it get that far out of hand. It's true, we was doing a good volume of
11

 RALPH
JD: RM: JD:
RM:
MILLER J R . #1
business.
Were a lot of these debts for more than just groceries? Oh yes. Hardware, dry goods.
In other words, they could pretty much come out and equip themselves to go out in the field from your store?
This is very true. We had everything, like I say, from tents on down to a nice couch set. I mean, a lot of this was even furniture that went into some of the homes. I can think of a lot of high promoters that we had here in town that really went first class. I don't suppose you particularly want their names on this tape, but yeah, we took some bumps out of them too. I mean, promoters, so to speak.
You mean the people that had to have a big show room to sell their stock, or what?
Oh, that, or say even renting an apartment. They went in
JD:
RM:
and completely redecorated. There was nothing too good, you know, as far as the furniture that went into this thing; they were trying to be real impressive, you know. We furnished several of those places. Part of this loss that I was telling you about was done by them. It wasn't just groceries. Like I say, it was just general
merchandise right on down the line.
SG: Do you think you were the major supplier for most of the
people in the valley, or did they buy elsewhere? Were
12

 RALPH MILLER J R . #1
people always content with what was happening at Miller's Market? Or if they got discontented, would they go all the way down to Monticello of Blanding to shop?
RM: I would say it this way. Prior to the time that we built the new store, we had one heck of a lot of business going to Grand Junction, Colorado. I mean, really, they were our big competitor. Living in a small town, I think we all appreciate, that people want to get away. I mean, naturally, there is more variety, more selection and this type of thing, so people always look for something to do on the weekend. There wasn't a lot of activity going on, so I think a lot of people went over there and shopped. In a sense of the word, you couldn't blame them because, like I said before, we had had customers backed up clear down to our meat counter. We had the aisles full with customers trying to get checked out. You couldn't expect people to wait in line this long, or you couldn't expect
people to come in and not find a place to park. Like I said, they'd park maybe up to the county courthouse and walk down to get their groceries. In many cases, we would maybe carry their groceries to their car for them. But there was many times when we just didn't have staff enough to do it, and what have you. People would end up carrying their own groceries. I don't think we lot of business or had a lot of people leaving Moab, going to
13

 RALPH MILLER JR. #1
Monticello or Blanding, or anything like this. And vice versa, I don't think that a lot of those people came down here. I think that everybody had just about all they could take care of at the time.
JD: A question that I have revolves around this. When I ask people about the prices in the area, they say that they have remained pretty much the same. The question in my mind is, if a person came in on a Friday or a Saturday, and the only place in town to buy was at these markets, why didn't you raise prices, just to make increased profit?
RM: Well, I don't know. I guess it's probably the spirit of competition that always keeps you competitive. In fact, I think we fought a lot harder to be right honest with you and tried to maintain our prices competitive. I won't say that's any more than what we do now. I think competition keeps you this way, as far as this part's concerned. But I don't know. I guess probably if you let your hindsight
guide your foresight sometimes, maybe this would have been a good deal to do. I don't know. I don't think that this thing occurred--not with anybody that I can think of.
SG: Do you recall during the time when the boom came if there was any one item that all of a suddeán there was a real big demand on? Was there a big demand on
14

 RALPH MILLER J R . #1
meats, a big demand on cheese, a big demand on anything?
RM: No, I think it was pretty much a genera1 run of merchandise. Fresh meats, of course, was always one of our better sellers. Like I say, the only way we could keep up with that kind of deal was to bring in deliveries more often. We was running a locker plant at the time,
too. We had frozen facilities and all. Of course, they were all filled up, and we had a waiting list of, oh, I don't recall, forty or fifty people, trying to get lockers, waiting for someone to cancel out and all. But I can't think of anything in particular that there was an exceptionally heavy run on.
SG: Did you have any problems with workers, recruiting them and keeping them, during this period?
RM: Well, here again, Steve, I don't think we had any more than we do now. Our deal was pretty much a family setup. I think we was pretty much fortunate in being able to
work various members of the family into the business. It's true we could not compete in the retail business with your mines and places like this. It never has been this way in the retail business that it's paid as much money. Really, we never had too many problems as far as employment was concerned. Like I say, we didn't carry a big staff at that time; probably had twelve, fourteen
15

 RALPH MILLER J R . #1
people. Probably out of that twelve, fourteen people, by the time we took the various members of the family working out of it, we probably didn't have six people working in the store that wasn't in the family.
JD: You didn't have any conditions like in California where the retail clerks came in and unionized the store?
RM: No, I think everyone was living too fast at that timi and never had time to get organized like that.
SG: Has there been any drive for a union of the retail store clerks in this area?
RM: I don't know, unless it's not enough members. I'm sure they've done some surveys. I know they've come and talked to various employees of mine. I just don't feel that they felt that could get our employees. I don't think they felt they could get enough people to go with them. I don't know. I think basically that most all of the business places have been quite fair with their personnel. They've tried, that probably, I think, to keep
a fairly good pay scale. I would say it's up to union scale like it is in California or some of your metropolitan area, but if you look at it over the state as a whole, based on the population as a whole, I think Moab's always been pretty fair in the wages that have been paid.
SG: Have the problems that the telephone company had caused
16

 RALPH
RM:
SG:
RM:
MILLER J R . #1
your outfit any special problems especially during the uranium boom?
Oh, brother, yeah. As far as trying to get calls in and out of here and this type of thing. I suppose that is probably what you're referring to.
Right.
And yes, it was bound to. Just like I mentioned before, where we had to have almost daily delivery on merchandise
because of not having back room storage enough or walk-in storage enough for our perishable products. It was a real problem.
Can you recall any particular incidents that occurred from this?
Not offhand. I know that we had a number of them, but
SG:
RM:
there is no one in particular that stands out in my mind. JD: Were a 1ot of your vegetab1es and a 1ot of your
perishable crops bought locally?
RM: No, at that time, I would probably say none. Moab used to
be a fairly good farming community. Before people started moving in on this uranium, I don't think there was probably a place in Moab that didn't have a garden spot of a little orchard. But as soon as they started making places available for trailers, they started cleaning out their gardens and their orchards and even went on into some of the larger divisions as far as the trailer parks
17

 RALPH
MILLER J R . #1
and stuff is concerned. But most everybody that had a garden spot either had one or two trailers sitting in that garden spot. So there was just nothing raised locally, just little stuff. Moab used to be a big in shipping their fruit, and especially for their peach harvest and all. They had two packing sheds going at one time and all. And that even went by the wayside. I mean, they just cleaned out the orchards and started housing and trailer spots and this type of thing. So very little stuff was raised here.
SG: Did this cause special problems for you?
RM: No, not too much really. It's always a tough thing to
really try to handle local produce on a small basis. I mean, you take Moab right here today. There's nobody's that's in it big enough, and as a result they just have a little dab, you might say. And also, you can't get the uniformity that you need in produce. You get a bushel of cucumbers. You get big ones, little ones, and everything else. You know, you just can't sell it in a grocery store. You've got to have pretty much uniform size all the way through. Truck gardening as such in the produce end of it has never been a bad thing. Most of the big business done on local stuff was in the fruits, the peaches as an example, and apples and this type of thing. We still sell and awful lot of this. I think between the
18

 RALPH MILLER J R . #1
local stores here, we pretty much handle all the stuff that's raised right here in Moab.
SG: So actually in some ways it was easier that you didn't have these people asking to buy this local stuff anymore? RM: Well, I won't say anymore. I mean there's still people,
of course, that want local produce. SG: Which is great.
RM: Yeah. This is great. This is right. It is probably better. But what I'm saying is that we don't get enough local product to be able to handle it through the store and do any kind of volume on it at all. This morning on the bulletin board are people who are advertising for a bushel of cucumbers, or anybody who's got tomatoes for sale, and this kind of stuff, you know, the swap-it club that they have on our radio station. We sure don't feel bad about this or anything like this. Well, naturally, you'd rather see them buy locally. Our product business generally falls off during the summer months. But where
we fall off there, why, maybe we'll pick back up on watermelons, cantaloupes, and other volume items of this type, things they don't raise here like potatoes.
JD: Where do you get most of your meats from?
RM: Most all of our meats come out of the Salt Lake City
area. I should say Denver and Salt Lake. SG: Has this always been the case?
19

 RALPH MILLER JR. #1
RM: Yes. I guess I shouldn't say that either. We did start a
packing house, a federally inspected packing house, over there in Delta, Colorado, in 1966. So most of our meat at that time cameá out of that packing house. At the present time we have that leased out to another firm. Our freight is the problem now as far as trying -to get it in. In other words, what we're pulling back in a load out of Denver or Salt Lake, where they're pulling shipments, you might say, for the various stores as well as for the other commodities, why, they can make a freight haul pay. But we'd have to make a special trip just to go there and pick up meat and come back. They don't have the variety. It's not a large packing house. It's mostly straight beef. Unless you're able to mix your pork products and your cheese and lamb and all the poultry and all this kind of stuff, why, it just doesn't justify a haul.
SG: Has the isolation of this area caused you a lot of problems with transportation?
RM: Oh, I think transportation has always been our biggest problem, really. I think transportation has always held this whole end of the state up, whether it be ourselves traveling by plane or whatever, or whether it be getting commodities in and out of here. I'd probably say more in than out. Freight's always been a tough deal and still is
as far as that part's concerned. It's improved 20

 RALPH MILLER JR. #1
considerably because we've got a few more carriers than we had in the boom days. I think we had one common carrier in here at that time, Garrett Freightline, and that was it. They had about all they could handle. Whereas now, we've got Wycoff, we've got the Four Corners Trucking, We've got air freight in here that we never had before, and a few things like this, so it's not nearly as bad as it was. But I still feel that even today it's one of the main factors holding the area back. You can take a an example here, when they freight thes~ products in our area here out of Denver, Colorado, our freight rate is $4.28 a pound. You know, whenever you go to price your merchandise, you naturally figure this in your markup. Whenever you do this, you price yourself, say, a nickel a pound higher than what they are in a surrounding town or something, and it makes you look like you're a daylight robber, so to speak. But you can turn right around on the thing, and where these outlying areas like Grand Junction, where they've got rail in there and the many trucking operations going in and out of there, why, they're laying their freight in there for anyplace around a cent, cent and a half. So it makes quite a little
difference if you're talking about the margins.
SG: Did you get many protests from the new people that came into the area over prices, not realizing the problems
21

 RALPH MILLER J R . #1
with the transportation?
RM: Did you get many protests from the new people that came into the area over prices, not realizing the problems with the transportation?
RM: I think this has always been a consistent thing. I can think of one incident in particular where the mill personnel had met and had gone and talked to the management and asked them about a wage increase, pointing out and stating that the cost of living here in Moab was just too high, and that they felt that they should have an increase in wages. So they met with a group of the retail merchants committee that we had formed at that time, and laid the thing down, pointing out that several things such as groceries, housing, gasoline, building supplies, and this type of thing were much higher than they were in the surrounding areas, and that their employees had approached them for a raise. So we asked them to go ahead and take a survey, to do an actual
phys i ca 1 survey , by taking one of their commit tee , picking a chairman from the employees themselves as far as representation was concerned, and if at all possible we would like to have somebody from the retail industry chamber of commerce to represent the businessmen, and they can actually do a survey, which they done. They surveyed Price, Grand Junction, Durango, Cortez, and all
22

 RALPH
MILLER J R . #1
the surrounding area here. After the survey was made, why, they did come back and tell us that as far as the retail price on groceries and all, that they thought we were very competitive. There was some ups and some downs, but very little differential in this. Housing, of course, has always been a problem, and probably always will be. It may not be that was as it exists right today, but then it's just like anything else. It's your supply and your demand, and it's just one of those things. I feel that we had a situation here not so very long ago that came back on this same kind of deal. You know, what people á do is they will move into a community--we'll say they've beat around the bush for two or three months, and maybe they move into the community. Then they take and, say, compare your price then when it was when they moved out of that last town, and don't realize that naturally on your price you've had almost, oh, I think you can say consistently 5 to 10 percent price increases that continue to grow, you know, on various items.
SG: You mean, throughout the country?
RM: Through the country, yeah. So that if they're in other
words, comparing you on a can of peas down in there, we'll say, Farmington, New Mexico, comparing what they were down there versus what they are up here, and that was six months ago when they lived there or something,
23

 RALPH
MILLER J R . #1
why, it's really not a fair comparison, I mean, unless we done it at exactly the same time on the thing. You see the same fluctuation happening, especially like in your meats and things like this, where your market can change within five to ten cents a pound over a period of two or
three weeks on some items. But anyway, this is one thing that was pointed out in this survey that came up here, even a couple of years ago. We had this same thing happen. So we asked for a price comparison at that time because a lot of workers, like I say, had probably worked five or six different jobs and then they moved back into Moab and then was comparing prices maybe with what they were here six months ago. Another thing that people do-- well, immediately they'll pick up a paper and they'll compare a shop price maybe with an advertised special. This isn't always a fair comparison as we know because we have out ads too, you know, like our weekend specials. I don't think that price has been the big thing as far as we're concerned. I think that probably maybe variety and selection would have more to do with it than anything. I'm sure that you can get comments on both sides as far as that's concerned. We've noticed this even after we moved back into the shopping are where we did carry more variety and selection and all. I think it has just steadily increased from that point on that Moab became
24

 RALPH
MILLER J R . #1
more of a shopping community. We actually found we had a lot of people out of Green River and Hanksville and Naturita and Nucla and Paradox and La Sal and some of the
outlying mining areas, and even some people out of Blanding and Monticello that came into Moab each week to shop. Of course, here again, we had such things as Sprouse-Reitz variety moved in, a variety store, your Gamble's your Firestone, and your various places like this, so that we did get more variety and selection to choose from. I really think that we have equally as many people coming in to shop as we did have going out to find special items. Another thing I think that caused a lot of this, and I don't think anybody can deny it, is where you have specialty men like your optometrists and maybe dentists. People maybe have to have a specialist or maybe they don't particularly like the doctor that is there, or the lawyer, or something like this. So I'm sure a lot of these people went out to town for specialty services. I think that still exists right today. Of course, you don't have too many lawyers here in Moab. You've got two lawyers, really. You've got a county attorney and you've got a city attorney, and they're both doing this kind of work as well as the other business stuff. So I know there's a lot of people here that use outside
professional service.

So in other words, they're going out for other reasons, but while they're out, they then do retail shopping besides?
This is true. This is true. Suppose you get a situation where there's a junior prom going on . There isn't really a merchant in town that can afford to lay out the sizes and varieties and this kind of stuff or prom dresses for the girls, you might say. So naturally, you've got something like this going all the time.
Do you have any problems with automobile prices here, or are the automobiles pretty competitive with, say, Grand Junction?
Oh, I think they're pretty competitive, but you still have an awful lot of it going on, I mean, as far as people going outside and buying automobiles.
In other words, a lot of the problems are just the size of the town?
That, and there's some people, it wouldn't matter, you know. When you get to pinning people down something, it's really kind of comical. I mean, it's kind of like trying to compare insurance policies, if you've ever tried to do this like on a health program, you know, where one of
them has a twenty-dollar room benefit and the other has a fifty-dollar room benefit and the next one pays 80 percent and the next one pays 20 percent, and all this
26

 RALPH
MILLER J R . #1
kind of stuff. You find the same kind of thing in automobiles. You'll have a guy come and say, "Well, I want such and such for the price of this automobile," and he paid a thousand dollars, while the guy over here at Grand Junction, Colorado went and bought the same thing
for eight hundred. But when you start checking back on the thing as far as the condition of the car, the size of the tires, the radio, heater, so on and so forth, it's a real good question whether he really did buy it that much cheaper. So I don't know. It's always happened, and it's going to continue to happen. I don't care what the conditions are, why, you're always going to have some of that, I think.
SG: Has the increased tourism in the area changed your business in any way?
RM: Uh, volume-wise? Of course, this is awfully hard to say. I mean, yes, we've noticed quite an increase in some line and all of it from tourism. At the same time, though, I think when we say this, it's an awfully hard question because at the same time when tourism was picking up, the
mining and the milling activity was falling off. We can take Texas Gulf Sulphur here as an example, where they have been on a decline for the past couple of years. The same thing when we had Atlas Minerals catch fire out here, and burn the biggest part of the mill down, so they
27

 MILLER J R . #1
had to lay off out there. At the same time, you had a lot of your ore contracts running out, so it's cut down there. At the same time, tourism has picked up the biggest part of this. But when you say that you've actually had an increase in business from the thing, I don't think we can say this. We've had naturally an increase in tourism, and thank God we've had it because it sure has picked up the slack on things. A lot of it we've noticed was with the campers and all. I think you get maybe mixed emotions from motel people sometimes because they don't like to see these campers around; naturally, they'd rather have them stay at a motel and all. But at the same time, we've got three motels where we used to have one here before. So tourism has definitely helped out.
SG: Well, how about certain items being more in demand now that you have tourism? Are there any special demands made on the business because of this, say one item is sold more now than before?
RM: I don't think we notice it so much. I think probably some of your specialty places like Gelo's place down here that caters strictly to the tourist type for souvenirs and this type of thing, I think probably more so. About the biggest thing that I notice would probably be our film
and this type of thing, basically. Suntan lotion. 28
RALPH

 RALPH MILLER J R . #1
JD: What about beer?
RM: Beer is always big--beer and pop and bread and milk. Of
course, this goes right with their camper-type operation. We notice this. You know, these people really don't usually come in and just buy a great big order of fifty or sixty dollars. They'll buy a lot of five and ten dollar orders which consist almost basically of your perishable merchandise.
SG: Well then, to reward the question, do you notice a seasonal trend more in your business now coming in with the tourism?
RM: Definitely, yeah. Well, here again, when you say seasonal, yes, we're busier in the summer months now. Still, our better months are like October, November, and December in our type of operation. Of course, October is deer season, elk season, and hunting season, so to speak, in general. We get an awful lot of people in on that. Now I don't know whether you want to classify those people as tourists or not.
SG: Well, anybody that's just traveling through would be a tourist.
RM: That's real big business for us. I mean, October is one of our best months. Of course, our Christmas business as such still holds that end of the deal up. But you definitely can feel it just about the time school lets
29

 RALPH
MILLER J R . #1
out as far as your tourists are concerned. In fact, we even notice it about a month before where we find more older people traveling, you know. I think they probably want to get away from the hubbub of all the kind traveling. Then we'll also find this same trend, I'm sure, as soon as school starts again, we'll find more older couples traveling.
SG: Have you become involved in any civic affairs, say running for any office?
RM: I got a pretty good taste of that right after I come out of the service and after I first went into business. I was on the city council. After I served my term and all, I didn't hardly feel it was too good a mix. I mean it's awfully hard to run a business and at the same time be a city councilman because you have some decisions to make that no matter which way you make them, it hurts you considerably. I can think of one in particular that I got crossed up in, and that was on water rates. We doubled the water rates for those people outside of the city limits that was on the city water system, our feeling and thinking being at the time that water was real critical.
We was going to have to float a bond issue to get a new system put in. At the same time, these people, of course, weren't paying for the police and fire protection, and we felt that the increase was in order. We lost several good
30

 RALPH MILLER JR. #1
customers on that because, you know, you have to take a stand some place. Since that time, of course, I've been on the fire department here for years. In fact, I'm assistant fire chief and have been for the past twenty- four years. I've always tried to work on this type of community affairs. I mean it's a nonpay job, strictly civie. I think I've been mixed up in most all of the civic activities as such, and as far as the organization work with the Elks, the American Legion, Mason's, Shriners, and various organizations of this type. But as far as running for political office, I haven't. My father has been on the county commission for the past ten or twelve years, and I kind of felt that one politician in
the family was enough.
SG: This term on the city council, was this before the
uranium boom, or right when the boom first started?
RM: Oh, it was right about when it first started. It was right when we started having growing pains and problems with our ordinances, such as the outdoor toilets and the moving in of trailers and how close you could put one next to a house, and all this kind of stuff. It was right when the boom first started and when we started having
our growing pains.
SG: What kind of conflicts were there on the council over the
problems of trailers?
31

 RALPH MILLER J R . #1
RM: Well, at that particular time, really not too many. Like
I say, everybody was anxious to have business and this type of thing. I don't think we had too many problems at that particular- time. It was later, after things started slowing down to normal, when, I think, you might say, people started to get a breathing spell and things started leveling off that they started wanting to upgrade the community when the problems came. They had to put in some new restrictions and ordinances. But at that time, we never had any ordinances that I can recall that had too many restrictions.
SG: So it wasn't until the boom was really quieting down?
RM: This is true. When it was pretty much over with.
SG: Were you on the council at all when the problems with the
sewage came up, or was this also after you had left?
RM: Well, the sewage problem wasn't a big problem to us at that time. Like I say, water as such for housing and everything was our problem then. We did go ahead and float a bond issue at that time, which passed, and were even bringing in the experts and getting the projection
figures as to the type of system and the size system we would need and all. As I recall, it was just about eight years later that they had to go ahead and float another bond issue to expand the system again, and at that same time expand the sewage system and all. I don't recall too
32

 RALPH
SG:
RM:
SG:
RM:
MILLER J R . #1
many sewage problems that we had at that particular t i me. I understand there was also quite a dispute over garbage pickup?
Yeah. But here again, this came a little big later. I think this has mostly been the last six, seven years, really, probably more recently, I mean, within the last year actually.
So the main conflict you had when you were in was strictly the water one then?
Yes. At that time, if anybody brought their garbage up to the garbage pit, there were no restrictions on that, no restrictions on burning like we have now because of the air pollution. Water was about the only thing we really had problems with at the time. There's always problems. I don't mean to say there wasn't. It was that and police work. With the many, many people, as you can imagine, moving in, transient people, it seems like this is where we spent about 90 percent of our time and pains, either
with the water department or the police department trying to keep thing smoothed out, getting extra help and deputies and various things along this line.
SG: What were some of the problems the police had?
RM: Oh, about the same as they have today, really. I mean, knockdown, dragout street fights, just a little bit of
everything.
33

 RALPH MILLER JR. #1
JD: Do you think that one of the reasons for this is that the
RM:
miners kind of played maybe a little bit harder than most of the other people?
Yeah, they played pretty hard. This no doubt had a lot to do with it. It seemed like there was always a lot of family problems then, man and wife problems, so to speak. No doubt a lot of this was caused from the bars and drinking.
Did a lot of the miners spend a lot of money on non-food items such as tobacco and alcohol? Did you notice that they were any different than anyone else?
Oh, I don't know. I guess you always think they always buy a little bit more than anybody else on this kind of stuff, but I don't know as they really were a lot different.
After a lot of the people moved out of the area, those people who had just come for the boom, and you went back to giving credit to the miners, were they pretty much the way they were before? Were they still paying most of their bills?
JD:
RM:
JD:
RM: Well, about the same percentage as the rest of them. I don't know just exactly how to answer that question. But I mean, as far as those people we had carried on credit that ran mines and all at the time, we maybe continued on
with their credit business even though they didn't
34

 RALPH MILLER J R . #1
continue to operate the mines and all. Their paying habits has still been good.
SG: How did you determine, for a miner, where you stopped giving him credit? How did you decide, or was this just a personal thing?
RM: Well, it was mostly personal and off the top of your hat. In some instances we were able to work with the mining people themselves by authorizing, say, fifty to a hundred dollars worth of credit to Joe Blow, we'll say, and then when that limit was reached, we cut him off. I mean, we didn't go any further. But the companies themselves in many cases would guarantee the account. Then, if they terminated the employment of the people, they would call us and tell us that "this man has been fired, and we want to know what his account is, so we can hold it out of his check." This is the only way that we would usually go ahead and operate with credit. There's always some circumstances when you deviate naturally. A guy comes in and he's broke and he's just moved in and he needs a grubstake or something like this, why we'd stick our neck out periodically and say, "Well, we'll let you have ten, fifteen, twenty-five dollars worth of credit until you get your first check." This is the places where we got
hurt. Or they'd go ahead and bring in that first paycheck and pay you that twenty-five. Then the next week, or the
35

 RALPH
MILLER J R . #1
next time, why, it was a little longer between pay periods, and something happens, so the grocery bill could be fifty dollars next time, and he'll pay that. Then the next time maybe it went to seventy-five, and then you didn't see him no more. Or, you know, he'd pay you fifty and say, "Well, charge this balance. I'm going to carry this other twenty-five over and pick it up next time." Maybe they did, and maybe they didn't. This is where it usually gets away from them.
SG: Turning back to police problems, was there any problem with juvenile delinquency at that time? Or with alcoholism?
RM: Oh, I would say some, yes. I think there always has and always will be, as long as I can remember.
SG: What went on before the uranium boom? Did these things increase then?
RM: I don't think so. You're talking strictly as far as teen- agers are concerned at that particular time?
SG: Yeah, juvenile delinquency or just the overall problem with alcoholism regardless of age.
RM: No, I don't think so really. Like I say, there's probably some of those things that stand out a little more in some people's mind because brawls just break out on the sidewalk or something like this. But if anything, I'd say
probably as far as the teenagers are concerned at that
36

 RALPH
MILLER J R . #1
particular time, there might even have been less of it. It seems like that these kids was pretty much all working. Everybody had a job, and they was pretty well occupied this way. In fact, I don't think it was as bad as it is today, to be right honest with you. But there always has been those problems and there always will be those problems, I'm sure of this.
JD: Do you know what reasons City Market had for coming in at this time, since the uranium boom was already over and the potash thing was already beginning to fall again?
RM: Well, I think the City Market felt, which I'm sure is true, that they had a lot of people, like I had mentioned to you before, that had probably gone to Grand Junction shopping because of numerous reasons. No doubt a lot of people had commented to them that they sure wish they were in Moab or something of this nature. They no doubt surveyed the area pretty good and figured that there was room enough for another market in the area. I think that the time factor was wrong as far as they were concerned. I've been told this. It was wrong as far as I was concerned, to be right honest with you. I think that just
about the time that they did move in, business actually
started to fall to some extent.
SG: Yeah, so I was wondering--
RM: I think it's been real tough. They've stated many time
37

 RALPH
MILLER JR . #1
their timing was completely wrong on the thing, that it should have been sooner. Or, they felt that they should have waited. It naturally made it a little bit tough. I mean, when you start on a big expansion program, I think this is always the bad thing about these things, so to speak. You get keyed up and know that you've got to expand, and then when you do expand and are building for a certain sized community and all and you have cutback on it, why, it actually makes it pretty tough to cope with.
SG: Do you remember what the effect on your business was when City Market first opened?
RM: Percentage-wise?
SG: Yeah, or any other kind of indicator you can give.
RM: Oh, golly, here again that's awfully hard to say. Can't
remember just what all was taking place at that particular time as far as the potash industry and what have you. You always have your big slump, you might say, when they first open, naturally, from curiosity and grand opening ads and all this kind of thing. It would probably amount to around 40 percent to begin with. Then it seemed to come back, and percentage-wise from that point on, it's like I say, it's just awfully hard to say because you never know what was taking place within the area at that particular time and all. It wasn't too far after that that we started construction on our railroad out
38

 RALPH MILLER JR. #1
here going down into Potash. The road was being built down into Potash, the shaft being sunk, and this type of
thing. So really, we picked up to about where we were
before.
SG: Is there enough business at the present time to support
two large markets? Well, actually you have two of your
own, but those plus City Market?
RM: Well, let's put it this way. For the amount of investment
that you have in an operation of this type--I'm talking about what you've got wrapped up in your equipment, your building, your inventory--no, it doesn't justify it, not nearly. In fact, I'd like to have what I've got wrapped up in that and have the money to do something else with, to be right honest with you. There certainly must be an easier way to make a living. The hours you have to keep and the staff it takes to run one of them and the problems that you have, just don't begin to warrant it when you figure your return on your investment.
SG: Do you view this as being more of a temporary thing?
RM: I think so. I don't think we're going to see a fast change. I definitely feel it's temporary. I mean, if I didn't, why, I'd sure be doing some different shuffling
than what I'm doing right now. I feel that as soon as Potash goes ahead here now, which I think they definitely are, with their solution mining, at least people right
39

 RALPH MILLER JR. #1
now pretty well know what's going to happen. I think it's the uncertainty sometimes that really makes it bad psychologically as far as people are concerned. The psychological effect, I think, is the worst thing that can happen. The people tighten up with their buying and all this type of thing. But I think as soon as they start on the solution mining and the construction of this, as well as the big development that's going on in the Lisbon Valley, and they start mining down there and all, I think we'll see this thing come back. I really do. And with tourism like it is and with the Canyonlands getting the publicity that it is, I don't think it can miss.
SG: Has Miller's thought about moving beyond Moab, moving out into other areas, other communities?
RM: We moved out, like I mentioned to you a minute ago, with the packing house, and then we also acquired a store in Grand Junction, Colorado, but that was just sold here in
May of this year. When this store was sold, why, we was also in the process of acquiring this other one here in Moab. There's some problems, unless you're a lot bigger than we are, to try to operate this far away. Personnel is the big problem, trying to find the right management. Then, too, you take that area--we had, for instance, just three blocks from us where Albertson's is moving in with a big shopping center and 0. P. Skaggs. Then right down
40

 RALPH MILLER JR. #1
the street from us, just five blocks away on North Avenue, one of the main thoroughfares, Safeway bought out all the firms, took down some motels, a gas station, and a few things, and they're putting in a big complex there. We got a chance to sell out, so we sold out. But as far as expansion as such, there may be a day when we will go ahead and expand further on out, but we don't have any plans right at the present.
H a s t h e s i z e o f y o u r o u t 1 e t s c a u s e d y o u a n y capitalization problems?
RM: It always does when you start into this kind of program, in financing a program for the size of the building and all. It's always a problem, but fortunately we've always been able to find the necessary financing and haven't been disappointed this way. Naturally, like I say, there's always a lot of red tape that goes into this, as you can probably well appreciate. By that I mean tight money, high interest, and everything else.
SG: I was wondering whether, during the uranium boom or since, you've wanted to move into certain areas and have been stopped because of lack of capital?
RM: Well, yeah. We did have quite a tough battle when we moved to the shopping center out here, as an example. When we started in asking for financing, the first thing
we got from our loaning institution was that they felt it 41
SG :

 RALPH
MILLER J R . #1
was too far out and that we had two natural barriers. We had Mill Creek and we had Pack Creek. Even though they had bridges across, they seemed to feel that this would
be a barrier. So they turned us down, as far as our financing was concerned. They just felt it was a bad move. So we then had to go the association who was buying our merchandise from and who had an engineering service. They had drawn all our plans and done all the projections and all this kind of stuff, knowing, I think, what happens in the industry that some of the other places had to move out. They went with us a hundred percent. They put up the biggest part of the money and then handled financing for it.
SG: But did that delay it?
RM: It did delay it, yes.
SG: What do you see now as the future of Moab?
RM: Oh, I think it's a combination of things actually. Just
like I mentioned, I think solution mining as far as the potash is going to be here to stay. There's always, it seems like, quite a big of activity in our oil industry, drilling. Uranium certainly seems to be coming back. Vanadium certainly has had a price increase here that seems to put a different outlook on that. I'm sure that Atlas is probably going to go ahead with another mill down here for processing that. I think that we're going
42

  RALPH MILLER JR. #1
to find a lot of our smaller miners working some of these smaller mines. I can think of one in particular out here at the Seven Mile area now who has really located some good ore and I think is going to have another rich strike on it. So I think that and our Canyonlands area going the way it is through tourism and all, I can't see how it can possibly miss.
So the future of Moab right now looks fairly solid?
SG: RM: SG:
RM: SG: RM:
I would say so.
Is there anything else we haven't covered up to now that you think we should add, in terms of your own store or in terms of the town itself?
No, not really. I sure can't think of anything.
Okay, thank you very much sir.
Y ou're sure welcome.
