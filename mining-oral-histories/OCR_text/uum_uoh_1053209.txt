 T H I S I S AN INTERVIEW FOR THE URANIUM INDUSTRY ORAL HISTORY
LM: When I am collect at a---?--- with different people from all over the country, quite interesting situation like that, and draw people in different parts of the country, internationalities and down there without hardly any shade or accommodation of any kind; no air conditioner, no electricity, so we needed a job pretty bad so that's why we were there, but we gladly went. Wouldn't have missed it for nothing.
SS: And did you work at the Happy Jack or which mine did you work down in.
LM: No. We both worked at the mill.
SS: At the mill huh. That's what I thought.
LM: We were closely acquainted with the men that worked at
the mine and understood how the mine got there. You probably heard the story that was told. Somebody sold the hole in the ground for a thousand dollars--was really ?---. He wasn't very long before he was really sad about it. They had to try to ship the ore that came out with a thousand dollars. They shipped a load into Salt Lake and
assayed it. And they couldn't buy it because it had too much uranium in it. And so the government got hold of it and found out it was one of the first good uranium deposits that they found in the country other than the

Temple Mine. That's a picture of the ferry down there. The mill is on this side. They always have---?---.
Did they ever use that ferry for--they never did try to ship ore out that way did they over toward Hanksville? No. There was acid came in this way.
Yeah. There was acid and the snowdash came across from the ferry all the time. They have to take the truck across one trip and then the trailer the other trip. But they brought trailers down there, somewhere down there. But they use to--is that thing running it?
Yeah. That's what drives it. You can't see it. You see this steamer?
No.
It goes through here and it wraps around the rear wheel of this little Model A, and then it comes around the other side. It was a good dependable reliable ferry. Well, I guess those Model A's has done a lot of things. We kind of frowned on the price of it a little bit.
Oh, really. [laughter]
It caused us to go in the airplane business.
How much or how did he charge?
He charged five dollars for a car I think.
Well, it got to be seven for car and drivers, and then it was how much?
Fifty cents the first one.
Fifty cents the first and a dollar extra if you had a cat

or dog and if you had duel wheels--if you had a small pick up with duel wheels--that cost you. Of course he had to make a living and wouldn't make any difference. There was somebody came in there with horses. It's really hard on your pocketbook.
Yeah, I imagine if you went across there very often. Well, what year did you all go down here?
Can you remember? I think it was close to '51 or 1 52. We went in August, '52 and we left in June or July of
1 53.
So you left your family down there for a year?
Nearly a year.
I'd wonder if you'd allow me to take this back to school and reproduce that article and I'll mail it back to you. Yeah. There was a story about the ferry years ago and this was when the old man and Lee was running it. The one that was connected with the Mountain Meadow Massacre. He saw some riders corning so he automatically started the ferry up and crossed the river and picked them up. And
they'd been riding pretty hard and the horses was a sweating. Just got them abroad the ferry and he said, "Wait a minute, there's some more riders corning." He said, "I never seen so many six shooters in rny whole life and they were all pointed at rne." And he said he won't
wait for no one. [laughter]
Honey, that was Lee's Ferry, this wasn't the Hite ferry.

LM: I know it was the Hite ferry hon, yes it was. If I'm
wrong I stand to be corrected. So they crossed the river just as quick as they could and left the sheriff and the posse behind. That's who were following them until they just kept the ferry on that side of the river and thumbed their nose at them the rest of the night. And the next day they took Mr. Lee, and took him a good day's trip back out in the desert with no shoes or boots. And they went on the way. That gave him--he couldn't get to any help for a full day. That gave him two to three days head start. And left three days head start actually because in them days it'd take a day or two to arrive for any help even after he got back to the next ranch. And I thought
it was kind of a funny story.
SS: Yes, that's interesting.
LM: Pass it on.
SS: Then you and your father went down to-- DM: It was about April in 1951.
SS: And let's see, that mill had just been operating about a year wasn't it?
DM: No. I think it was longer then that.
LM: I think it came earlier then that. We were living in
Price and the people that I was learning to fly from was flying beer in there to the guys. Once a week they'd take a load of beer, all they could haul in. Transportation was terrible out there and it was a good five hours to
4

 DAN AND LEON MARSING #1
decent road from there. And we didn't even have a air conditioner, then you'd blow a tire on the truck. The time you get out there you would be filthy and dirty whether you'd like it or not.
DM:
I thought that that mill went in '48 or '49, but they say
started.
LM: It was quite secretive when that mill went in. The
government really didn't want everybody to know it was there because the uranium was so scarce. Well, they just didn't know how much they was gonna be able to get you know, until they hit the Big Indian strike why they didn't know whether they had enough uranium to make a stand with anybody or not. It was kept quite a secret. We was heavily instructed to keep our mouth a little quiet at that time. Because now it's well known to anybody-- even to look it over.
SS: Well, do you know why VCA ever decided to put that mill there, I mean it's kind of a---?---.
LM: The government had asked them to. Now can't see. I don't know if they make very much money or not because we was only processing thirty tons a day and it takes a lot of
hard work to process that.
ss: And how was the process scheduled? Did you get good
recovery?
LM: Well, no we didn't get a good recovery. And the mill was
kind of old and obsolete even then. I couldn't knob the 5

 DAN AND LEON MARSING #1
yellow cake regardless to that wasn't very good either will over and right over the river. It was something I thought we ought to have fixed. It seemed like we never did.
ss: Well, did they think that the Happy Jack would have enough ore to--is that why they put that ore to--is that why they put that a--
DM: You bet. That is one of the main reason that mill was there because the Happy Jack was one of the very first producers of commercial ore. Durango was going. I don't think that the VCA had any agreement with the government on that putting the mill there. The government thought of the uranium and they made an agreement with Bronson and Cooper.
LM: Nevertheless the government helped get VCA to put it here. Nevertheless when there's money involved it's not to hard to get somebody to do something and there was going to be some money involved. They made a million dollars in the first year, Bronson and Cooper did. And they mined out several million and then they sold it for fifteen million--
ss: And do you have any pictures of them?
DM: Even after it has been open-pitted then thought they got
it all the--
LM: Then Atlas wound up with it, Atlas Minerals. And they put
a couple of boys down there from Blanding that thought
6

 DAN
AND LEON MARSING # 1
could pour a little ore out for them and they run into mint and they made a half of a million apiece just contracting. So I know that Atlas has come out with two or three of the deal. They don't deal unless they got a chance to make double or triple of what the miners would make.
This is why I wondered about the VCA even deciding to put that mill down there because as a rule the company likes to control the mine before they will put it in operation
SS:
in the area.
LM: Well, I think it was a lot of uncertainty about it and
another thing that took place there that I thought was kind of funny. They hand-mucked all the muck that was, every day, thirty tons of muck they hand-mucked to a small car and took it down the mill in a small truck. And the mine could have produced way more tonnage then that.
SS: How about the mill, could it handle more?
LM: No. It was about capacity for the mill. We could have pushed a little more through but that was about average so it was thirty tons a day. If don't think we could up it to forty, getting done with it. Then you crowded. We
working three shifts around the clock seven days a week. ss: How many men to shift?
XX: Don't ask me, I didn't work there.
DM: There was about four.
SS: Four!
7

 DAN AND LEON MARSING #1
LM: Yeah, that would be about right. Maybe day shift would go
down to six or seven for mechanic. Operator and
precipitation operator--what did they call them muckers? LM: Yeah. They use to pull in the presses, you been on press to canvas to catch the mud, then they put the mud back in the tank and ship it back up with the uranium mine. They
had to get---?---
ss: Why don't you start and tell me because I don't know.
Okay, you got ore coming from the mill. What did you do
with it, what did they do with it there?
LM: It had to be crushed the first thing, then you get all
the ore in the mine. Crushed and run through a ball mill if you're aware of a ball mill. This is just a bunch of real heavy rods that are inside of a barrel--the ore almost to flour and then it would go on to acid leach-- into a heavy acid water and settle it out and take the water off and this would pick up the uranium in the acid leach. And then eliminate some of that sand and then it goes into a boiling process, and we break it, we break it back to a soda solution then after it came out of that acid, boiled it and put it through this press with canvas and when the presses were full, which sometimes it wouldn't be completely full because of slime and certain things. This would be a problem and we would have to go down and clean and tear the presses down, put back real right, screw type press with a whole bunch of, like a
d

 DAN AND LEON MARSING # 1
honeycomb. or like you'd catch honey. And you drop this out on a cement floor and it would have to be hand shoveled into a wheelbarrow, look outside. And they put clean canvas on. Cinch the press up; turn the water back
on, catch another load. Then the water would still be holding the uranium and it would go back up through the final process to get the uranium out of it, the sand, the mud and the slime would all be gone by then. Then boil it again and pick up the U 308 uranium, would be settled out clear and pretty and worth a lot of money when you come to that.
SS: Um. How did you say you boiled it? That's how you finally get the dry yellow cake?
LM: Yeah. Dan, help me a little bit. Put it in the soda solution with the water it and then this would go down in precipitation. And boil it with steam, boil it inside of wooden tanks.
DM:
LM:
Yeah. It is already one hundred twenty in the shade down there. Then boil it in the tank and make it nice. For fun we'd have water fights once in a while. Wash the place down.
After you boil it a while, then you start lowering the pH and bring it down to neutral. I would be about 1.5 acid from the acid side then we'd add soda ash and the last part, of caustic which is real strong base. And this then would precipitate it out. It would first come in a real
9

 DAN AND LEON MARSING # 1
pretty green color would be carrying copper and iron and vanadium, quite a few other minerals that would have to be separated, the uranium from these minerals, and we'd take pH just long enough so that the iron and the copper and these minerals would drop off, precipitate out. The pH was still high enough to hold the uranium precipitation. And you put these presses the owner is talking about, and the presses with the liquid going through these canvasses would hold back all the iron, copper, ---?--- Uranium would go on throughout some
spigot and up into some other tanks. And then bring the pH on down to neutral which would be seven pH. Then this is going to uranium press for more.
SS: Quite a complicated process.
DM: It was quite complicated. They had a metallurgist from
California. There was quite a few came in there that was with Atomic Energy Commission, mostly to learn the process. See if they could improve it and try to find cheaper better method of extracting the ore. But this was quite costly and I think this is the reason VCA finally pulled out because they couldn't get possession of the mine and they didn't want to pay the price that Bronson and Cooper wanted for the mine. Because it was so costly- SS: It's been a lot of ore come out of that country.
Seems too bad that the mill wasn't more successful.
They shipped it so far and so much of it. What did 10

 DAN AND LEON MARSING #1
you think of the equipment that VCA gave you to work with?
DM: Poverty-stricken. [laughter]
LM: I think that would describe it. In some ways they were
pretty good people, but they sure didn't try to help us very much. They told us that we could have a job but we had to bring what we needed and that was about all they furnished was employment and iots of bedding wire and makeshift. Most everything had to be made by hand, a lot of the two-way valves and other valves was just made with a clamp--clamp over the holes, lay on ground and pinch it down on the holes and fasten it. And when you want to let the water run why--and the mill was built on the steep side. The ore would start at the top of the hill where the process finally wind up at the bottom of the hill. The only place they had any electricity at all was right at the store and they had a boardinghouse and a place where you can take showers, a few things like this.
SS: Did you have a cook shack?
DM:
LM: SS:
Yeah, for anybody that was single or wanted to eat at the boardinghouse. But the families that were married and things like that will not to hard---?---
I believe I've got pictures I will mail to you.
If you would let me reproduce them I'd sure love to. That
would be great. We drove down to Baby Rocks and
interviewed Mr. and Mrs. Free who had a store down there. 11

 DAN AND LEON MARSING #1
Yeah, and they had pictures of the store itself. But that
was all.
DM: The trading post?
SS: Yeah, the trading post.
DM: Yeah, I've got pictures of that.
LM: Well, they were the only one had any air conditioning.
SS:
LM: XX: SS: LM:
XX:
People just congregated there and stay there because it was nice to stay.
What about the camp itself? Could you take trailers in there---?--- and did you live in?
Well, they weren't too bad, no they weren't.
Really.
Let's hear the woman's point of view on that house. Well, we didn't want to invest too much in it because we knew it was a temporary and we, by the time trees growing and things like that, we might---?--- to where they could start making some shade.
And we lived right down by the riverbank right next to willows and we had a little two room house. In the summer the kids would sleep out under the willows and in the winter we would all crowd up together, but it really
wasn't bad. When we look back on it now, it was a kind of a year's vacation [laughter] because we really enjoyed it. Camp was so close everybody had to depend on everybody else.
SS: And did you all get along pretty good? 12

 DAN XX:

XX: XX: SS: DM:
AND LEON MARSING # 1
Oh yes, very good. I think we had recreation, a dance or something nearly every week. Or we'd have a cookout, cookout suppers and usually everybody would participate. Well, down at White Canyon, were there any bachelors and miners without families?
There were quite a few.
There were probably about a dozen.
There are quite a few of them, bachelors.
About how many families were living there when you were
there? How many?
Probably ten families.
And did they have a school going there? How many kids did you have?
I substituted one week.
We had sixteen.
Sixteen, oh that's---?---
We had the LDS church folks in there pretty well. We had branch president and a one room church, and we had the primary, and the relief society, all the month of the
well. People were real cooperative. One of them would go out, why they'd tell everybody they were going out. They'd pick up and bring back stuff for the others and that helped. Help them to be better friends and everything else. And we had an airplane. We tried to make the airplane available whenever anybody was hurt or seriously sick why we'd take them out. I had one
13

 DAN AND LEON MARSING # 1
experience that I might want to share with you. I thought it was kind of coincidental but it would up being quite you might call it a heroic trip. The airplane that I had was only a small Taylor Class with a sixty-five horse engine and it had no clearance lights, no inside lights, no generator for power. But it was real dependable to start and in good mechanical shape. But the Brown family came up. I have made it well-known to everybody in the camp that if anybody needed to go out why I would go out. I'd drop whatever I was doing and go. And they knew that but they came this one day and late in the evening, the shadows was really getting long and said that his wife and two children had pneumonia and they had to go to the doctor. And I inquired around a little bit and I found out that they have been sick all day and I didn't know about it. They came late in the evening and I knew that was dangerous for me to go that late in the day. But because of the urgency of the situation I thought if I'd take a flashlight I could make it to Price--and down there it's also not too wise to well, in the summer, but this wasn't no room. We very seldom had any snow down there. But I got the plane in the air and just got out of
the top of the canyon and it got dark on me. And we flew from there to be at least an hour in total darkness and the children making a fuss because they couldn't see one hand in front of the other. You couldn't even see your
14

 DAN AND LEON MARSING # 1
finger if you hold it in front of your nose. And I turned the flashlight one one~ in a while to see if I had oil pressure. The RPM was running which, course, you can tell quite a bit from sound when you're used to the airplane. And I knew the country real well. I knew where a certain town was and see the great distance from there. I knew we was in a storm. But we got up to Price and the lights were out and had lights, and there was only one light at the airport. I didn't know whether that meant there was anybody home. And that's a one-way you know. I couldn't make it on in to Salt Lake and go back to anywhere else. I had to buzz the field for quite a while and finally the lights come on. And we, you know, the picture of Mark Chatwin's branch. And got in the landing pattern and making a beautiful approach and I turned the flashlight on, indicated about a hundred miles an hour at this point. And to my surprise the lights went out, as far as I was concerned--tell you the rest of the story but I
want to make it a little bit interesting if I can. But I thought he had turned the lights out or it had electrical failure or what. And I thought what do I do now, and the plane was still traveling a hundred mile an hour, and I just touched the ground. I didn't dare lift it up and go around again. I knew there was snow on the ground and high snow banks. Finally it dawned on me that what I had
done was when I landed was got down under the snow banks, 15

 DAN AND LEON MARSING # 1
the lights were out beyond the over top of the snow. If I would have known this I wouldn't have the courage to done what I did, see. But I was a victim of circumstances and a flash come to me just as clear as anything--don't do anything because you know your lined up with the runway, when you've made the final touchdown. This plane would tail wiggle to and bad, easier to fish tail---?--- So we did just do nothing for a second or two and then I seen a snow bank coming up on one side and I didn't know how fast I was going but I hit a rudder and changed the direction of the plane to keep from hitting that one and I just, as soon as I done that I almost hit right into the other side. But wonderful thing we had lost the speed we had. We taxied on in then by a flashlight and right away the airport manager informed me that I was breaking the rules. I wasn't going by the civil air regulations which I already knew. But after he found out what the situation was why he said that, "He's got more guts ---?- --." People got word around that I had landed up there in total darkness and that made me quite a hero, but I
wouldn't want to do it again for a million dollars I'll tell you that. They called me after they got well, and we got almost in the same circumstances going back and we definitely didn't have any lights going back and I went back to catch my tax the next day and I landed just cleared the fence six inches from the edge---?---. Well,
16

 DAN AND LEON MARSING #1
I never give up when I'm trying to help people and--
SS: Do you still fly?
LM: I still fly. Not near as much. I haven't flew for the
last five or six years. I still hold a license and I'm sure can still fly. Done a lot of bush piloting in this area. And I flew in Civil Air Patrol in Grants working in uranium mines down there. Still love to fly and encourage about a ---?--- I still thinks its the best way to travel.
SS: Well, I am beginning to think that everybody believes the only way to go in White Canyon is to fly.
DM: Have you been down there yet?
SS: Y eah.
LM: Even yet it's still one of the best ways to go.
SS: I can believe it. I drove my car in there.
DM: We had to get a boat and go around there where the mill
was from the mine?
SS: I haven't yet. I'm hoping I can do that tomorrow. I got
in the pickup and went down to where the road drops off
into the lake now. DM: Road!
SS: I say road. They told me road.
LM: We had airstrips on both sides of the river, several
close and went out to the Happy Jack and went out to Fry Canyon and real good one to Hanksville, which far as I'm concerned one of the best airports in western states even
17

 DAN AND LEON MARSING # 1
though its got a brand on it surface. So wide and so long you can land a small airplane across if you have to and land safe in comparison with some of the strips we had to land on--
SS: Now, I was what they said was the airstrip by the Happy Jack. Because the widest spot in the road--
LM: And incidentally while we're on the subject of airplanes, we had a strip up the Dirty Devil we thought that was bad, you know. And I took some people in that wanted to look at our property, and I asked them if they wanted me to fly. They said no, that they had some good airplanes and some good pilots. So I just went along for the ride. This one guy talk to me a little bit. I said, "I guess you understand all these bad strips." He said, "Yes. I landed on pretty near all of them in the country." So he brought in one or two people, ferried in. They brought a 18O in the Happy Canyons, that airport was and was ferrying there in there 180, and two in the Super Cub 80 which is one of the best airplanes that money could buy in them days. It had 150 horse engine with flaps on it and real heavy lift wings. ---?---. We was using a 65
horse Taylor craft on these strips. And I know that's the second trip that this one pilot had dropped off and let the other one do the flying. And I asked him, "How come you didn't keep your job up, keep carrying the rest of them in." "That damn trip is a good way to get your name
18

 DAN
AND LEON MARSING # 1
in the paper." Said, "I don't ever want to see that strip again." It was a bad one, there's no fooling about that. You had to be just right. Just barely get touched down right on top of the ridge and the airport would go out of sight and go over top of the real steep hill. The airplane on the runaway turn, change directions just barely wide enough, stay on it anyway. If you dare to pick your guts from there. Pick you back up, sit you down on a safe place.
Did you have planes out there?
Yeah. I flew that my man should have---?---.
Did you ever use your airplane to do any prospecting via a scintillometer?
Some. I can't remember the company that had this one
instrument that they thought they could detect deep ore with it. I flew them quite a bit. I flew from Northern Mesa most of the time. As a pilot on a mechanic bout. But I flew some for White Canyon Mining Company and they were located on Deer Flat out at---?--- White Canyons and I flew some of these--
I don't know what you'd be interested in, really in these picture. The people or the equipment. Is this picture of me in an airplane? There's a helicopter that they used for surveying down there in this picture.
ss: LM: SS:
LM:
DM:
SS: I thought I--
DM: The first time I'd ever seen a helicopter. 19

 DAN AND LEON MARSING # 1
SS: I wondered why they never used helicopters down there. LM: Who is this down by the airplane?
DM: That is only way they can survey that country.
LM: There's a picture of that little red airplane we had. Of
course Bill Wells flying bishop from Hanksville has a lot
of good stories too.
SS: Yeah. I had his name.
LM: And he worked at the mill too.
SS: Oh, did he?
LM: Uh huh. As far as I'm concerned he's one of the best
pilots in the western states and he helped me learn a whole lot. If I hadn't have I may not have been alive today. He's good and he's not foolish. When we encountered storms or anything, we just had to stop. Let it rain. When it got done raining then when it dried up enough that we'd take off, we'd take off. Either that or run away from it or not go at all is which is the best thing to do. Not go at all if the weather was bad. Sometimes you got crowded in the situation that wasn't favorable.
XX: We'd go out about every six weeks. Somebody would bring in most of our supplies but we'd mail some bread and stuff--
LM: I just wondered, Mama Graves probably didn't tell you that but every--now, there are a few things there I didn't feel I could ask--
20

 DAN AND LEON MARSING #1
XX: Well, that's right. I know, I know, I'm not running you
down or anything but we had to survive too.
XX: But some of the people got fed up with it and they
decided that they start there own store.
DM: They did start it.
XX: It just did--
OM: What they call it cooperative store.
XX: Cooperative.
XX: Five dollars a piece to get into or it or something and
then they'd buy everything they could to wholesale then
holds up some---?---
LM: The wages wasn't very terrific down there. I think $1.80
an hour and a far away it was quite--you had to watch
pretty close.
XX: But it was real fun every six weeks on a long change to
go out from town, go to a show and get your groceries, do
your shopping, it was great.
SS: How did they work the shifts? How many days were you on
and then off? LM: Seven days.
DM: We were working the six day shift schedule, I don't just remember how they rotated it, but we would actually get one day time and a half a week.
LM: Oh, a week.
DM: Uh huh. Then not quite sure about that day. LM: Now that day--
21

 DAN DM: ss: LM:
DM: LM:
AND LEON MARSING # 1
Saturday we couldn't have stayed I'm sure.
And you mean when did you get time off?
Well, when the long change that would created about two and one-half hours--
Just exactly the same--
Oh, for three days change that's about the only time we'd go out in that long change--of course the airplane. We could go out one and a half hours. I'd park the airplane right at the house and get in it as soon as it would be warmed up. I could take off and be in Price in an hour and a half. I can pay for my gas, the taxi fare to town and eat a small lunch on what it would cost me to cross the river on the ferry. And I'd still been seven hours away from where I wanted to go.
I kind of have a idea how the road was then over to Bears Ears, Bears Ears there--
Well, it was about a flip up. It was the worst, was worse going out of North Fork and through Hanksville. There was no paved roads till you got clear to Green River, the highway just north of Green River. And that desert was
terrible and the ruts was just drive in and out of them around and around. They just built the road wherever they can get it and sand conditions are terrific out there on the desert. Some.kind of sand blow the road full, real easy to get stuck in the sand. That was, the north wash would wash the road away every time a flood would come.
SS:
LM:
22

 DAN

You happen to get half way down the north wash when the flood would come you just have to get on high ground and wait till the flood was over, and after that you had to wait till the bulldozer would come in a day or two to
clear the road. Sometime you could get out but that was an actual situation that everybody was aware of, that if they got stuck in there in late August around there they could be stranded as long as a day and a half.
If you did drive out did you take food and water in case you did?
Ah, you bet. We always carried enough water for drinking purpose.
You didn't go through the Bears Ears did you on the old

OM: Here's a picture of the Bears Ears. And it's not a very
good picture.
SS: That's a good picture of the road though.
DM: Uh huh. It's a good road there. That stretch there
happens to be a real good one.
XX: --we happen to be moving down there his having a electric
storm up there on top of the Bears Ears and we went
across. Man, I never seen so much lightning in my life. ss: Uh huh. You moved in late August.

LM: This flying bishop pulled a little stunt down there one
time and we talked about ever since. He seen a couple of ladies down in the bottom of this north wash and looked like they was having trouble and so he decided to land the airplane down there and help them. And they thought that he was in trouble and she wanted to know why he landed, and he said he landed to help them fix their tire so they could get on their way---?--- it's an extremely dangerous place to land when he comes right down. He was good. He knew he could do it. But he knew, he was that type of person who's willing to help. He would just risk his neck for you. That happened to be a old pretty good stretch of road there. But he knew he could do it. He'd fly out to Hanksville and get us a film so we could have a show. He'd come in and land with car lights or something like that. Not very safe although I thought we
enjoyed that part of our life. We lost a boy down there. We never did find him in the river. And we left when we lost him, couldn't stand to stay there. It wasn't very long after we left the mill closed down.
SS: I've heard stories that there were a pretty rough bunch of fellows that liked to drink a lot that were transient miners that would come in there and be there awhile and out again at least at Fry. Was this the case at White
Canyon too?
LM: Yeah. There were even a few fights down there and we even
24

 DAN AND LEON MARSING # 1
had one lady down there that claimed that she could whip all of the many men in camp.
XX: You probably got her down too ---?--- Lola Brent. SS: No, I don't know her.
DM: In Grants, New Mexico.
LM: She was quite a character.
SS: She didn't have red hair did she.
DM: Nol
SS: Well, I heard the story--
LM: Well, she's changed a lot now. You wouldn't hold her to
it but she was pretty raggedy the and whatnot.
XX: She knocked the nurse up against the wall one day didn't
she and broke her back or something.
LM: And who was it that--a little story--can you help me who
this was at--. They had made a little rumor that one of these guys were going to whip one of the fellows down there and he got wind of it and two of them come over just for a friendly visit. He come out of the house, whipped them both before they realized what was going on. He had his mind made up he was gonna have to do a good job. I can't think of the name of the people who--but
they were quite shocked.
SS: Did they get into many hassles down there?
LM: And you remember that story, who was it involved that
there was some of them done quite a bit of drinking and
there was this guy that went out was going to go to Price - 25

 DAN
AND LEON MARSING # 1
in the night went across the ferry and he went to Hanksville and got some more to drink which would be about eighty miles, it may have been--whatever the distance would--
Wouldn't that be Irish? Wasn't it called Irish?
XX:
LM: I think it was. Nevertheless he got himself some more
booze, him and the other fellow. He proceeded to go on out to Price and they had driven most the night and he pulled up and here's the ferry staring them in the face. Wanted to know how the ferry got there but evidently they got right back on the same and wound back in White Canyon and so the end of the night and late to have a party so they crossed the ferry and come on over to camp and stayed the night. A lot of talking and laughing over that.
SS: You were talking about a nurse. Did the company have to keep a nurse down there?
XX: Uh huh.
DM: I have a picture of her here.
SS: How were the working conditions in the mill? Were their
safe policies pretty good or not hot.
DM: They didn't have safety policy.
LM: Well, they could of---?--- pretty good except for the
sometimes spilled acid on a fellow. They had a gage on
him, showed when it'd be full or even close but of course
you had other jobs to do and turn the acid on and fill 26

 DAN AND LEON MARSING # 1
the tank up and sometimes forget that you were filling acid and look there, and your acid spilled all over the floor and ground and the valves against the tanks. You had to go right up against the tank, in other words your raw acid would get all over you. Several pair of pants still hanging there. Some people make a mistake and that of course we weren't suppose to do these things but we did. We were human. We make a few mistakes. But I quite liked the job. It was--work was fairly--some job seemed like hard work. Some of it was a lot of time just watching there things, but it was extremely hot. I know
it would be one hundred twenty degrees in the shade a
four in the morning. SS: Oh, my gosh.
LM: When you work night shift and no air conditioning, no shade it can be hard to get any sleep. I know once my father told me he had a favorite place where he could sleep under ledge and he told me if I'd go up there and roll my sleeping bags out there and sleep till almost eleven o'clock. And, oh boy, I'll give it a try so I took
my sleeping bag up there. And here I am dreaming that I'm out in the Sahara Desert then just cooking and dying. I said to myself I can't be, I'm under this ledge. Can't be that hot. I finally woke up and I was out in the sun, right out in the sun and it was two o'clock in the
afternoon. Sweat was just running off of me. I grabbed up 27

 DAN
AND LEON MARSING # 1
my sleeping bag and came on down to the house. It's just a little ways. A lot of guys were known to lay right down against the Colorado River and put gunny sacks or a old quilt or something over themselves and sleep till that would get too hot, and then they'd wake up, get a bucket of water and pour it on themselves then try to go back to sleep. It was quite hard to get enough sleep and rest. No electricity for fans and you got so you didn't mind it so much. People just didn't pay any attention to it except that it was hard to get any sleep. They rotated that shift so that we got off at four o'clock in the morning when the sun shift we only had two or three hours that you could get very much rest.
Seems like your--
I could figure out that shift if I---?---. You went to work at four o'clock in the afternoon.
No, he didn't either. He went to work later than that.
Was it three o'clock to eleven o'clock?
He went to work at eight o'clock and worked till four o'clock to noon then he--
It's been about--one of them recreation that I enjoyed down there was we'd go catfishing. Just get in the shade on the ledge somewhere and fishing and none of them ledges is the best places you get of course. There wasn't
any ledges right along the river where we were fishing. We'd get the boat and go up the river and find a good
ss: DM:
XX: DM: XX:

shady spot. And it wasn't to hard to catch seventy-five to one hundred fishes a day. Catfish would be good channel cats. I like them just as good as trout. Maybe better because the bones are bigger. And flying airplanes or ride a horse, or go boating is about all we had to do, party.
Did you keep a garden down there.
Uh huh.
Helen raised a good garden. The watermelons I thought was better then anyone in the world. I wished we could have kept it for that but it's just the type of mineral the ground had or something you know. Green River always has grown real good cantaloupes and watermelons but I think White Canyon has these a little bit--
Where you ever in danger from flood water either from the Colorado or coming down White Canyon?
Well, I think the year before we were there the river got real high.
Well, we got some terrific weather down at White Canyon some of the time but I don't think anybody was close enough to it to fall in.
Didn't he--

LM: Oh, in the spring in the year, yeah, when the real high water was on.
SS: Well, as I understand the locations of the little community there, it was kind of on a sandbar wasn't it? I mean it was kind of sound.
XX: Where the trading post and stuff was, yes, but then a good share of the families lived on up the Canyon up the river. We did.
LM: Yeah, we had a spring up there.

down there below us and Blakes and-- DM: Can you figure those out?
XX: Yeah.

Well, you can look at them in full--
That's the Moenkopi.
Moenkopi formation down there in the trees is where some of the houses were. It doesn't show in the film way in

Well, he was in Butte, Montana the last we heard, and is that the mill?
Yes, it's very red.
And that looks like a bar.
No. This is the Hite ranch on the other side of the, Art
Chaplin's ranch.
Would you put that maybe on the back. I think I know what most of these are. And this is Mrs. Cooper--is that Joe Cooper's wife?
Yeah, let's see. No, they're from Cortez.
Is this somebody else's wife.
Yes. She ran the boardinghouse. That's it. This is the cook shack.
She was Noyes wasn't she?
No, Mrs. Cooper--
I'll bet that says that over there.
I don't know if you were there when she run the boarding- -I was living in one of the cabins there VCA, living in their cabin and eating out at the boardinghouse. I think
he could get board for thirty to thirty-five dollars a month.
It wasn't too bad. Oh, we did have a few movies come in once in a while--sit up on benches outside.

DM: Okay. This is Willie the nurse standing in front of the
tree. Myron might have told you something about her. She worked for him in the store some but she was a company nurse. Willie and I can't remember her last name. James Evis will remember he name if you talk to him.
LM: Bill and you, on White Canyon, Utah, and he can try much more better--you cut this one too haven't you after you wrote that?
DM: Yeah. I tried to cut them with 35 millimeter. This is Jacob's chair. I don't know if you noticed it when you were down there.

makes me dizzy. It gets all out of perspective it seems
32

 DAN AND LEON MARSING #1 like.
OM: Go head.
LM: But a few people went off that ledge--
XX: I thought I saw a cat down there.
LM: I was in Grand Junction when they brought a couple of
guys out there, man, they were in terrible shape. They threw them out of there. With holes in their head, they looked terrible shape. It was, especially in the winter it can be dangerous I think. Then a few people refuse to ride in the car when they went down the edge of it. They'll get out and walk. Bill Westwood and then Leslie Oliver, the ones that staked the claim and was in the process trying to sell it or mine it. And I was working for Bill Westwood at the time driving truck hauling ore from the Mi Vida mine at Charlie Steen's, and a conversation--the way he explained it to me that he had contacted the old Texas mining company and got them to buy his claim on the Rattlesnake Ridge over there. He said that all he had was a little pod of yellow cake that appeared at the surface of the ground which in the very early days of uranium that's the only place they found it. They get just maybe a pickup load or small dump truck load that would be pretty good ore but it gets clean. They said I made a deal with him to pay me fifteen hundred dollars if the ore was there and then they had to give me five hundred. First load they hauled and of
33

 DAN AND LEON MARSING # 1
course, I got the haul in case there is something there. And he took a 10 percent royalty--could have kept the whole mine for himself. His partner would have had the whole mine. He said, "Golly, I hate to have to ship that load of ore." He said, "I don't think there's five hundred dollars there." Then wound up paying me the five hundreds dollars. They shipped the ore and dug some more and they shipped another load and within two weeks they had a solid face of solid yellow cake that was eighteen foot tall and I seen it with my own eyes, and they just kept digging in that hole until they moved the whole mountain away. It wasn't very long after that Texas Mining Company sold out to--if I could think of their names there in Grand Junction. They sold that for ten million dollars. Veer Westwood and all were going to just start it out and hand dug themselves at least ten to twenty million dollars.
XX: They open pitted that whole thing didn't they?
LM: Yeah. They started in underground this particular spot.
They just had to cut back in before they could get underground and at that one time there was at least fifteen to eighteen foot you could just scrape it off with a spoon it would been pure yellow cake. And another thing a little out of sorts. They blasted that and the yellow cake all over the mountain. I don't know how much money it would have been in long. They went under the
34

 DAN AND LEON MARSING # 1
ground quite a bit and had quite a time holding the ground because it wasn't solid enough. And it was just a gravel side hill kind of. And in them days it was cheaper, you could get more money out of it if you would
lower the grade. Many times we put bucket after bucket of pure dirt in there some more to lower grade it--was so high and I can't think of the construction company but they did spend a half million dollars to move the overburden off of it. To open pit it and they had it down for six months to a year doing that and they thought they was being very foolish to spend that much money to take overburden off. But I know that Veer Westwood made well over a half of million dollars off of his five percent royalties besides he got 10 percent or ten cents a mile for all the ore which I think he came out pretty good shape at that. But look at the money he lost by being just a little bit greedy trying to pull a wizard on somebody to make the money.
ss: Yeah, I can imagine--
LM: Now if he take offense--but that was the way the story
was told to me and I followed it up pretty close. I know pretty well what was mined out of it, and I wouldn't very long ago---?--- the mine. I think it was finished but after they took the overburden off and everyone else took several millions of dollars out of it and then they went underground after that and mined a lot more. It was quite
35

 DAN AND LEON MARSING # 1
a little Glory Hole itself. I know anybody, any poor boy could have started out with a shovel and shift enough ore in a wheelbarrow, made himself a fortune to get him some powder and machine and all the equipment you may need and that's a big problem starting out in this uranium. There
is so many of them that have ore on their ---?--- property but the expense of getting the machinery and taking the risk of whether the ore would run out raised quite a problem. But he sure had his chance there. I think he's all right--took any hurt goes to show you how- DM: Has anyone in your party interviewed Charlie Steen?
SS: I'm not too sure he's impressed with our project.
DM: Oh, is that right?
SS: I really don't know. I know one of the girls is going to
try to talk to him but they say that he doesn't care much
for the project.
LM: I had a funny experience right there in Monticello. I'm
always sticking my foot in my mouth. We were in Out West Cafe and I was sitting down. I was with Veer Westwood at the time. Haven't been introduced to this guy. He asked me where I was from and I told him we had been in White Canyon. So I proceed to tell him this story about this guy that bought this mine for a thousand dollars---?--- sold the mine for a thousand after I got through telling story---?---. He said my name must be Cooper if I hadn't told the story I'd be right there. We had a good laugh
36

 DAN AND LEON MARSING #1
over it. I guess Wayne Johnson could have bought the Happy Jack for less money then that at one time. There was so far down there. The roads were so terrible and it was only known to have copper. But course find out now that most your uranium's got copper and vanadium--well, a lot of uranium was mined for vanadium and uranium was dumped over the mill with a waste pile.
SS:
LM:
Do you know if they ever remilled the tailings down White Canyon?
Well, they was going to, you know, but I don't know if they ever did or not. I know they was going to just, after they got on down there gonna rerun the tailings they could have made money off of it I'm sure. I don't know if the process was good enough to recover it all.
I understand that VCA did have to haul the tailings out from there because it was still high uranium. There's some men from Hanksville hauled that out again, tailings out. They took out--what was another name for those---?- --?
Oh boy, I can't think of that.
But I think they had those tailings.
Did you all ever go back and see after the water of Lake Powell started coming up? Was just about everything torn
down. I know the mill was dismantled but what about the
DM:
LM: DM: SS:
houses and stuff? Are they under the water or--? LM: Up to Fry Canyon.
37

 DAN AND LEON MARSING #1
DM:
LM:
In fact the water is up to Moenkopi Fork there that you can see. It's pretty high from the bottom.
They say it's ten foot higher this year then its ever been yet. Now, who's the guy that lived up toward White Canyon that said he wasn't going to need to move. He was going to be sitting pretty when the lake got higher his front yard. You wouldn't believe it. The water was coming in on the floor, then he decided he had to move--yeah, where Randy M iller lived.
I can't think of his name. He would be a good one for you to talk to.
Yeah, he would. He stayed there a lot longer than-- Woody Hitchell I believe. Have you ever heard of him?
I heard of him but I don't really know who he was or-- Myron Free might know.
He kept a store there after Myron Free left and kind of thought he could stay in the business there. I guess he's pretty well under water now.
DM:
LM: DM: ss: DM: LM:
SS: Okay. Well, is there anything else you happen to think of--
DM: But the shifts that we worked down there: number one shift was from seven o'clock until three o'clock; number two shift was from three o'clock until eleven o'clock; and from eleven o'clock then until seven o'clock in the
morning again is the third shift. And we worked two weeks of each shift. Between the graveyard shift which would be

the third shift and back to the first shift then they get a long change to four days off. Then we'd go out of White Canyon.
Well, the company was exceptionally good with us by allowing us to trade shifts. We could work for each other.
Oh, and get some extra time off. That helps us a lot. One day we had pretty good deer hunting not too far away in the Bear's Ears.
Mr. Davis went down there with electrician. I think right
after when it first started up and then he was maintenance foreman and then he was under Mr. Leroy Parker who's the superintendent there. He's passed on. Oh.
Uh huh, and chief was under him as assistant mill superintendent--is that quite a ways--
Two or three of those miners have died now too that worked in the Happy Jack from lung cancer and--
Casey lives here in Moab. He was a miner here in the Happy Jack mine.

DM: Which starts way before White Canyon.
XX: Right. Well, the whole project covers this.
LM: Well that's true, but I think White Canyon and Temple
Mountain--Temple Mountain is a little bit earlier then White Canyon, but the Happy Jack mine next to Steen was one of the only good deposits.
DM: They d o n 't come down.
LM: There was a lot more ore found in the Temple after but
they didn't know then if there was very much there because the temple really isn't very big but I don't know--made the statement several times that the government didn't know whether they had enough uranium to mount to anything until Steen found his Mi Vida--by then they knew they had enough to make a---?---.
XX: Well, Pick's mine made a lot of money.
Do you know the name of the--
Well, there could be lots of arguing about that but of-- From France the lady doctor that came over.

I'm sure one of your parties would have got.
Yeah. That's the same see really the I don't know which you said is exactly--how you decided exactly beginning date for west of Blanding and on---?--- Cottonwood area which would afford. White Canyon would be opened very much but that was--
It's a paradox.
A lot of that was mined for vanadium.
Vanadium right. That was vanadium first, but as far as I can tell the Happy Jack was just about the first one out there was Blanding that had mined uranium principle and for bid for mine for copper first. Well, I surely thank you for your information that you've done.
Made a little help.
