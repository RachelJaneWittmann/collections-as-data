THI I AN I TERVIEW WIT WILLI INTERVIEWER I WIN TO P. ERIC 0 . THE LEGACY: AN ORAL HI TORY OF UT TAPE NO. 46.
WIN: This is an interview with William Johnson in Bountiful Utah. Today is Jun 27, 2000. This is part of the Saving the Legacy Project and I am Winston Erickson. Do you go by Bill?
BIL: Yes.
WIN: Bill, where and when were you born?
BIL: September 13, 1919 in Sunnyside, Utah, in Carbon County.
WIN: You were born down there in the coal-mining district?
BIL: My family were coal miners, all of my brothers and my father.
WIN: Who were your parents?
BIL: Steven and Emma Ward Johnson.
WIN: Had they been in the coal-mining region for a long time?
BIL: Yes, my mother's family was converted in England to the LDS Church, and my
father's family were converts to the Icelandic area. They immigrated to Utah in 1879. WIN: Your father's parents were from Iceland. How did you end up with a name Johnson?
BIL: In Iceland, they take the father's name and add the son to it.
WIN: So the Johnson.
BIL: Actually, my father was an adopted child, and he came to the United States
with his adoptive parents.

WIN: And they anglicized Jonson to Johnson. BIL: They homesteaded a little farm in Cleveland in m ry ounty. t th tim they came over that was one of the opportunities that they took advantage of. WIN: Down in Cleveland where the Tuckers lived? BIL: Cleveland was in Emery County about eighteen miles south of Price. WIN: Did you ever live in Cleveland? BIL: Very little. My parents did. When they lived there I worked in the coal mines myself for five years. That is where I was when I was drafted. WIN: Did you know the Tucker family in Cleveland? BIL: You bet. My mother's sister was Florence Tucker. WIN: I worked with Ward Tucker. BIL: Ward is my cousin, first cousin. WIN: Oh, he is? BIL: LeVoy is my first cousin. WIN: I worked with him in Canyonlands National Park. I haven't seen him for a while. BIL: He is in very bad health. I saw him on Decoration Day, and he is not well. WIN: Is he still living in Moab? BIL: No, he lives in Cleveland. He may have been to Moab, I don't know. WIN: Is that Ward V. Tucker or is this one of his brothers?

BIL: No I think that's Ward uck r as far as I kno . I d n't middle initial.

1h h

WIN: It was Ward V. Tucker. He used to go by Voy and then it was Ward wh n I

knew him.

BIL: Oh. He has a farm in Cleveland.

WIN: He had brothers named DeLay and Roy and maybe LeVay I don't know.

Maybe that is the one.

BIL: He had several that are dead, two or three.

WIN: That's interesting. I have never met anybody before who knew the Tuckers

from Cleveland. So you grew up in the coal mining area. You were born in Sunnyside.

Was that after your parents had the homestead in Cleveland?

BIL: Yes. That was after my parents got married. They were married in 1897. Utah

became a state in 1896, but in my history I have a copy of their marriage certificate, and it

shows the territory of Utah.

WIN: I see. So when you were growing up in Sunnyside, I suppose you attended

schools there?

BIL: No. We moved to Salt Lake. I had teenage sisters at the time and there was no

employment in that area, so my parents moved, my mother and the daughters, to Salt

Lake, and me. They became telephone operators in Salt Lake, two of them, and one of

them worked in the old Royal Bakery, my favorite place. I used to go there for cream

WL MJO 0

puffs.

WIN: I see. These were your older sisters who worked th r . What did u p r nt

do? What did your father do?

BIL: He was a coal miner. They called him a shot firer. He did the blasting of the

coal from the face of the coal in the coal mine. He also inspected before the other miners

went in, in the morning.

WIN: I see. At that time they were firing when the regular miners were off duty?

BIL: During the night.

WIN: So he had night duty?

BIL: Yes, he and one partner. I went in with him one night. It scared me to death.

WIN: But then he moved to Salt Lake with your sisters?

BIL: Then I started school in the old elementary school on Twenty-seventh South,

which is still in use.

WIN: What east on Twenty-seventh South?

BIL: Let's see, about Sixteenth East on Twenty-seventh South, Fifteenth or

Sixteenth. I am not sure. It is the old-I have forgotten the name of it. That is where I

started school in 1925.

WIN: It is now a private school, isn't it?

BIL: WIN:

Highland Park Elementary. I think they've changed it and moved it farther east, and that is now a private

5

school called Carden chool. Okay what did your fath r d h n h

lt

BIL: He stayed in the coal mines.

WIN: Oh, he stayed down there?

BIL: Yes. He stayed down there and came in on weekends to visit us. W only liv d

there about five years, I guess, and my sisters in the meantime had met their husband -to-

be and some of them were married. Then in 1928 my grandmother on my father's side

died and left him the little farm that they had in Cleveland. That is when we moved to

Cleveland.

WIN: So you moved back to Cleveland when you·were about nine years old?

BIL: Yes. He still worked in the coal mines. Then we left the farm in Cleveland and

just left it and went to live with him in the coal mines. We lived in Wattis and

Consumers. Consumers is where I was working when I was drafted.

WIN: I see. So you lived in the coal mining towns?

BIL: Yes.

WIN: You shopped at the company store?

BIL: Absolutely.

WIN: Built up your debts to the company?

BIL: Yes. That was a demand from the company that you shopped in their grocery

store.

WIN: In the company grocery store. And you lived in their buildings?

BIL: Yes.
WIN: When did you start working in the mines at what age?
BIL: When I graduated from high school in 1937. I camped on th up rint nd nt'
doorstep until he gave me a job on the tipple. Tipple is where they prepare the coal for shipment. WIN: Separating the different sizes of coal.
BIL: I was picking boney, impurities, out of the coal.
WIN: Sure.
BIL: I worked there for five years. Of course, we had planned to be married, my
wife and I, on the 20th of December-that was before we knew anything would happen to Pearl Harbor. WIN: Let's go back to your time in the coal camps. Where did you go to school when you were living in the coal camps?
BIL: There were elementary schools in all of the coal camps.
WIN: All of the camps had their private schools?
BIL: Yes. They were run by the state.
WIN: Oh, they were not private; they were state schools?
BIL: No, they were state. Then I rode a bus for four years from Wattis to Price to go
to Carbon High School. That's where I graduated. WIN: As you were growing up and going to school, do you remember any teachers or

7

classmates?

BIL: Yes some of them. I had many friends and I lo d th t a h r in high h l.

One in particular taught me typewriting Sara Melaney. At that tim venin 1934 r

193 5 during the four years I went there, she was in her eighties and still teaching typing. WIN: Oh, really?

BIL: I just barely had enough to graduate, if I had one more half-a-credit and she let

me type two or three or more budgets to get the five points, so I was a successful

graduate.

WIN: What subjects interested you when you were going to school?

BIL: The study of rocks, what is it, geology?

WIN: Geology.

BIL: Geology. I have a very humorous thing about that in this history book. That

was really my favorite. I was too little to play football. The uniforms wouldn't fit me.

WIN: So you didn't engage in a lot of athletics?

BIL: I didn't engage in too many athletics. I was athletic, but very small. My friend that drew this, the three of us took the geology class together, and we dug up a dinosaur at

the dinosaur quarry and I think it is still in the college in Price, the College of Eastern

Utah.

WIN: BIL:

Oh, really? Burke Hiatt was his name, me, and Don Naylor. We were buddies. Burke

became a cartoonist for Disney. WIN: Oh he did? BIL: You can see why he would from that. He just penned that in cla on day. WIN: Had some talent, then, didn't he? BIL: Yes, he was, very. WIN: That's interesting. So you liked geology and they taught geology in high school? BIL: Yes. Oh, I liked commercial arithmetic. That was one of my favorites. I didn't like algebra. WIN: I can understand that. BIL: Or geometry. But I had a very good experience in high school. For four years I rode a bus from Wattis to Price. It was hard to participate in any of the activities simply because we didn't have a car. WIN: If you tried to do something after school you had to walk home? BIL: That's right. It was eighteen miles. WIN: That's a long walk, isn't it? So in high school you were in the Depression. BIL: Yes, I was. WIN: How did the coal mines fare during the Depression? BIL: Very poorly. WIN: Your father managed to maintain his job there?

BIL: He did manage to maintain his job but they w r only

r

two days a month.

WIN: A month?

BIL: Yes. I credit my mother for surviving. She was the most wonderful cook in the

world. She could make a meal out of most anything. Have you ever tried fried oatmeal

with syrup?

WIN:
BIL:

Oh, yes, I have tried that. Or molasses? We had that and her bread was wonderful. We lived on bread

and her preserves.

WIN:
BIL:

Did you maintain your farm out at Cleveland at this time? Yes, we did.

WIN: So did that produce some food for you?

BIL: Yes. We always had a garden, a big garden. That helped us survive, too.

WIN: And she put up preserves?

BIL: Yes, everything. She put up the deer that we got each fall.

WIN: From the deer hunt?

BIL: From the deer hunt.

WIN: Did she put them in bottles?

BIL: Yes. Pressure cooker, and vegetables, fruit of all kinds. We survived.

WIN: You had food but you didn't have much else?

BIL: She was a wonderful seamstress my moth r. h mad b auti I dr . n fact, I didn't have a store-bought shirt until I was eighteen years old. But t g t my textbooks in high school, she sewed and made dresses for her friends and n ighbors and she made enough to buy me a nice tweed suit for graduation exercises. So the Depression was a very sad time in our lives. I'm the youngest of eleven children. WIN: Oh, you had ten siblings? BIL: Yes. I had four sisters and six brothers. WIN: Hard to keep track of that many. BIL: I'm the only one left. WIN: I thought I had a lot, and I only have seven siblings with eight in my family. BIL: My father died while I was overseas on October 6, 1944. That was a sad day in my life. WIN: Of course. BIL: He was dead and buried two weeks before I knew it. WIN: Before you knew it. So you graduated from high school and I guess you just planned to work in the mines afterwards? BIL: I would have been a coal miner, yes, had I not been drafted. I worked five years on the tipple and inside the mine some. WIN: So you would have graduated in what year? BIL: I graduated in 1937.

WIN: So you got out in 1937 and you camped on th up rint nd nt' d r t p til he gave you a job at the tipple? BIL: Yes. WIN: Then you picked boney for five years? BIL: No, I didn't stay in Wattis, for only two more years. My brother was an official in the old Blue Blaze Coal Mine in Consumers. He talked me into moving over there for a raise in pay. In Wattis I was making $4.52 for nine hours work. He raised my pay, so I moved over there, and I worked on the tipple there. It was just a small truck mine, loaded trucks. That's where I was when I received my draft notice. WIN: I see. So you had two jobs. One was at Wattis and one was at Consumers with the Blue Blaze Coal Company. BIL: Yes. WIN: Both those companies survived the Depression, but they went way down in production? BIL: They just ceased to exist. Wattis is still in operation. I don't know how big it is, but it loads the unit trains that go to, one place is Fontana, California, the steel company there. They mine coal for electric plants in Carbon and Emery Counties. WIN: Wattis is still in operation, then? BIL: Yes. I think they have done away with everything but a conveyer belt that comes right out of the mine and dumps into a big storage silo.

WI LIAM JOHN ON

WIN: Yes. Coal mining has changed considerably. BIL: Oh, very much so. WIN: No longer go shovel. It's a big long wall mining system now that is basically all automated. BIL: Yes. Long wall loaders that chew the coal down and load it into cars. WIN: Spit it out onto a conveyer belt instead of having all of the little horse driven carts.
BIL: Right, and the mules.
WIN: Mules. And then they went to electrical power, and that's even-now they just do it on a conveyer belt, huh?
BIL: Yes.
WIN: Okay. You got your draft notice and you were engaged to be married. Where did you meet your wife?
BIL: At a dance in Cleveland.
WIN: Oh, really? Was she from Cleveland?
BIL: She was teaching school in Cleveland, elementary school, first or second grade.
I'm not sure which. But we were both dancers. We loved to dance, and we attended about every-that's about the only recreation that we saw in Carbon and Emery counties at the time. There was very little else that you had money to do. They had an old open-air dance pavilion between Castle Dale and Huntington. Wilburg's was the name of it. We went

there every Saturday night and every free holiday night and dane d. o dancing.

did a 1 t

WIN: Wilburg. Does it have something to do with the mine down there?

BIL: Yes, the same family. Same family that runs the mine had the open-air

pavilion. But it's no longer there.

WIN: You always found something to do then?

BIL: Yes, we did.

WIN: You met your wife-to-be. She was teaching school in Cleveland, and you got

engaged?

BIL: Yes.

WIN: Do you remember when that was?

BIL: For over a year we had planned this December 20th date. I don't know why we

set that date, but we did.

WIN: You graduated in 1937 from high school. You had two years before the war

started in Europe. Were you aware of what was happening in Europe? Did you get radio

or newspaper?

BIL: Yes. Radio, mostly. We didn't have the newspaper in the coal mines. There was

no delivery of any newspaper, but we did have radios.

WIN: So the radio reports made you aware?

BIL: We knew what Hitler was doing, and we hated it.

14

W LLI MJO 0

27

WIN: Did you surmise that you would be drawn into it?

BIL: I had a very strong inkling that we would becom embroiled in a orld ar. I

really did. After World War I, I had a brother-in-law in that in the European theat r. I

used to talk to him very much about the conditions, and he was certain that there would

be a terrible war again. WIN: So you were anticipating a war, but you set December 20 as a wedding date. BIL: We were married in her hometown in Emery. That's where her father was a

postmaster. WIN: Oh, at Emery, Utah?

BIL: Emery, Utah. She was going to North Emery High School, and we met at the

dance in Cleveland after she had graduated and was teaching school. Her father was

postmaster for seventeen years in Emery. Like I say, we had become well acquainted at

dances and decided to get married on that date knowing nothing about Pearl Harbor at the

time.

WIN: BIL:

Of course, you couldn't know that. I got a form from the draft board with some very embarrassing questions in it

as to why I got married, and it made me angry. So I just put my name and address on the

top of it and in the remarks column I put, "I didn't get married to avoid the draft." By

return mail I had my call. We were married five months before I went into the army on

May 2, 1942.

WILLIAM JOHN ON

WIN: And you went into the army? BIL: I went into Fort Douglas and was there just a day-and-a-half and th y nt m to Camp Crowder, Missouri, for basic training. At Camp Crowder they gave us a code aptitude test. I would swear they gave you the code characters and you told whether they were alike or different. I had mine done before the record ended, but I must have guessed right, so they sent me to Valparaiso, India~a, to a Dodge Radio and Telegraph Institute. That's where I learned the art of international Morse code and radio maintenance theory. We were there for eight weeks training just in code because I was a radio operator already, though I didn't know it. WIN: This was in Indiana? BIL: Yes, Valparaiso, Indiana. They had an old glass factory on the outskirts of town, and it was closed. We cleaned that up as our barracks. There was 110 of us going to school there. We cleaned that whole glass factory up--the building was good-for our barracks. Then we went to school from there each day. Unfortunately, instead of the 288th Signal Company, they sent our records to the 287th, and they went overseas to Europe. Consequently, our records followed them. We didn't have any pay or rations allowance or anything in Valparaiso. My wife came to visit me there while I was going to school, and we lived on bologna sandwiches. There was a cafe in town that was run by a very wonderful old Greek fellow. You know, he gave credit to all of the 110, or whatever wanted to, in that cafe. We ate breakfast and dinner. He trusted us because he knew that

16

WILLIAM JOHNSON

72

our records had gone and we weren't getting paid for it must ha b WIN: Really?

r nth.

BIL: But he told me later that he had not lost a dime. As soon as we got our pay

everybody went and paid him. I've never forgotten that old fellow.

WIN: Shows that some people have good hearts and had the interest of the country in

mind even at that level. Did your wife continue to teach school while you were in?
BIL: Yes. She taught some of my cousins. VaLoy Tucker and Leon Bowden, they

were my cousins. They talked her into teaching two years of high school in the North

Emery High School while I was overseas. But her preference was first and second grade,

which she taught most of the time for thirty-one years. She followed me while I was

training in the states.

WIN: She would come in the summers when school wasn't in session?

BIL: When school was out she would come and stay with me. We were sent to radar

school. When radar was first invented they sent us to school in Boca Raton, Florida. We

had moved from-1 am getting ahead of the story. We had moved to Cape Cod,

Massachusetts, Camp Edwards.

WIN: After Valparaiso?

BIL: After Valparaiso. That was where I joined my company in the 3rd Amphibious

Engineers it was then, but they changed the name later. Then we stayed there in

maneuvers on the island of Cotuit, and Camp Edwards, and made amphibious landings on

17

WILLIAM JOHN 0

Martha's Vineyard and all of the islands near there. Wh nit cam 11th h·pp ur brigade to Camp Gordon Johnston, Florida. Camp Carab 11 it wa at fir t and th nth y changed it to Camp Gordon Johnston. That's sixty miles south ofTallaha s wh r w were maneuvering still, making mock landings, hauling assault forces ashore on islands and shores. We became very expert at it. After that much training you do get very good at it. Our brigade was somewhat like a pool. We had three boat companies which handled the landing barges: the 533rd, the 543rd, and the 593rd. They furnished the boats for the landings. They took assault forces into all of the landings. Consequently, we had to furnish radio communication and also telephone communication from our company. In addition to the three boat companies, there was a 288th Signal Company and Headquarters Company. Each landing they would draw from our company and Headquarters Company whatever clerks or radio operators and linemen or telephone men, and we furnished communications while the landing was taking place. That's why we were involved in the landing. WIN: That's a very vital part of the landings, isn't it? BIL: Very. We always had two radios in every landing. I never was involved in the first wave. That was the assault forces, of course. But I've been in the second wave, and I've seen the third and fourth waves, which got most of the fire from the enemy. I guess they were hid up until the third or fourth wave hit the beach and they had the beach zeroed in pretty well. That's what took most of the fire.

18

WILLIAM JOHN 0

27

WIN: BIL:

So you went to training in Florida and then Boca Rat n? Boca Raton, and they had moved us to Fort Ord and then ad tachm nt wa

sent to Boca Raton airfield to Radar School. They shipped us back there and radar had

just been invented. Only the air corps, nineteen of us, went to Boca Raton to the training.

It was the air force that we went to for training, and all of the equipment was airborne

and we were on boats. It was a foul up. They hadn't even made any radar equipment that

would go on a boat. I had a radio on the crash boat. I was signalman on the crash boat for

much of my service overseas. All of the radio operators took turns on the crash boat

because that was the wave commander's boat. He designated what waves we were going

in and told them when to go. We did that with the blinker lights. It was radio silence on

all of the landings until the landing was completed.

WIN: So you were in training until you went-you'd been in the army in training for

over a year when you were sent to Fort Ord for this?

BIL: Yes. When we went to Fort Ord, that is where we received final medical

examinations, inoculations, etc.

WIN: Oh. Then you went from Fort Ord back to Boca Raton?

BIL: Yes. This contingent of men went back to radar school, and we were there for

six

weeks '

I

think

it

was '

J·ust

a

little

over

a

month.

Then

they

sent

us

back

to

Fort

Ord

and

the company and the brigade moved out on the transport ships to the South Pacific.

WIN: Okay.

19

WILLIAM JO N ON

BIL: They issued us winter clothing to go to the outh Paci 1c. h t would guess we were going to Alaska or somewhere like that. WIN: Yes. So you went to the South Pacific. Do you remember when you embark d? BIL: Christmas Eve of 1943. We went to Pittsburgh from Fort Ord. Then they took us by ferry down to San Francisco Bay. Then we boarded the USAT U.S. Army Transport, Cape Perpetua. WIN: This was Christmas Eve? BIL: Christmas Eve of 1943. We were thirty-two days on that transport before we landed at Goodenough Island. But three days of that thirty-two we spent dead in the water because the propeller shaft was bent. WIN: Oh, really? They had to repair that? BIL: We were in submarine territory, and it was a complete blackout at night. You couldn't even make a sound on deck at night. But they had to change that shaft, and it took them two days and a night to do it. We just sat dead in the water while they did. That was scary. WIN: Yes, I guess that would have been. When you were going across, what did you do to amuse yourselves? BIL: We had a chaplain aboard that brought a bunch of records, and he played them over the loud speaker. WIN: So you had some music?

20

W LLIAM JOHN 0

BIL: We had music all of the time. Of course th r a th u ual g

ard d

galloping dominos, if you know what that is dice and just conver ation. It a v ry dull

and very long.

WIN:
BIL:

A heck of a way to spend a month, isn't it? It's one terrible way. The landing at Goodenough Island it was a complete

misfortunate mistake.

WIN: Oh, it was?

BIL: After all of our training, I think they sent the medics in the first wave.

WIN: This was a hostile action?

BIL: No, it was not more than-there was very little resistance. There was about

maybe a company of Japanese on the island. As soon as we landed they fled. Evidently,

they had boats on the other side of the islands in which they escaped. We sent out patrols

into the mountains, and we never saw any more of them. There was very little resistance

there.

WIN: So it was just kind of a typical army maneuver and everybody-

BIL: It was to see if we could to it, I think. They chose that island, I think, because it

was very little resistance offered. We were only there possibly a month-and-a-half

through the monsoons. Then we staged it at Milney Bay for another landing, which was at

Finch Haven, New Guinea. It's a peninsula about midway. Half of New Guinea is

Australian and half Dutch. Finch Haven was on the Australian end of it but very near the

21

WI LIAMJO N 0
line. There was more resistance there. Not at the fir t landing but snipers after we had set up a perimeter. They had high ground and w r abl to put th ir snipers in trees and we were harassed that way. That's the first enemy action that I aw on Finch Haven. From Finch Haven we gained a little knowledge of the natives their tribal dances, and their customs, etc. WIN: How long did it take you to secure that area? BIL: We had left before they had it completely secure. They moved in reinforcements and we were bothered by snipers and infiltrators. We had what they called regimental combat teams. One of them was in our brigade just as far as rations and allowances concerned. Their captain always told the men, "If you take prisoners, you will have to share your rations with them." It's kind of a terrible thing to say, but I heard him say it. These were the people that they left to clean up. I mean, they were mean. They were real mean fellows. All this time that we were carrying on the business of a radio net to all of our boat companies and headquarters company, and some other infantry regiments that were near, and we communicated, also, with the Australians. WIN: So your primary responsibility was to make sure that all of these different facets of the organization were in communication? BIL: That's correct. WIN: So they knew what was happening. BIL: With our 277 radios, we could copy United Press and Associated Press
22

WI L AMJO 0

releases. That's where this came from. Not the brigade part of it but th n ti n 1n WIN: Bill is showing us the New Guinea Ram which wa then w pap r th t th y sent out usually about four pages, both sides? BIL: Yes. Well, mostly two pages. WIN: Okay, two pages, two-sided. BIL: This first story is a story of one of my friends that was a radio operator Elton Lyles. He was a tech sergeant and he was one of our non-coms in the radio section. After landing at Wewak Island he volunteered to guard one of the linemen that was installing a telephone line to the perimeter. He was a Mexican kid, the lineman. Miles threw his carbine over his shoulder, he had three-field telephone that was put on top of it and they went out on this line job and six Japanese came out of the trees. They had evidently hid up until the perimeter passed them and tried to capture him. They didn't want to shoot him and risk alerting the company, so they bayoneted him. He lived for two or three days after in the field hospital, but he died. One of my very good friends. That's a Japanese bayonet there. I sent it home to my wife's father to see. WIN: So after you left Finch Haven, where did you go? BIL: The next place was Wewak. It is a small island that has an airfield on it, but it's less than a thousand yards from the mainland of New Guinea. It was a tough battle. They were able to reinforce because it was close to New Guinea. Two or three times we were almost driven off the island, but we did manage to survive and secure the island.

WIN: That was valuable because of the airfield. BIL: Right. WIN: They wanted that for air support. BIL: We were only there a week because of their ability to reinforce. They just abandoned it finally. It was a marvelous way that it happened. The Pacific was supposed to be a holding war until the war in Europe was over. Admiral Nimitz and General MacArthur wouldn't have it that way. They came up with this plan of bypassing the most resistance, cutting their supply and communication lines. It proved very successful; however, the army intelligence wasn't very successful. It depended on the natives and Australians that were native to the place for most of the intelligence, and some of it was bad. Of course, I guess that's the way it has to happen. That's why they ran into so much resistance at some places. Like the next landing we made was at Biak, a little island, you notice, on the map. My daughter drew this map. New Guinea looks like a dinosaur. That's the back of his neck. Biak is here. Goodenough Island is right here. Finch Haven is here. Then Wewak is in here. Biak and Numfor were the next landings of our brigade, and they were tough. Biak was a very bad place that had fifty-foot cliffs almost all around the entire atoll. There were so many caves that they could hide in. This one five-eight task force that I was telling you about, they devised a way to get them out. They would get hundred-octane gasoline from the air force and take it to the incline above the cave and pick holes in the side and role it down in the cave and throw a grenade after it. They had

24

W LLIAMJO ON

chances to surrender and they wouldn't. But Biak was one of th worst. h b ch t Biak were so full of dead people and dying people. WIN: You were then on the third wave in, second or third wave? BIL: On the Biak I was in the third. We set up our radio below the cliffs on the beach. Our communication was shore to ship, and ship to shore. WIN: How long did it take secure Biak? Did you do that while you were there? BIL: Yes. It took...

(End side A)

WIN: We were just talking about the invasion ofBiak and how long it took secure that island. BIL: It was less than a month and they had it pretty well cleaned up. We staged at Hollandia for the next landing, which was in the Leyte Gulf. I was in about the sixth wave in that one. I was just in the resupply and reinforce wave on Leyte Gulf. WIN: Okay. From there you moved up into the Philippines? BIL: From Biak to Leyte Gulf. WIN: Up in the Philippines? BIL: Yes. We were just a contingent that was attached to the 7th Cavalry Unit. We were assigned to them just for quarters and allowance. Then they shipped us back to Biak
25

WILLIAM JOHN 0

72

where our company was. We staged again at Hollandia forth landing at 1ngay n ulf

right here.

WIN:
BIL:

That's up on the northwestern shore of Luzon. Luzon is the most northern island. There was very little resistance there until

we were on our way to Manila. We went with the Cavalry to Manila. We stayed there two

months. Our contingent, our duties as prescribed by the plan, was to set up a net of radios

for resupply, like what equipment they needed for, say, to repair the water system or some

of the buildings that were necessary to be restored.

WIN: This was in Manila.

BIL: We were set up in the old German embassy servants' quarters, our radio. I was

on radio watch one morning and I got a call. They had some traffic for me. I had to go

outside to start the generator before I could answer. I charged out the basement door, and

who should I meet, but General MacArthur and his entourage.

WIN: Ran right in to them almost?

BIL: I almost ran into him. I snapped to attention, of course, and he looked at me

and didn't say a word. None of them said a word. They just went in and went around and

listened to the radio still calling me. I had to wait until they left before I could start that

generator. That's the only time I saw General MacArthur. I was as close as I am to you.

We had some real good experiences. That one thing that my wife heard on the radio

occurred while we were in Manila. We had a patrol come back from the walled city, and

26

WILLIAM JOHN ON

27

they said that there were a bunch of Filipinos in a drained s i 1n p 1· th 11
city up on the northern portion of it. The Japs retreated with th ir backs to th anil Bay but they were still able to fire mortars and things like that and they had d stroy d their home. They had moved into the swimming pool, which had been drained. This patrol told us about them. There were two or three families. They were well-to-do Filipinos and they had servants and a bunch of belongings. They asked us if we would go in and get them, and we did. I drove the truck. That's this one. But this newspaperman, he made his own version of it. He said we were returning to Manila from across the Pasig River and we just saw them and picked them up and brought them across the Pasig. But we actually went in and rescued them. There were about forty of them. My wife heard this on the radio down in Carbon County where she was teaching, and everybody heard it and they rushed over and told her about it. She had heard it, so she went to the radio station and they gave it to her, this. You can see the censor stamp and everything on it. WIN: It's kind of interesting how those things tum up, isn't it. BIL: Yes. The old walled city was a real hot spot. WIN: Did you have much contact with the natives either in the Philippines or in New Guinea? BIL: Oh, yes. The New Guinea natives, you can imagine, they were licking their lips when they looked at you. At that time there were cannibals and headhunters and everything like that. New Guinea has advanced to the point now where they are sending

27

missionaries out of there for the LDS Church. It's compl t ly dif£ r nt than it

ur1n

the war.

WIN: How did they treat you and how did you treat them?

BIL: With respect. We didn't bother them. They wanted to be our houseboy you

know, all of the time. If we were in the company area, we had perimeter tents. Each

morning we would find a big stock of ripe bananas hanging in the doorway. They tried to

be friendly. So we returned the compliment.
WIN: Did they want to be paid? Was that their motivation? BIL: They would rather have clothing. Like, they called them lap-laps. A tee shirt

was very valuable to them. A mattress cover, if they could wrap around their Mary's-

they called them Mary's, their women-that was pure gold. A mattress cover. That's what

they wanted.

WIN:
BIL:

Didn't have much use for money, but barter material was what they wanted. Money was worthless. In fact, some of the money that I have here, that

invasion money, they gave it to us just out of the desire to be our friends.

WIN: Were you able to communicate with them at all?
BIL: Some of them could. What they spoke was Pidgin English. If you have never
heard it, it's very interesting to hear them talk like that. I really enjoyed it. You could

catch bits here and there of it.
WIN: I see. Did you ever have a sense of how they felt about the Japanese as opposed

28

W LLIAM JOHNSON

7

to the Americans? BIL: They hated them. They hated them. WIN: They didn't like the Japanese? BIL: They never went near them if they could avoid it. Japanese I guess they killed a lot of the natives because the natives were war-like, but their weapons were primitive. I mean, they were no match. But we did hear several stories where the natives had ambushed one or two of them and did away with them. WIN: I know on some islands the Japanese had told the natives that when the Americans came they would treat them really bad, so the natives had committed suicide. I was just wondering if there was any of that kind of stuff there. BIL: You know, Americans, it doesn't take them long to become well acquainted, and it was that way with the natives. They would gather around us when we were eating chow, and we would throw them a tidbit once in a while. If they wanted it they'd eat it. If they didn't, they would throw it aside. It was completely different than their way of eating. But what amazed me with the natives, you would be under a mortar attack, and if you get a mortar burst in the top of a coconut tree it was really bad. All of the shrapnel went straight down. WIN: Just rained down on everybody. BIL: They weren't so bad if they exploded on the ground and you were down. But the natives, when they would knock down a coconut tree, would run out and cut the heart

29

WI LIAM JOHN ON

27

out of the coconut tree to eat. Yes, right in the heat of the battl . WIN: They wouldn't wait until the battle was over? BIL: No. Mortar shells exploding everywhere, and they would go out and cut th heart out of the coconut palm. But I could understand why. That was a delicacy. Oh that is good stuff. If you have ever tasted it, I don't know if you have or not but that is the heart of a coconut tree and it is the very best part to eat. Tender and it is big, about that long, like that, and it's delicious. I had occasion to taste some of it. The natives gave us some, in fact, but they were amazing. After they had been around Americans very long, they'd send one of their young to be our houseboy and clean up the tents, and like I say, hang a fresh stock of bananas every morning in front of the door. Papaya, mangos, everything. WIN: What about in the Philippines? BIL: They were more civilized. The natives of the Philippines were much more civilized than the natives of New Guinea. We had occasion to link up with the guerrillas that escaped to the mountains when the Japanese landed. They harassed the Japanese for all of the time that they were there. I have this one medal here. WIN: Bill is showing me his jacket from the war with his tech sergeant stripes and his ribbons. BIL: This is from the close order drill from the University of the Philippines. This guerrilla that we linked up with, we became very good friends. His name was Horacio

30

W LLIAM JOHNSON

7

Tomtorres. He says, "Bill, victory." WIN: Oh, he gave you that medal? BIL: And he gave me this. WIN: That's nice. BIL: I have treasured it. WIN: So there were guerrillas active all during the occupation. BIL: Very active. They did a marvelous job. It got so that everybody had been a guerrilla, but you know they hadn't, but this fellow had. WIN: And the Filipinos looked kindly toward the Americans? BIL: They did. WIN: They were liberated from the Japanese. BIL: They were so happy that it was amazing. They were throwing flowers at us. When we went into Manila, they were passing bottles of whiskey and things like that to the troops as they passed, and flowers. WIN: That could lead to some disorder. BIL: Yes. They were happy. They were under a terrible yoke for so long a time. WIN: The Japanese hadn't treated the Filipinos well. BIL: Very poorly. I showed you a picture of some of the Filipinos that they had killed as they retreated into the walled city. They refused to surrender. I think a few of them did, finally, but most of them had to be annihilated.

31

WILLIAM JOHNSON

27

WIN: Some were killed in there. After you secured the Philippin thi

ht

time? Do you remember a date, approximately?

BIL: Yes. It was in October of 1945, around the 1st of October.

WIN: In 1944 or 1945.

BIL: In 1945.

WIN: The war was over in August of 1945.

BIL: I was home November 2nd. I was discharged November the 2nd.

WIN: In the Philippines it must have been somewhat earlier that the Philippines were

taken.

BIL: A lot of the other islands had not been captured. Mindanao was still in Jap

hands.

WIN: In the Philippines, yes.

BIL: They were still mopping up Jap resistance. That's when the point system came

1n.

WIN: Helped to be married then, didn't it?

BIL: Yes, ten points. I had eighty-one points and it took eighty to come home. So

they released me.

WIN: Where were you when the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan?

BIL: We were tied up at Leyte Fueling Station. I have got pictures of it, too. That

crash boat was refueling. We were tied up there refueling, and I could put the radio that

32

WILLIAM JO N 0

27

was on the crash boat into the loud speaker on deck. I had it plugg d in d h d th '

flash. Of course, we were always listening to Tokyo Rose on th radio. h had r 1g d

music. Modem music. I don't know where she got it all. So we did enjoy that. W h ard

the news flash that they had dropped the atomic bomb.

WIN:
BIL:

Had you ever heard of the atomic bomb before that? No, never.

WIN:
BIL:

You had no idea? No. I think we may have heard it by rumor, if you know what I mean. There

was always some bad rumors, we called them. There were rumors that they were working

on something like that.

WIN:
BIL:

Were you gearing up for an invasion of Japan, mainland Japan, at that time? I would have been scheduled. We would have gone. We didn't go to Iwo Jima

and we didn't go to Okinawa. But our contingent would have gone on the next one, which

would have probably been in Tokyo. Had that happened, there would have been millions

and millions of people killed because every one of them would have resisted in Japan. I'm

sure they would. So I think the atomic bomb saved lives. I'm firmly convinced that it did.

WIN: The general consensus is that it did save not only American lives, but Japanese

lives.
BIL:

When you see one of these landings, it's something that is unbelievable, the

softening up before the invasion.

33

W LLIAM JOHN ON
WIN: Bombardment of ships and airplanes? BIL: Every ship in the harbor shooting big guns. Dive bombers screaming in -17 or B-24s hovering over dropping bombs. You wonder how anything could e ist in that area, but they expected it, I guess, and were dug in. WIN: Either in natural caves or they dug their own. BIL: Yes, there were caves in all of those islands, but they found ways of getting them out. WIN: That's why they invented the flamethrower, isn't it? BIL: Right. WIN: To get those guys out of there. What were your feelings when you made a landing? BIL: When I made a landing? WIN: Yes. You came in the second or third wave. BIL: I'll be honest, it was fear. WIN: You were scared. Were you able to channel into performing in a sharper manner or did it render you incapable? BIL: The only thing I can say is fear, worry. I saw the landing as necessary. WIN: Pretty well figure you would lose some friends? BIL: Yes. They flew us back from Manila to Biak after the Luzon invasion and landed at Peleliu, Palau. There were 9,000 Gis killed in that little island. That's why I say
34

WILLIAM JOHNSON

72

the intelligence was bad. They didn't realize that there wa maj r Ja....,~""_...,_.

th r .

And that happened several times because the intelligence was bad· th y ran int

resistance, which meant American lives.

WIN: Did you ever engage in trying to intercept Japanese messages or was that a

problem to someone else?

BIL: Did you read that meritorious citation we had? We had enemy jamming all of

the time, but we had several designated frequencies for the radio. It's farther back just past

that radio deal. But as soon as we would get an enemy jamming and we were unable to

read anything in our net, automatically we switched to a new frequency. If they followed

us, we switched to another frequency. We avoided them that way. But they were jamming

all the time whenever they could find us on their radios.

WIN: They were jamming you, but you weren't trying to intercept their messages.

BIL: No. They did break the code. I saw an interesting happening, also. In fact, I've

got an article about the Choctaw Indians. That was the code the Japanese were unable to

break. It was voice procedure and they talked in their native tongue, and the Japanese

didn't know what it was.

WIN: Yes. They did that with several Indian tribes. The Navajos were probably the

most famous code talkers.

BIL: Yes. But this tells about the enemy jamming that we overcame. And they

targeted radios. I had one radio destroyed by a mortar. You know, they tell you, if the

35

WILLIAM JOHNSON

7

mortar shell lands behind you, and then one lands in front of you r m the area you are in, which was very true. We had a radio set up in a littl d pr si n· I guess it was a shell hole. We were getting mortar fire and we expected to be hit sow moved out and one hit directly right on the radio and completely destroyed it 35-mm. WIN: How effective or reliable were your radios? BIL: We had a little SCR-284. It was a portable radio. It had a hand-turned generator. You had to have somebody with you to work the radio. That was the days of tubes. I mean, what do they call them? WIN: Vacuum tubes. BIL: Vacuum tubes. We always had a maintenance man with us and a bag of spare tubes, of course. WIN: That was before transistors. BIL: Those little 284s, I imagine they had a radius of maybe forty miles, low. It wouldn't have been very strong at that distance, but they were so wonderful as long as you had somebody that could turn that generator. The receiver, of course, was on batteries. You could receive, but unless they turned the generator you couldn't transmit. Then we had the 277. That was a giant radio that had to have a six-by-six truck built right on it. WIN: Wow. BIL: All there was on it was the radio and a place for the operator to sit, and that was all radio battery powered. We had generators on the truck that kept the batteries up.

36

WILLIAM JOHNSON

7

That's the one we could receive anywhere in the world and the on w c pi d nit d Press on for the newspapers. WIN: I see. What were your basic assignments then? Let's say you were going into a landing when the first waves would go. What would your assignment be? BIL: Well, if I was on the waves, I'll tell you how a landing goes. From the softening-up portion, the LCMs and the LCVPs, which were the assault boats-LCVP that is a Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel; LCM, Landing Craft Medium-would haul tanks and bigger equipment. But when they unload the naval APAs and the troop transports into these landing barges, after the barge is loaded, it goes out to an area where they rendezvous, they call it, and they just circle until all of the boats are loaded and they are circling in this rendezvous. The crash boat has blinker lights on it. It shows them on the deck of the boat. This is the crash boat. The wave commander rides in this boat, and he's watching this rendezvous operation, and he tells me to find the signalman, and you release first wave, and I get on the blinker light and send the signal, and they take off for the beach. Out of the circle into the beach. And then the second wave the same. The wave commander tells them when to go. That was the purpose of this boat. WIN: That was called the crash boat? BIL: Crash boat. They were made for the express purpose of rescuing downed pilots that were shot down in the water. WIN: That's why they were called crash boats?

37

W LLIAM JOHNSON

27

BIL: Yes. WIN: I see. BIL: When they were in motion at top speed, you can't see anything but th propellers in the water. It goes forty-five or fifty miles an hour with two Hall Scott twelve-cylinder motors on two propellers. WIN: So it gets up a plane and just rips? BIL: Oh, it would plane. You hang on. But in this pool effect, all of the radio operators that wanted to could have this duty and took turns. WIN: Rotate duty on crash boats? BIL: Yes. You stood radio watch in the company area in the regular net. I loved this because you could sleep dry and the food was good. There was a six-man crew, two seamen, an engineer, a cook, and a coxswain, and the radio operator, and they were real good boys. WIN: If you went ashore on one of the waves, then what would be your duties? BIL: On one of the waves, you'd have your portable SCR-284 radio, and as soon as you land-you are not in the assault forces-you dig that radio in and communicate. You've maintained radio silence until the beach was made, then you dug the radio in and reported to the net that you were set up. WIN: So the two of you would work together because you had to have the guy tum the-

38

WILL AM JOHNSON
BIL: Well, we had a team. We had two radio operators. On uld turn th generator and one would do the transmitting or receiving. Then you'd chang . W u u lly had a guard with us that carried a rifle. We had rifles or we could have had side arm .45 automatics, but we were supposed to have a guard because they targeted a radio. When that generator was winding, why, it was noisy. WIN: The generator was noisy when they cranked it? BIL: Yes. You could tum the continuous wave sound down that was the radio signals but you had big earphones. It wasn't so much the sound from the radio. It was that damn generator. WIN: It would wind like crazy, huh? BIL: We were fired on many times because of the noise that thing made. But, fortunately, we had one man wounded and that was all in one of the landings, and he was wounded by a Japanese that had been dug in or something that came out after the fourth wave that landed and shot this-he happened to be the generator man at the time. WIN: So is there anything else you want to say about your activities in the South Pacific? BIL: I am thankful for the point system. WIN: Okay. After the bomb was dropped and Japan capitulated, you were then with enough points within a month to come back. How did you get back? BIL: I came back on-they sent us to Manila from our company area. Our company
39

WILLIAM JOHNSON

27 2

was at Batangas in the Luzon Island. They sent us, those that had nough point th y sent us by truck to Manila. There was a barracks there. We had to wait for transp rtati n. They called my name to go on the USAT Clip Fontaine a beautiful boat. WIN: Was it?
BIL: We came back across in fourteen days.
WIN: Fast boat. What kind of boat was it?
BIL: It was a transport, but it was owned by the Dutch. That is why the name was
Clip Fontaine. WIN: It wasn't a converted tour liner or anything like that?
BIL: I think it may have been a cruise ship at one time. WIN: That is why it was so fast. You were lucky. BIL: Yes. And we had good bunks. Going over on the old Cape Perpetua, you were
that close to the guy on top of you. Big canvass-
WIN: Hammock type? BIL: Hammock type and claustrophobia. I wound up most of the time taking a
blanket and going up on deck.
WIN: So the Clip Fontaine got you back in style? BIL: Yes. At that time, they were putting it in the newspapers to the new arrivals.
My wife saw my name on the Clip Fontaine.
WIN: Where did you land?

40

WILLIAM JOHNSON

BIL: WIN:

Seattle, Puget Sound, and Ft. Lawton in attl . Fort Lawton in Seattle and Puget Sound.

BIL: We were only there, I think we slept there over night. Then they put us on a
train for Salt Lake.

WIN: BIL:

Put you on a train, and did you come back to Fort Douglas? Yes. Came back to Fort Douglas. I had a barracks bag with souvenirs in. I had

a Samurai sword. I had a Jap brigade flag with all of the trimmings. I had a Jap voltmeter.

I had a Japanese imperial marine carbine taken apart and put in a barracks bag, and a

telephone, a stainless old-type receiver telephone.

WIN: Oh, really?

BIL: And I had it on my bunk at Fort Douglas and we were in the dispensary being

examined prior to discharge. I had to stay a little longer because I was extra yellow and I

had malaria, they had already tested. While I was there, somebody stole the barracks bag

with all of those souvenirs in.

WIN: That is too bad, isn't it?

BIL: I felt bad about it. Some stateside commando, I guess. That and my dad dying

were, oh, I guess there were other things, but they affected me more than most anything.

WIN: So did you go back to Price?

BIL: I went back as soon as I could. I was a very good radio operator-an expert, in

fact. We looked for-I knew I had to go to work, and I thought about where I should go

41

WILLIAM JOHNSON

72

to work. I knew that the telegraph was used on the railroads. There w r thirt n characters difference between international Morse code and plain Morse. And o c ur CW is the international, and CLACKS was the Morse code. Thirteen characters dif£ rent and they sent me to Denver for a month to change over to the Morse code. WIN: The railroad code? BIL: Yes, on the railroad. WIN: Was this Union Pacific? BIL: No, it was the D&RGW. WIN: TheD&RGW. BIL: And they hired me. It only took me a month to change over. I just had to get used to the different sounds. It was while we were in Denver that the Atabrine wore off, and I had a very severe attack of Malaria. My wife called, and there was a military doctor that had just come back from overseas, and he wrote her a prescription for- he came and saw me. He said, "You've got malaria." He wrote a prescription for quinine and my wife took it to the drugstore. The pharmacist looked at her and he said, "We can't give you this. It's one of the essential drugs that we aren't supposed to dispense." Of course, she broke down and cried, and he gave it to her. I was in the hospital for two or three days there, and then they sent me back to Salt Lake. I chose the Salt Lake division to be on as a telegraph operator. I worked a couple of vacation reliefs as an extra man, then a little job came open in Kyune. Do you know where Kyune is? It is twelve miles north of Helper in the canyon,

42

WILLIAM JOHNSON
Price Canyon. WIN: Okay, I know where that is. BIL: It is where the "Y" was where the Helper engines cut off the train and turn d on the "Y" and then went back to Helper. That was my first job, midnight until eight a.m. We were in Kyune from January 16, 194-that was my seniority date-and we were there two years until late 1948. Then they promoted me to train dispatcher and we moved to Salt Lake, and that's where we have been ever since. WIN: Did your wife teach while you were in Kyune? BIL: Yes. She taught in Castlegate, which is twelve miles away. In fact, we lived in Castlegate and I drove up the canyon to my job. The winter of 1948 and 1949 was a terrible winter. The only way I was able to go up through the canyon was through a friend that ran one of the state road graders. Angelo Vescucci was his name. He would wait for me at Castlegate and I would follow him up to Kyune. We would plow a place for me to park. WIN: Good service, huh? BIL: Yes. Wonderful friend, he was. He was an Italian. I had lots of Italian friends down there. I was on the extra board train dispatching for sixteen years. That was all over the system, Denver, Pueblo, Salida, Grand Junction, Green River, and Salt Lake, and I worked all of them. In the second year, we had our daughter. The second year we had to open Christmas presents in a motel. I decided that was enough, so I resigned as a train
43

dispatcher and went back as a telegraph operator and bid in a wire chi f J b at nty-

first South in Salt Lake roper, and that's where I spent my time.

WIN: You left the railroad then?

BIL: No, I just went back to telegraph operating, Teletype and telegraph. But the

travel on that extra board as a train dispatcher was murder.

WIN: So you retired from the railroad?

BIL: After thirty-five years.

WIN: And your wife taught for thirty-one years?

BIL: Yes.

WIN: How long have you lived in Bountiful?

BIL: We moved here in 1964.

WIN: BIL:

How many children did you have? We only had the one. We had one daughter, and one granddaughter, and one

great-granddaughter. WIN: As you look back on your life and how it developed, what would you say that

WIN: Good teachers, and they covered the proper material? BIL: Then, the people in Valparaiso, Indiana, they were so wonderful. They treated the Gis with-oh, my, every weekend there was an invitation to come to dinner or take a ride out to Lake Michigan or something. Every one of us, 11 0 men and we would all get invitations to either go to dinner or somewhere like that. They were wonderful, really wonderful. WIN: That's good. You have quite a story. You had quite an experience. I guess war is never pretty, but if you establish some friendships and learn the things you were supposed to learn to do your job, it can be a beneficial experience. BIL: Yes, it was an experience I am glad I had, but I wouldn't like to do it again. WIN: Life is that way, isn't it? Some things you wish to avoid, but once you have had them then they are learning experiences. BIL: The bad parts are still with me, especially people like Elton Lyles who was bayoneted. WIN: Those things are never pleasant to think about. How did you lose you hearing? BIL: My hearing? Mostly through jungle rot. WIN: It wasn't any specific accident?
