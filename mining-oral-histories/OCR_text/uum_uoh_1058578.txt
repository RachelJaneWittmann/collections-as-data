 THIS I S AN INTERVIEW FOR THE URANIUM INDUSTRY ORAL HISTORY
GS:
WR:
Yeah, just tell them, Wiley, about the whole reason for going, they will understand. I think they're all for it, as a matter of fact.
We had two four horse teams and one single team, and an old mare, a bald faced bay mare for me and my brother rode, he was eight years old and I was five. (Airplanes
and cars are going by throughout this tape) Then we rode into Mexico, rode across the---?--- then on down through Gallup, New Mexico, out across the (Pite?) River. I don't

SUZANNE SIMON,
INTERVIEWING J . WILEY REDD ON THE FRONT PORCH OF HIS HOME AT 427 SOUTH 1ST WEST, BLANDING, UTAH, JULY 28, 1970 AT 10:30 A. M. (MSR IS MRS.. REDD) .
SS: Well, Mr. Redd, would you tell us about your early life in this area?
WR: Well--
MSR: It wasn't here, it was over--
WR: I went to Mexico in 1890.
SS: And what was your reason for going down there?
WR: Oh, my dad, he wanted to go down there.
ss: Did he just like the country or did he have a special
reason for going?
MSR: Maybe these girls understand Wiley, about polygamy.
WHO I S SPEAKING, AND DOROTHY ERICK ARE
know how long we was in there.
SS: How long did you live in Mexico?
WR: Oh, about twenty-five years. He vido 25 anos en Mexico.
MSR: Wiley you have to speak in English.

 J . GS:
WR:
GS:
WILEY REDD #1
That's all right, I'll translate into English, he says he lived 25 years in Mexico.
El carino que tengo par Mexico es de mi Corazon. Do you know what that means?
Yes, that's the love that I have for Mexico is from my heart.
Where the hell did you learn to speak Spanish?
WR:
MSR: Well, he had to learn it--
SS: He picked it up--
GS: I had to learn it, or I wouldn't have been able to come
and talk to you I guess. You'd better talk to them in
English, though, I guess.
SS: You lose us pretty fast when you start speaking Spanish
to us, even faster than you lose us when you speak English to us. What was it like down in Mexico in those years? Did you live together with other Mormon families down there.
WR: Well, yes it was a Mormon Settlement at (Green Pastures?) My uncle let me have an old cabin and more than that he cooked on the fireplace, for years, several years.
ss: And how many were in your family? How many brothers and sisters did you have?
WR: I don't know, I had quit a few--
MSR: Well, now I could answer that quickly. He has six
brothers and four sisters. 2

 J . WILEY REDD #1
SS: So there were eleven children.
MSR: No, there was two born in Mexico, two more. One in Bluff
on their way out, my age, she's 89.
SS: And you stayed then at the Mormon settlement until you
WR: SS: WR:
GS: WR:
were about twenty-five.
Yeah.
And then what did you do?
Well, I punched cows all my life. I punched cattle in Mexico.
In Mexico you ran cattle?
Yeah. My dad run horses for a living, horses and cattle. He had a lot of good horses when he went to leave for Mexico. He rigged these outfits up, my brothers drove
'em.
Who was your dad and your mother? Emil Hardison Redd.
GS:
WR:
MSR: Emil Hardison Redd, and the wives of Chamberlain Redd. SS: When you were 1iving in Mexico, how did the natives
there, the Mexican people there treat you?
WR: Oh, pretty good, they didn't kill me. They shot at me a
lot of times but they didn't hit me.
SS: Did they? Were they a little hostile toward the
settlement there?
WR: No, I wouldn't say they were. There was a revolution down
there in 1910.
3

 J. WILEY REDD #1
SS: And is that when you left?
WR: No, I--well, I left in 1911.
SS: And was it because of that revolution that you left?
WR: Oh, I suppose it was, I was working for my brother-in-
law, Ed.---?---, but he told me that if I wanted to come
back after the revolution I could,but it never quit.
SS: Well, in 1911 did you, were you already in the stock
business?
WR: No, I sold out all I owned down there.
SS: Sold out your stock down there?
WR: Yeah.
GS: Who did you sell them to?
WR: Oh, I didn't know--anybody that'd buy them. MSR: Well, and then when did you go to school? WR: Well, that was earlier--
MSR: A little later.
WR: 1906.
ss: You went where to school?
MSR: Cedar, Utah. Cedar, Iron County, Utah College, he went
three years there.
GS: You'd left the college and come up here for a couple of
years and then returned to--
MSR: And he worked in Nevada before that, though. SS: What were you doing in Nevada?
WR: Oh, my dang dad took me up there. He was an old man,
4

 J . WILEY REDD #1
crippled, couldn't do anything. He took me up there, and turned me loose. I didn't have any money.
MSR: He had to find a job and I couldn't get a job.
SS: WR:
SS:
WR: SS: GS: WR: DE: WR:
So what did you do? You didn't starve. (Laughter)
I worked for an old fellow, name of Wakeland and he was an Englishman and he was a good old fellow, and so was his wife. I worked for him for my board, and I worked, too.
What kind of work was that? Was that stock management or mining?
No, it was on a farm.
Farm?
Where was this, in Nevada?
Ely, Nevada.
What did they farm in around Ely?
Lot of land way down there. I drove a stage. Ely's huge, forty degrees below zero. Brrr.
ss:
WR:
SS:
WR: Oxborough, into St. George.
SS: What was it like driving that stagecoach?
What company did you drive the stage for?
Oh, he was just a fellow that lived there near Oxborough. Oxborough?
WR: T errible.
SS: Did you ever have any close calls with Indians or
weather, that kind of thing? 5

 J . WILEY REDD #1
WR: No, we killed the Indians. Yeah, it was cold, hell, yeah,
it was.
MSR: Tell the man about putting the mattress over you. Things
like that you know? I could tell you the story and I
wasn't even there then.
SS: Well, why don't you tell it then?
MSR: No, Wiley's memory isn't as good as it used to be.
GS: Well, you can kind of help him joggle it.
MSR: It was eleven years ago yesterday that he had his stroke. GS: What was this about sleeping with a mattress over you? WR: Well, when the mines all closed down, they went off and
left their equipment, and I got three mattresses. I put
two over me and one under me.
SS: Was this just when you had to stop overnight, out in the
open?
WR: No--down below Ely.
MSR: Well, did you have a boarding house, or anything? WR: No boarding house, no, I didn't.
MSR: Well, where would you leave the mail then, dear? Take it to the post office, and then back again?
WR: Yeah.
MSR: Now, this won't be recorded, will it?
WR: I don't know whether they'll record it or not.
GS: That is just fine.
SS: Yeah, that's real fine. Well, after you worked up in
6

 J .
WR: SS: WR: SS:
WR:
WILEY REDD #1
Nevada for awhile, you went back to Mexico?
Yeah.
And were you--
We went there about six months.
And why did you finally decide to leave and come up this way?
Oh, I don't know, we just come up here. It didn't take
more than a week.
MSR: Who went to see you first? Remember there in Salt Lake,
remember that, hmmm? WR: No, I didn't.
MSR: Well, then, when did you go to Salt Lake, you were in Salt Lake awhile.
WR: No, I wasn't there, it was just a few days.
MSR: Well.
GS: Wiley, were you there when the Mormons were driven out of
northern Mexico during the revolution? Were you there
when they all picked up and left for--
WR: No, I was up here then.
GS: I see. Had you returned to Mexico when you came out
working in Nevada, or when you came up to school in
Cedar, had you returned to Mexico?
WR: Yeah, that was before the revolution started. I was there
when the revolution started.
SS: What part did you play in the revolution in Mexico?
7

 J . WR: GS: WR:
DE: SS:
WILEY REDD #1
I recruited soldiers.
For which side?
For the revolutors. They give me a job because I could speak Spanish.
It pays to learn more than one language.
Well, after you came up to Salt Lake City and stayed awhile, what was your interest up there?
Oh, I didn't have any.
WR:
MSR: You had two sisters there dear, at that time.
WR: Well, they were teaching school down at Cedar, and I went
to school down in Cedar one year.
MSR: But that wasn't the answer to this question. They want to
know what you was doing in Salt Lake. You just went there
to visit? WR: Yeah.
SS: Wasn't this near the time of the beginning of World War I?
WR: It was before then.
GS: Did you serve during World War I?
WR: No, too old. Couldn't handle it. They left me here to
kill the Indians.
SS: Well, tell us about your Indian fights. Where did you get
involved with fighting Indians?
WR: Well, ah, two Indians robbed sheep, came down here and
resisted arrest and that's what caused the fight, and 8

 J . WILEY REDD # 1
they wouldn't give up. We went out here one day and Dan Machune killed both of them and old Posey.
SS: Oh, is that right?
WR: Charles Posey from (Meadow Rocks?) back by Sand Creek. MSR: Don't say I did because--
WR: Well, I shot at him, I stood just as ~ood a chance of
shooting him as Bill Brisbee did.
MSR: I know it, but it wasn't you, it was Dave Black that did
it.
SS: Who was it that killed them?
MSR: Dave Black.
SS: Dave Black?
MSR: Yeah, it was Dave Black that killed him.
WR: There was plenty that Dave did.
MSR: They were in a group, just like Daddy said, they were
firing at him, knew it was him on that little black horse galloping.
WR: I could have killed him if Dan Machune had kept his mouth closed. I had took three high powered rifles out there. I checked down under the hill and saw him, didn't know
who he was on a black horse. My nephew says that's our travel horse, don't shoot him, so I let him go. In a little while he went down by the creek whipping his mare on the hind leg underneath him. Then I knew what I'd
missed.
9

 J . DE:
WR:
WILEY REDD #1
Well, I've heard both good and bad about Posey. What were the problems that Posey was giving.
Oh, he was robbing everybody, stealing hay from them, and
feeding and feeding his horses.
MSR: Sheep can't (shrub?) you know, and oh, he was an outlaw,
a naked beast. ---?--- that come here for miles there isn't any that come here but I welcome them, but not that one.
WR: ---?--- I'd have shot at him, but it ain't mine, you know. You know, up on the rocks? The guy was Dan Machune.
DE: He would be what you'd call a renegade then.
MSR: Yeah.
DE: Well, this is after you'd already come over to this part
of the country, did you come to Bluff from Salt Lake
City?
WR: No, I came here.
MSR: To Blanding, to Blanding.
DE: To Blanding, mm-hmm. And when and where did you meet your
charming wife?
WR: I had a hell of a time getting her. DE: Did she play hard to get?
WR: W ell, yeah, plenty hard.
MSR: Well, now, tell the story, Wiley.
WR: (Laughs) Well, I lived here, and I used to ride a horse down to--
10

 J. WILEY REDD #1
MSR: I lived in Bluff.
WR: Bluff to see her. And a lot of them old guys down there,
they wanted to give me a bad time. They told lots of lies about me. I don't know whether she believed them or not, I guess she didn't.
SS: Was your family living in Bluff?
MSR: Oh, mine. Oh, yeah, yeah, my father--
SS: And were you born here?
MSR: Yes, I was born in Bluff. Our house, of course it's been
remodeled now, but some of the happiest moments of my life, moments that were spent down there. I used to be a clerk in the store. And then I went to the BYD for one year only, took up dressmaking. I get my books out now. Elaine Elliot was my teacher, and I got perfect on all of my drawings, you had to do them in ink you know. I planned dresses and everything, you know. And then I came back to Bluff and Wiley's niece told him that there was a fine girl in Bluff and if he'd behave himself, and be a good boy that he could get hitched. So he drove a horse from Blanding to Bluff, a horse, mind you. And sometimes when he'd come he'd meet up with opposition because I had
date.
WR: You never went with them though.
MSR: Oh, I did go up with them. When the cat's away the mice
will play. So, finally we decided. But, when I decided to 11

 J .
WILEY REDD #1
have him--should I go on and tell? It was in December the 12th, 1913 and there was snow that deep, and we went in a buggy, there were no cars, and we went to Salt Lake. We stopped at Monticello and Moab and we took the train from Thompson and was married the 12th day of December, 1913. You see, we've been married quite a few years.
I'll say.
You went to Salt Lake to be married in the temple there, huh?
SS: GS:
MSR: Yeah, married in the temple.
GS: Had you been married here before you left or--
MSR: No, no they trusted us--
GS: You d id n 't have any chaperon?
MSR: No chaperon, no. My mother and father, years before, they
went off in a wagon to St. George and was married, you
know. My poppa liked him his city girl, my mother.
GS: Of course they didn't have Wiley along either, though. SS: You said you took a train from Thompson?
MSR: Yeah, to Salt Lake. And we returned. We lived here in
Blanding--W iley and I.
ss: And have you lived here ever since?
MSR: Yes, in Blanding. We have five boys and two girls.
SS: Fine family. How did you get interested in uranium, or
what was there--
WR: Well, I know more about uranium than anybody. I know it.
12

 J . WILEY REDD #1
SS: Well, how did you learn about it?
WR: I read a book.
SS: A geology book?
WR: Yeah. (By H. Gregory?) You've got to know the formations
or you can't find uranium. When you come to a formation--
I located the first mine in the Shinarump formation.
SS: And where was that?
WR: At the Hideout.
SS: The Hideout in--
MSR: On Elk Mountain. They're still mining it.
WR: They're still mining it.
GS: How'd you happen to locate that, Wiley?
WR: Well, I found some float down there. I went down there to
look at the woods one day, picked up a couple of pieces of float, saw a draw, deposit. A really good mine come from that piece of float.
SS: Had you done any prospecting for vanadium, or radium before?
WR: Well, I worked for the biggest company that's ever been in here other than U.S. I knew Old Joe Weston. He hired me and I worked for him awhile, in that outfit I got tired of working for him, so I quit and decided to go
home. Idaho's got some real good mines.
SS: What were some of those mines?
WR: The Blue Lizard. Still does, still got ore in it.
13

 J . WILEY REDD #1
MSR: You get a million dollars, we'll go get that ore.
SS: Well, if we could find somebody that'd pay us ten dollars
a pound, we'd be out there, wouldn't we? I'd help with
pick and shovel.
WR: Don't use them anymore.
DE: Is that what you used in the beginning?
WR: Well, yes.
MSR: I'll say. He'd bring in his samples, you know, and test
them on his watch-callem? WR: Geiger counter.
MSR: Geiger counter.
WR: I never had a geiger counter in my life.
MSR: I know you didn't, but others--people around here dearie. GS: When did you work for U.S. Was it--
WR: Oh, I don't know. I couldn't tell you what year old Joe
Weston hired me. He's the man who struck this uranium. MSR: He's dead and gone now.
WR: They sent me out here to Red Canyon. I didn't want to
work for them, so I quit and went prospecting for myself, located some good mines. I guess they think I pulled a fast one on them.
GS: You hadn't located them before you quit?
WR: No. No, I never got down in there.
SS: Had you ever talked about that area to some of the other
people that'd been around, like John Wetherill? 14

 J . WILEY REDD #1
WR: Well, yeah, old John Wetherill was a good geologist. MSR: He was Dad's good old friend.
WR: I asked him if there was any place in San Juan County
where he knew uranium was. He told me about this place down here in Red Canyons, so I went down there, and sure enough, I located a good mine. I named it the Posey. Sold
it for five thousand dollars and got my money.
SS: Do you wish you'd kept this?
WR: Oh, no.
SS: Did you ever do any mining yourself? Or were you just
concerned with prospecting?
WR: W ell, mostly prospecting.
MSR: The boys--
SS: Did the mining?
MSR: Well, they hired someone to do it. Wiley was at this time
was custodian at the Natural Bridges while all this was
going on. SS: Oh, I see.
MSR: We were there for eleven years.
ss: And you lived out there?
MSR: Yeah, at Natural Bridges, six months out of the year,
Wiley.
ss: How did you come to get that position?
WR: Oh, a feller came around and asked me if I wanted it and
I told him yes.
15

 J . WILEY REDD #1
SS: And what did you do out there?
WR: Oh, contact the tourists that come out, help with the
roads. They won't talk to you nowadays.
SS: The tourists won't--?
MSR: No, the custodians--they just don't--they don't know the
country. And my husband knew every spot all around and everything, you see. And he could tell them all about it. These new guys, these college graduates that they send in there didn't know anything about the country, you know. And sometimes they'd shut the door on tourists that would come in. Now Wiley's sister in California went up there and they slammed the door in her face, you know, instead of making her welcome, you see, and giving you what assistance they could, you know. Now, we take anyone and ask them into our humble apartment there. It was a tent, boarded up then, in that time, and we'd make them
welcome, and sit next to them, and we'd have picture shows occasionally there in that little tent and everything. Oh, it was an interesting eleven years, believe me.
SS: Were there many people that came out there in the early times that you were there?
MSR: Oh, yes.
WR: Well, during the war there wasn't many but-- MSR: After that--
16

 J . WR: SS:
WILEY REDD #1
After the war they--was a lot in come.
Did you ever take them out and show them, guide them to the--
Oh, yeah.
I assume you're speaking of World War II.
WR:
SS:
MSR: Mm-hmm.
SS: GS:
WR: GS: WR:
What kind--go ahead.
I was going to ask about Hideout. Now it's a very important mine, it's been a real great producer that you found there. How did Uncle Seth happen to--
Oh, I sold it to him, for nothing.
For nothing, eh? Well, that's a pretty good deal.
It's as much as I asked for. I found two little pieces of float way down in the Cedar Mesa formation. I followed after the dog and found it. Well, old Seth he wanted it, and he pulled me out, and I finally sold it to him for five hundred dollars.
Was there a big ore outcropping there?
Quite a big one. Then the government come in and done a lot of business.
SS: WR:
SS: The claims that you had there in Red Canyon, the Blue Lizard and the Posey, did you find the Joe Bishop, too?
WR: Yeah.
ss: And what--can you think of what some of the others were
that you found in that area? 17

 J . WILEY REDD #1
Well, there's Joe Bishop, the Posey--
WR:
MSR: Blue Lizard.
WR: And the Blue Lizard are the best ones. They still got ore
in the Blue Lizard. Called to check the other day. There's a fellow mining it that's--these Shumways, they lease it, that doesn't do any good.
MSR: They didn't get a thing. They put out a lot of money too, believe me.
WR: Forty thousand dollars.
SS: Which Shumways was this?
MSR: Well, it this is--who is at the head? WR: Eugene.
MSR: Eugene, yeah--Eugene was the head.
WR: (To Dr. Shumway) Is he your brother?
MSR: No, cousin, and he--they didn't realize a thing, and then
afterwards they leased it to these--Pep took it over, Dad has not been well for years now. Pep took it over and he leased to Gude, a Mr. Gude that's here. There's three brothers here in town and this one that lives in (Gordon's?) house is the one that leased the mine. I don't know the man myself, but I know that there was three brothers, one lives down here at Kay Jones's house, and one at the Ray house, old house up there, in the other part of town. And then Gude the one that leased the
mine, has gone to New York now. 18

 J . WILEY REDD #1
SS: When you would go out prospecting, did you go by
WR: SS:
WR: SS:
WR: SS: WR: SS:
WR: SS:
horseback on pack trails?
Oh, yes, hell there wasn't no roads down there.
Yeah, well how long would you be gone when you'd decide to go?
Oh, five days.
And you'd what, take a pack horse and all your food? Did you have to carry water in there, or did you know where you could find water?
Lot of fresh water springs in there.
Did you ever have any close calls, back in there?
What do you mean?
Well, I don't know, did you get rattlesnake bit, or
(rim?) rocked at night, or any of those things?
No.
Did you raise cattle in this area before you were prospecting?
WR: Yeah, I had cattle here.
SS: And had you already been back in the Red Canyon and White
Canyon and Elk Mountain? WR: Well, yeah.
SS: So, you were already pretty well familiar with the country before you got interested in prospecting.
WR: Yeah.
DE: What did the bonus--deal of the government mean to you?
19

 J . WR: DE: WR: SS:
WR:
SS: WR: SS:
WR:
WILEY REDD #1
Ten thousand dollars.
Did you collect one of those AEC Bonuses?
I collected about four of them.
Is that right? The part boost on the ore, or the ten thousand dollars for--
Well, they'd pay ten thousand dollars bonuses, and I collected about four of them, I think it was four.
This was for new claims?
Yeah, it was produced ore.
Do you remember what claims it was that you got those
for?
Well, Posey is one, Blue Lizard is one, I sold that, give it away, that Joe Bishop claim. Elliot Redd, that damned engineer down there told me it wasn't any good, to give it to him.
You gave it to who was it?
SS:
MSR: Elliot Redd. And Shumway had it later on, didn't they? WR: Shumway jumped i t - -
SS: Oh, they did?
WR: They jumped it, and then got it back.
SS: How did that happen?
WR: They went down and filed on it.
SS: After you'd already staked a claim there?
WR: Uh-huh.
ED: Is this within that thirty or sixty or ninety day
20

 J . WILEY REDD #1 arrangement?
GS: There isn't a thirty day arrangement actually.
DE:
WR: GS:
SS:
WR: SS:
WR:
They had up to what was it, ninety days they had to file in the claim office?
No, I don't know much about it.
That's I thjnk, if you stake your claim and file it then it's yours.
And you had staked that Posey out, and had you filed the claim?
Yeah, yep, I filed as soon as I staked it.
But then, were you satisfied with the arrangement that was made about the ownership of that?
Well, yeah. That Blue Lizard had to do a lot of digging
on that before they found the ore.
MSR: There was so many interested in it, we didn't realize so
much out of it as owners you know.
SS: How many, who were interested owners in it--?
MSR: Donald and Leon Adams, and Wiley and Preston and Bob and
Lyman.
WR: I sold over five hundred thousand dollars worth of mining
stock in a month. I made a living from my holding.
GS: What was the name of the company?
WR: What do you mean?
GS: You said you sold mining stock. Do you remember the name?
MSR: No, I don't. Presto done it for us, he'd give us the 21

 J . WILEY REDD #1
check and that's what we were interested in.
GS: Was that the Blue Lizard Company?
MSR: Yeah.
GS: I think it was, wasn't it?
DE: Later on in the boom years, did you have many of the
promoters and fellows like that come to you? WR: O h .
MSR: Well, there was quite a few come through here, you know. WR: Oh, quite a lot.
SS: What did you think of their deals, did you get involved
with them?
WR: I worked for them for a long time, the biggest mining
company that's even been in here. There's only one man in a hundred that knows a formation. If you don't know the formations, you can't do no good.
SS: Is that USV that you worked for?
WR: N o .
SS: Well, that was pretty early in your-- WR: Yeah.
SS: Did you ever locate any claims for them?
WR: N o .
SS: No?
WR: They told me not to file on any. I had some ready, but-- GS: Where were these claims that you had ready?
WR: Well, down White Canyon. I guess they didn't trust me. 22

 J .
GS: WR: GS:
WILEY REDD #1
They had sent a man down. I don't know why they sent him, he came down, but he didn't do nothing.
Did you ever work for the VCA?
Well, yeah, I worked for them.
Did you ever try to get any of them to come down to the reservation to look at some outcroppings down there? Well, I told Bob he shouldn't file on that--
WR:
MSR: Well, Bob had that claim, that mine there. You mean on
the reservation?
WR: I couldn't file down there.
MSR: Bob tried to mine that, you know, and he had a narrow
WR: GS:
WR:
GS:
WR:
GS:
escape up on the hill.
You have to be an Indian to file on that.
Where was this that you had in mind, that you'd ask the VCA people to come down and look at it. Do you remember? Well, down near the San Juan River. All I knew was what I heard. I hadn't seen it.
I see. It wasn't the Monument Number 2, or the Monument Number 1?
Yeah, he bought those, old John Wetherill told me about them.
But you hadn't talked to the VCA about either one of
those fellows, that wasn't what you had in mind to show
them?
WR: Well, I talked to Mr. Ken Gerard, he was kind of a boss
23

 J .
GS:
WR: SS: WR: SS:
WR: SS:
WILEY REDD #1
or something. Didn't know if he had time to do it--told me a tale of lies.
He never did go down with you to look at this on the reservation, then.
No. But you can still find it down there.
Did you ever do any high grading?
What do you mean by that?
Well, did you ever find a stake when you were out, did you find a real high grade outcropping and load up a few sacks and bring it in?
No.
Okay, were you more interested in staking claims than
mining them?
WR: Yeah, I am not a miner.
SS: Later on, when the boom was on, did you sell many claims,
things that you'd staked that maybe didn't have a real
good showing that you weren't sure of?
WR: Oh, well, I don't know if I did.
SS: How did the uranium and prospecting change your way of
living, or did it?
WR: What do you mean?
SS: W ell--
MSR: Well, you remodeled the house, you know, we bricked it,
it was shingled to begin with. This was my mother's home and we took it over when--why we remodelled, carpeted it

SS:
MSR:
WR:
SS: Well, are there any more questions to--
GS: I've got two or three, one to you, Lilly. Who were your
mother and father in Bluff?
MSR: Hause Joseph Nielson--
GS: And your mother?
MSR: And Ida Evelyn Lyman Nielsen.
GS: Was he a brother of Jens Nielsen then?
MSR: Yeah, Franz and Aunt Margaret, Aunt Carolyn and Aunt
Cindy. See, my grandma had the large family and the other wives, he had three wives, the other wives just had a few children, Ryan, Freeman and Aunt Nan, and Margaret and Julian.
GS: Then Jens Nielson was your grandfather?
MSR: Oh, you meant the old man, did you?
GS: Uh-huh.
MSR: My father was his oldest child, Franz Joseph and Kist en
was his wife, Kisten Nielsen.

though and put new windows there in the front. Well, a window was there, but it was poor, you see it was cracked and everything. And--
Were you able to do some things that you might not have been able to do before?
Oh yeah, yeah, you bet. Daddy made this room of
(streams?) his.
---?---

 J . WILEY REDD #1
GS: Did he have more than one wife?
MSR: Yes, he had three, that's what I say, the other two
families--my grandmother had the large family, that was Jens and Franz and Joe, and Margaret and Cindy and Carolyn.
GS: Wiley, what do you remember about the colonies in Mexico? So you lived in Jaurez, did you?
WR: Yeah, for twenty-five years.
GS: But you said that your uncle gave you a job running his
cattle up in Jaurez?
WR: No, it wasn't there, but somewhere.
MSR: Well, you said that was so at the time and I thought you
were mistaken.
GS: Who was it that you worked for down in the colonies,
W iley?
WR: Si McDonelly.
MSR: Si McDonelly.
GS: Do you remember when the Mormons were kicked out of
there?
WR: Well, I do, yeah, I remember.
GS: How long had you been up there then? WR: Oh--
MSR: When was that, when did that happen?
WR: '13.
MSR: Well, you come in '12.
26

 J . WILEY REDD #1
WR: '11
MSR: Huh? You come in 1 11, did you? Cause we were married in-- WR: D idn't---?--- then over there.
MSR: Okay.
GS: So many of . those people that left Mexico came here to Blanding and settled down. What was the reason for that?
MSR: Well, they had to come somewhere.
GS: But they had the whole world as a choice and yet they
MSR:
WR: MSR: WR:
MSR:
came here.
I don't know, but so many of the Mexico people are here. Lem and Tom Black, you know their father? And Ben Black-- When we was fighting Indians out here--
And Connors and--
Them Indians they was--gee, when the guys came over from
Mexico they were so scared of 'em.
Well, it was, he was a Mexico boy that killed a man, Dave Black. You remember old man Dave, he was the father to Lem and Tom that had the service station up here, you know.
Old man Guy hated him, and just--
WR:
MSR: But that's what goes down in history, that it was Dave
Black.
SS: There was a big railroad through here.
MSR: Oh, my God, you should have seen Wiley after he come back from the mountain. You know, Lem Redd is Wiley's oldest
27

 J .
WILEY REDD #1
half-brother. There was eleven sons in the L.H. Redd family and Wiley is the only one left, for four years past, and he's lived longer than any one of the brothers, too. But Lem used to come down here and sit on the back steps and talk to me and try to comfort me. "Now Lilly, this just had to be, and I'm sure Wiley will come back all right." But when he come he was a nervous wreck and didn't even smile. And he'd been out there in that, five days tracking them. Oh, it was terrible hard.
SS: Were you that long catching him?
MSR: Yeah, they were on the trail for that long, from going
here and there.
WR: We kept telling them to give up. They thought we'd run
like the Colorado cowboys did. But we didn't run when
they shot at us.
SS: Was there a band of Indians that was with Posey then? MSR: Oh, yes, yes, uh-huh, squaws and papooses.
WR: Twenty squaws and papooses and seven bucks.
GS: How many of the people from around here were in the
party?
WR: Oh, there was quite a lot, I'd say--
GS: Twenty or thirty or more?
WR: Oh, I'd say about twenty.
SS: Well, Dorothy, do you have any more questions?
DE: No, I think they've been pretty well answered. 28

 J . WR:
WILEY REDD #1
Somebody dug old Posey up, he's gone now. His bones are not there.
Do you know right exactly where he was buried?
Land, yes. I went out there and dug him up.
DE:
WR:
MSR: He has his picture, after they dug him up, sickening.
GS: WR: SS:
WR:
GS: WR: GS: WR: GS: WR:
SS:
WR:
Do you have a picture, do you have that picture? Where's the picture?
I understand there's--is it a yearly pilgrimage out to find his burial place?
I--No, It's the only one knows where he's buried. Everybody believes he--
Did you ever go back and try to find him?
Well, hell, I've been out there lots of times.
But he's not there any longer, eh?
No, somebody--
Who do you think took him?
Well, I've got a magazine in here that says either the government or the Indians. The Indians don't have nothing to do with a dead man and the government's too damn lazy. So you don't have any idea what did happen to his bones, eh?
No, there's a fellow in Holbrock that asked me if I'd take him out there, said he wanted a piece of skull. When I couldn't find him, I went to Holbrock and talked to
him, but he denied taking it, old (Clance Lee?).

 J . GS: WR:
WILEY REDD #1
Maybe he got resurrected.
And then, the prisoners came down that night said, one of them, big one, the meanest one of the outfit said, how many Mormons killed? And I said, you didn't kill any Mormons. And he said, "Why?" And I said, "Cause you can't shoot."
There wasn't anybody from around here that was--
No, they didn't kill a soul.
Well, were all the bucks that you were chasing, were they all armed?
Oh yeah, hell, yes. They hid their guns when we come down, and then went back and dug them up.
You never did go look for the guns?
Well, they went back, they dug them up then. I got a gun, I took away from Brother Hillard, when they started they took all the guns from his fella. I got a gun, we had our attorney and Clyde didn't have sense enough to keep it.
SS: WR: SS:
WR:
GS: WR:
Who did you give it to? Traded it with Edward Lyman.
GS:
WR:
GS: Hmm? Has he still got it?
WR: No, he traded it off.
SS: What kind of arms did the Indians have, did they have
primitive rifles?
WR: Oh yeah. Old Posey was the only one that had a high
powered rifle. Then the Unites States marshal took it, he 30

 J . WILEY REDD #1
didn't have no use for it.
GS: What kind of a--you say a high powered rifle, an 0.06, or--
WR: Yeah, an 0.06.
SS: W ell, the U.S. marshal that was here, was he
investigating the trouble that had been here, or--
MSR: Where were those pictures? They've been moved, I can't
see them there?
WR: I left them on the shelf there.
MSR: No.
WR: Get that history of mine, please.
MSR: Now that's a little incident of--that happened a true
story, that was put in the paper here. I was with him
when i t happened.
GS: Yeah, I remember reading that, it was very interesting,
it really was.
WR: True story. That's a true story. I was trying to get ---
?--- for him. And he told me he was trying to kill me. GS: Yeah, that's an interesting story. I'd like to make a
copy of that to go along with your tape here.
WR: Well, you can take it.
GS: Well, we can get a copy made of it.
SS: Yeah when we get back. Is that an earlier picture of you?
WR: N o .
SS: Is this Henry Mike any relation to Jim Mike? I haven't

 J .
WR: GS: WR: GS: WR:
WILEY REDD # 1
finished this.
Ah--
Jim Mike's still alive, isn't he?
Yeah, he's getting pretty old.
Was he there during that fight?
Yeah, that old son of a gun come up there. Got a bullet hole through his blanket and jacket.
Well, are there any more questions that you all have--- I've got a history in here I want you to read.
Okay.
Be glad to.
SS:
WR:
GS:
SS:
WR:
GS:
WR: Yeah. Once. GS: Oh, did you?
Old Pancho Villa told me not to trust anybody.
Did you ever know Pancho Villa, did you work for him?
WR: Yeah. That book is in there--
MSR: I'm not looking for it, I'm looking for Posey.
DE: Well, that's when he said he was recruiting for the
rebels.
GS: Did you really work for Pancho Villa, did you-- WR: Yeah, I worked for him.
GS: What did you do?
WR: Carried messages for him.
GS: You met him personally?
WR: Yeah, he was down in Agua Prieta. That's where I lived
32

 J .
WILEY REDD #1
there. That's where they had the last f i ght. What were you doing in Agua Prieta?
GS:
WR: I was working for my brother-in-law .
GS: WR: GS:
WR:
GS:
At the mines?
No.
Well, tell us a little bit about Pancho Villa, what he was like, was he--
Well, he was a good fella. He never harmed the Mormons. He was a friend of the Mormons for many years in Guadalupe. I've got a picture of him.
Oh, how did you get the picture? It wasn't one that you took at the time?
No, Oh, I bought it from somebody.
WR:
MSR: Well, I can't find those pictures. I thought maybe he had
one on the wall here, of those last of Posey that was dug
up.
WR: Oh, who's got it, are they on the wall?
MSR: I can't find it, Daddy. I know it was down on the buffet
on one of those shelves, and they're not there now. Where
could they have been put? WR: I'll go see.
MSR: Oh, well, it wouldn't do any good to look at it.
GS: I'd like to get a copy made of one of them, you know, just to go along with the transcript here, it'd be very
interesting. Were you there that day that they dug Posey 33

 J . WILEY REDD #1 up?
MSR: Oh, no. It was done, after, nobody knows who dug him up. WR: What do you mean, digging?
GS: No, I mean right after he was shot, some of the young
people, you were among that party that went out--
WR: Old Brother (Hansen?) was there.
SS: Well, why did they want to dig him up?
WR: Well, they wanted to know whether he was there or not. MSR: And so they went out and .they put a wire around him and
held it around a tree and there he was.
WR: You can't find them pictures.
MSR: No, I don't think you could, Daddy.
GS: Well, you might look around a little if you find it--why-
MSR: I will.
GS: That's all right, Wiley.
WR: ss: WR:
I know where I've got it-- W ell, we--
It's on that shelf there.
MSR: I know it, darling, that's where I've looked.
DE: We want to thank you so very much for talking with us
this morning and giving us your time.
WR: Well, I didn't do much of a job with it.
GS: It was very interesting.
DE: That was very very fine, very interesting. [END OF INTERVIEW]
