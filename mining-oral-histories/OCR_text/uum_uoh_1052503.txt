 THE FOLLOWI NG I S AN INTERVIEW WITH RALPH THUL, BY CLARE ENGLE AT URAVAN, COLORADO, ON AUGUST
[ T H I S I S P A R T OF T H E U T A H U R A N I U M O R A L H I S T O R Y TAPE #1.]
CONDUCTED 5 , 1 9 7 0 . P R O J E C T .
CE: Thank you very much, Mr. Thul, for the wonderful reception you've given me. I feel very lucky to have come into Uravan in the manner in which I did and to find someone as cooperative and friendly and helpful as you've been. I've enjoyed the several hours I've spent with you. It's been about five, hasn't it? Before we begin talking about what you do for Union Carbide and your contributions, specifically, to the uranium industry, will you tell me where you were born and where you were raised and educated?
RT: I was pretty much a product of the Midwest, born in Insends, Indiana about the same time that Red Skelton was. He's better known in town. I left there and came to Colorado for about ten years as a safety engineer with Union Carbide in this mill. I probably have during that time worked with 50 to 60 staff people who have passed through here, training to go into other mills that the company operated in the area at the height of the recent boom and have enjoyed living
in Uravan during all of that time.
CE: What did you do before you became safety engineer?
RT: I was a production foreman and process engineer with International Harvester and Whirlpool Corporation. I

 RALPH THUL # 1
was in process engineering when they decided they needed a stronger safety department, and so I had to start from the ground up there. They gave me a quick background in safety. I enjoyed the work very much.
CE: Tell me specifically what you do as a safety engineer? I've seen of course, this afternoon and part of this morning.
RT: We feel that the most important thing that we can do as far as making our areas safer is to educate the people. Basically we feel that we have all of the equipment guarded so that it is safe to operate if it is operated properly and the people know what can harm them. So I think education is the main factor in the safety engineering work that is done in this area. The whole safety engineering field is constantly undergoing a change in an effort to improve communications and to get people better to understand why they should follow the safety requirements of a job. We hate to call them rules,
because in this day in age, rules conjure up some
anti-feeling, I think as much as anything.
CE: Will you describe what we have done this afternoon for a scholar who might listen to this tape, so that
he may understand better what's involved in Uravan, specifically?

 RALPH THUL # 1
RT: We saw a number of different types of ore being
received to be processed in the mill. The sampling is done by getting the ore split down across each load so that you have a statistically accurate representation of that load for the AEC and for our own use. The ore is ground to the fineness of river sand so that when it stays in contact with sulfuric acid the uranium and the vanadium are leached or put into solution by the sulfuric acid so that they can be separated and precipitated as yellow cake that you saw and put into the drum to go out. The ferric vanadate which is a crude product goes on through and dries similarly to the yellow cake, to the exact same type of hearth and goes out by the truckload. All of this is basically simple chemistry because the uranium and the vanadium are not intermixed chemically with the sand there. They are on the outside of the sand grain.
CE: And explain too, first of all, the areas into which we drove.
RT: The Long Park area represents about 60 years of mining experience from the standpoint of the early radium extraction that was done from ores. They were actually hand picked out of these mines. The whole area that we drove over was inter-laced, honey-
3

 RALPH THUL #1
combed actually, underneath with mines that are quite thick. It would be an ideal place to have a bomb shelter except you could never get enough water up there to wash the children's faces, let alone clothing and other things that would be involved.
CE: There aren't any artesian wells up there?
RT: No wells~ And then there would have to be considerable ventilation. But from a health standpoint as far as radium, there would be not exposure outside the mine. There would be many places to play. The winds in this area indicate that we
would never have any fallout from any major target. In other words, if Salt Lake City were a major target, the wind from Salt Lake goes north of here and Albuquerque would be south and away from us and Denver, of course, goes the other way on the
mountainside. So from a civil defense standpoint this is a very good community, but not practical as far as being a place to send a great number of people.
CE: Because it's not accessible?
RT: It's not accessible, and the water supply would be
restricted. The water supply from the old mill site was the river and people drank it and they still drink it in some places up the river without any treatment. This is rather risky because the river can
4

 RALPH
THUL # 1
quite easily be contaminated even though there is a continuing effort . We recent ly [installed a] modern sewage plant [that] most of the towns have. But before that the untreated sewage was the principal contaminant of the river. We have t wo f a irly deep wells and we chlorinate and process our water so that
it's--
CE: Before it's--
RT: It's safe. We know it's safe. Every two weeks it's checked by the Public Health Service.
CE: But it's chlorinated before it's used. I thought this was artesian water that was just used in its pure form.
RT: No, we actually chlorinate, and phosphate and treat it to cut down the iron and have a regular piping system. We have a separate piping system for irrigation water for people that water their lawns
with it. Sometimes this presents a problem because the people that come in and don't know this will drink out of these faucets on the side of the house. There again one of these matters of communication. We have these people coming in to paint or trim trees or things like this. We assume that they know that this isn't water to drink, but until they're specifically told, they have no way of knowing because they come
5

 RALPH
THUL # 1
from areas that where if the faucet has water in it, it's drinking water. We have a number of things actually that are unique about this town. Some of them make life maybe a little more difficult to live since it's a company town and you're restricted as to where you can put your fence. You can't always remodel the house just the way you would like to all on your own, [you're] pretty much assigned a house according to the length of time you've lived here and also the position that you have. Some people don't care to live under these conditions and live in towns away from here and drive to work. Some people want to do some ranching and they live away from town. Most of the people in Uravan are here because they're outdoors type people. They like horseback riding,
hunting, fishing. They're a more self-reliant type than the average in the whole country, I would say. They need to be because they have to be resourceful to get things done in this area in a number of ways, and they really abhor city living. Many of them even just like visiting the city. This is reflected in some of their children that have gone to trade schools and places like this. They say, "Well, I'11 never 1i ve in Denver. " We have a son taking electronics courses, and most of the jobs open are on
6

 RALPH
THUL # 1
the West Coast. "Well, I wouldn't want to live on the West Coast. It's too crowded." So there's probably some little difference in the people from that standpoint. Digression. The recreation that's available is primarily athletic type, outdoors type. The people I think reflect that in their coloring, in their build. You don't see a lot of fat men around here. I notice this when I go to cities quite often. We had more of a social structure than we have at the present. I think you still will find some stratifying
in that, for instance the Congregational Church never had an hourly worker to attend it. It was all the blue collar, the professional, and the school teachers, and to a large degree this is true of the same church in Nucla and Naturita. As I mentioned at one time Uravan was the second largest town in the county.
CE: When was this? See if you can remember.
RT: Around 1962, I think, was probably the peak as I remember it. Now it could have been more crowded
before that. Some of the outlying camps were larger than it. But we had a very large trailer park across the river that I would never drive into because it was so crowded. Children filled the streets, and this is one of the real bad things that we have in town
7

 RALPH
THUL # 1
now. The streets are used for playgrounds much too often. People that come through here may not always realize this. It's unique that even in the days when security was the most important thing, the county road runs right through the middle of the mill practically. We have good security now because we have people working around the clock, the shift foreman driving around.
CE: Those two men we talked with as we were driving out to go up to the mill. Were they security people? Washburn was his name.
RT: No, he's the maintenance superintendent. They're not security people as such. We have foreman security you might say by the fact that the foreman is making his rounds down here. This could be a problem where we have weekends where we're shut down, which we might have. We tried this once before. People like the four days off. They work Tuesday through Saturday is one
week, Sunday through Thursday is another week. These are back to back, and then they have four days off. Many of our shift people have four and five days off now. That's the arrangement.
CE: Do you want to talk about safety in the mill? r commented to you several times the emphasis you put on regarding wearing safety glasses, helmets, and now
8

 RALPH THUL # 1
of course the guardrails around the equipment.
RT: Yes, I don't remember whether it was on the recording where I was talking about the education or not.
CE: You began that.
RT: Yes, I digressed. The basic safety as it started many
years ago was getting machinery guarded so that people couldn't get their hands in belts and gears and things like this. This was the thing that all of the companies that adopted a safety program started off with. As they put in new equipment, it was automatically guarded. So this, in most safety engineers' eyes is sort of a secondary thing today because the history of safety has included this type of guarding as a backdrop. In other words, there are standards as to how high the handrails are and there's a toe board by each catwalk so that you can't kick something off the cat walk onto somebody below you. With the large amount of sulfuric acid that we use we have constant exposure to over a hundred people a day getting splashed of acid or liquor containing considerable acid, in their eyes. Since we know we have this exposure, we are committed to do everything that we can to protect the people from this. It isn't always practical to have double-walled pipes, which we do have in some places so that the
9

 RALPH
THUL # 1
acid goes through the first one and we get some warning. The personal protection that the people have in the form of eye protection is an important thing as you could see from the number of giasses that we have broken. We try to stress this off the job because the same piece of metal that can fly off from a grinder or a grill at work can do the same thing when you ' re working under your car. Try to carry every safety theme such as fire protection, freedom from falling, into the home area and the recreation area as well as in the mill, because the arm you break falling off of a faulty ladder at home hurts just as bad, takes just as long to heal as the arm you break at work. The things that cause fires at
work, trashy conditions and accumulation of trash at home are very parallel, so it's quite easy to carry the theme of what we're talking about each month at that mill into the home. We frequently have a special program especially on highway driving and this type of thing at vacation time to warn people about the effects of too much sun. Most of the fellows do a lot of their own mechanical work, so it isn't unusual to see safety glasses and goggles in their own shops at home, which is to us a real good indication that we have reached them. Safety is sort of a philosophy
10

 RALPH
THUL # 1
really, and you can't expect somebody to come in and sort of punch a button and say, "Okay, I'm going to work for the company for eight hours and I'm going to be safe," and then jump in his car and tear down the road at 40 miles per hour in a 15 mile speed limit. You just don't switch personalities that quickly. But
I think the work that we do in protecting people has to be an around the clock thing. Safety is largely humanitarian. So here again your humanitarian aspect doesn't cease at five o'clock or start at eight. Any concern you have for people is a thing that you live with all the time.
CE: Well, walking on those catwalks could be precarious. Frankly, I would think that people would have to be careful.
RT: It becomes second nature. You don't think about it. For instance, when I worked in refrigeration manufacture I walked on roller conveyors, and our insurance inspector would never go near them because
he was afraid he would step on one and fall. I walked on them eight hours a day and was used to them. Possibly it was hazardous. I take a dim view of it as a safety engineer, but as a process engineer I didn't. But the same with the catwalks, you get .used to them. This is one of the real problems you have
11

 RALPH THUL # 1
with your experienced people is that they get used to things. Just like people get used to handling dynamite and don't respect sometimes electricity. The things that we respect that are hazardous are seldom things that hurt us, and the people that get hurt usually get hurt on simple things because we planned the complicated things with safety in mind and sometimes we overlook very simple things.
Do you want to go back ten years to the time you came here and tell us why you came and what your objectives were? You said you were initially hired as an engineer. Tell me what Uravan was like when you came.
RT: The reason I came was that Whirlpool, which primarily manufactures for Sears and Roebuck, was overexpanded and they decided that their costs were too great and they had to cut down 10 or 20% in each department. I was assured that our department wouldn't be affected and I was one of the last people to know. I had always wanted to live in Denver or the West so I started looking in this area for opportunities and
there were so many people in all categories. For instance, I helped two other fellows, one got a job in Orlando, Florida, and one in Minneapolis, and somebody else brought me the newspaper clipping from
CE:
12

 RALPH THUL # 1
the Grand Junction or Denver Post about the opening out here.
CE: As a safety engineer.
RT: As a safety engineer. The company at that time had
the Uravan mill and the nuclear division which included the atomic processing plants at Paducah, in [KentuckyJе So they asked me to go down to Paducah for an interview, and this was on a Wednesday or Thursday. The next day I got a telephone call asking me to be in Grand Junction the very next Monday with my wife, as a part of the interview to come to Uravan and be interviewed for the job. I had been to Salt Lake and on down to the California desert in the early days of World War II; I signed in at Salt Lake in the Replacement Depot right behind Jimmy Stewart. This was when he first started flying, and I ran across him several other times. But this was in the winter and it was cold in the east and it was warm out here and it was very attractive to me. We didn't know that about 40 miles of road between here and Grand Junction was a dirt road. My wife went to town to set up checking accounts and came back and told me that it was a dirt road, and that was the first time I knew that it wasn't paved all the way to Grand
Junction.
13

 RALPH CE: RT:
THUL # 1
Because you were flying.
We flew in, yes. The company at that time had its own plane and pilot. The plane flew into the Nucla airport. Also at that time there was a small airport above Uravan. There were about seven people that had their private planes up there. I think there are still a couple up there now. During the early days-- Who maintains that, by the way?
They maintain it themselves.
Do they?
Yes. The company loans them equipment to take. But they had a real rough time with some Texans that
CE: RT: CE: RT:
wanted to stake that ground for uranium claims during the '50s, and they actually almost had to go up there with shotguns to keep them from taking their dozers in, because all they did to stake a claim at that time as you may know, is dig a little hole in the ground and say, "Okay, this is a mine site." There are still a number of those around and, of course, they were even more in evidence ten years ago. We were going to either the Gas Hills, Green River, or Slickrock Operation. Uravan at that time was more or
less a training ground.
CE: For the professional people?
RT: For the professional people. Primarily for the
14

 RALPH
THUL # 1
metallurgical type people. Metallurgy, as applied to the uranium industry is the extraction of the ore, where in most places metallurgy means the hardening
of steel and this type of thing. So sometimes you need to explain to some people who are not acquainted with mining that the metallurgical type are really chemical engineer type. These people went as mill superintendents and department heads, operating people of this type. Many of them have been to Rifle, and you can go to many places--now you're initiated
into the group--and you'll find that the Uravan boarding house is known halfway around the world anyway. One of the men that I wanted you to talk to who had radium exposure is in Uganda, southern Africa now, so I don't think you'll make that contact. But very interesting. He was filling needles for use in hospitals with radium and didn't know; he got this imbalance of the red corpuscle. But this was in the
'30s and he's still working for us. The town was quite crowded. There was a long list of people looking for houses. Currently we have torn down a half a dozen houses; you might want to go out and take a look at it.
CE: It was built about '43?
RT: I think it was. Now I know you're going to be a lot
15

 RALPH
THUL # 1
sharper on exact dates, especially be:fore 1960 and even after that, because time has a way of evaporating sometimes or having difficulty in my mind associating certain things with any specific time.
When the Manhattan Engineers came in here looking for uranium.
Yes, that's the mill site across the river that we could see the foundation of. Some of the tailings that weren't used or further, fully processed are covered up over on the other side and are utilized those for ponds.
Apparently this mill was completely shut down and just that mill was running and people from here were hired as consultants.
Then I think they did receive ore here at this mill and ran it later, because I know that there was always a problem of what they were going to do about
CE:
RT:
CE:
RT:
the uranium that was in the ore that people weren't
supposed to know about.
CE: Now I interrupted your train of thought.
RT: No, I think I was determining the point.
CE: You said it was very crowded when you came in the
early '60s.
RT: Oh, well, and then the surrounding area had many more
16

 RALPH
THUL # 1
people living in shacks along the river and more little trailer parks on the fringes of this town and the other towns, and also the community by the Golden Cycle mine which was a community by itself which was on about the third bench above here. They just stayed up there rather than drive back and forth to work. This was closed down at the end of the major AEC procurement.
CE: About '64?
RT: Yes. This in turn affected the number of people that
traded at the store and at the boarding house for instance. In the early '60s the boarding house had its own baker. He baked goods for the store also, and this was quite popular.
CE: It looked as though you have a baker today. This marvelous lunch we had looked as though it was all home-made, even the bread.
RT: Well, yes. I'm sure the rolls were, yes. But that was a full-time baker. If you wanted some special cake or a batch of cookies, all you had to do is tell him the day before and they baked that night, and that was along with everything else he put out. Most of the
people that eat at the boarding house regularly live in the bunkhouses nearby, and the number that are there will vary with the amount of ore that's being
17

 RALPH THUL # 1
hauled and amount of construction work that's going on, primarily in the mill.
CE: How much has that varied over the past 10 years?
RT: In the average summer they will usually have around 30 or 40 at the noon meal, construction people that are in. The mill is continually being changed to improve the quality of the product. This requires
more work to be done that our people can do. So it's handled by outside construction people with the consent of our local people. They realize that we can't hire 30 people and keep them only a few months until the project is over. The construction people follow our safety rules when they come in here. They know when they bid on the job that they will have to wear the same hard hat, safety glasses, and hard-toed shoes that our people wear and have a reasonably good housekeeping program and follow the rules that we do.
CE: What about contract miners? How much can you impose on them as far as injury is concerned, and how much must they impose upon their employees?
RT: We do everything that we can, and this gets costly in the area of physical exams for instance, but they still follow the same basic program that we do.
CE: You pay for the physicals for these miners?
RT: No, no. The contractor has to pay for his miner's
18

 RALPH
CE:
RT: CE: RT:
CE:
THUL # 1
physicals, so this runs into his own pocketbook which is not popular.
But the--it's required to give these people yearly physicals and X-rays?
Y es.
Then the---?--- of these people is studied too?
Yes. I think that our contractors operate as skillfully and definitely as safely as we do. Our divisional safety engineer had his son working for a contractor in a mine one summer. All of the people that are taken to do so-called ideal uranium mines are staked to a contract mine rather than a company mine, which seems a little ironic in a way. The contractors realize that their standards should be up to ours, and one of them usually wins the Small Mining Safety Award for the state of Colorado each year. So I think the company sets an example, sets a standard, and it's well followed by the people we
deal with.
Then I don't need to contradict you, because all I know is what I heard, and I'm confident that Union carbide places its emphasis upon this because these contractors have told me that. I understand that this is very expensive for them sometimes . For instance , if a miner has too many hours in the mine, when he's
19

 RALPH
THUL # 1
working for Union Carbide it may be feasible for him to work outside because he can be rotated with other miners. But these independent contractors really can't afford this. I've been told by one or two of them that they just can't do that, and that the only time they'll do it is when they are checked up on.
RT: Well this imposes a hardship on the company as well, because usually these top jobs are jobs that require a considerable amount of skill, which the average miner doesn't have. We do have the advantage of having some mines that have much lower levels than others. I'm only by hear-say or conversation really conversing about the mine relationship with the contractors, because within the mining department this is set up as sort of a separate division away from the company mines. We try to have safety meetings for them. Here again they have to pay for the men's time. It is one of the stumbling blocks you might say in implementing a good safety program, that so many people feel working safely takes time and costs money. But we try to point out that if you
prevent an accident you'11 actually end up saving time and saving money as well as being more thoughtful of the people that are working for you or that you're working with.
20

 RALPH THUL # 1
CE: We were discussing this afternoon some of the
independent contractors with whom I have talked, and one of them, Mr. Washburn, made a speech of which I have a copy in which he states that he feels very strongly that it isn't the radiation, that it's the smoking and radiation that creates the problem for miners. Do you think that that's true?
RT: There is a barrel of radon gas in the Colorado Bureau of Mines Office and you can put a counter in there and get no reading, but if you blow smoke into it, the smoke particles will pick up the gas so that you can get a reading. So this would indicate to me that the smoke picks up radon and carries it into the lungs which would not be carried in without some adhering particle. Another thing that happens now is that we have ventilation and we have more smoke breaks than they had in the early days of mining. It isn't unusual as your people will find when they talk to these old miners that they blasted and went right
back in when they could see all the way across the stove. This dust had to carry a lot of radon. There wasn't ventilation in the working space, so the levels were frequently as much as 1,000 times what they would be in a well-ventilated mine. Now just by the standards of dust control, not by the standards
21

 RALPH THUL # 1
of the radon control that we're trying to--
CE: We were talking about Dr. Jeno Sakamoto and the work he's been doing in conjunction with the Public Health Service and of course Union Carbide also. Would you like to comment about this work and how it influences your workers?
RT: Yes, I'm glad to. I think that Dr. Sakamoto is a real crusader, and I know he's probably spent a lot of his own money starting this. He has come to Uravan and shown slides with his own projector of what happens to your lungs when you do smoke and have radon exposure. I think somebody that makes this effort would really be called a crusader. He has gotten a number of people to stop smoking by convincing them that it is harmful to their health, especially when they're underground. We don't permit it in the mines and we try to get it as widely publicized as we can, even though the mill area is not a problem because of no radon, but smoking is harmful as such to such a
degree that quite a number of people because they are associated with other people who have quite make the effort. Sometimes it's real trying to the family.
CE: I'm sure it is. I didn't see many people in the mill smoking today.
RT: No. Most of the young people don't seem to smoke as 22

 RALPH
THUL # 1
much as they did before. I noticed this with our summer hires. I give each new employee an hour or so of orientation explaining to them what we do and what he needs to (do to] protect himself. During that time
if a man smokes he's usually had a couple of cigarettes. I'd say that we're far below the national average just on our new employees. I think part of it is that since they are active people they've got other things to do. Frequently smoking is a matter of something to do with your hands or--
CE: Habit.
RT: Well, it's definitely habit, but why the habit
starts.
CE: Will you explain why people shouldn't smoke around
that yellow cake dryer in the mill?
RT: Anytime that you smoke you are going to have a chance
of getting some of the yellow cake; it could be on your hands, on the cigarette, or the cigar, and also you're probably inhaling at a greater rate. The greatest harm that yellow cake can do in the body is by being ingested rather than breathing. Really when
you have an area like that and there's any question, the person that works there at any degree should have a respirator on too, and you just can't smoke with a respirator on.
23

 RALPH THUL # 1
CE: Not too well. Is that, there was no concern then with
those two fellows who were working with the wet
yellow cake?
RT: With the wet yellow cake there would be no concern.
They had their respirators there for working in the other area that they went into, but the bad point about him smoking, especially with his gloves on, was that cigarette was bound to have had some yellow cake some place that could be ingested. Had he been a regular employee in that area, I would have--well, I'11 still say something about it to his foreman. I'11 talk to him. Usually I try to go through his supervisor because we try to set the supervisor up as the main 1ine contact with these people, and he should have the respect of these people and also shouldn't be bypassed in any situation.
CE: Does that make you more popular too? I should think that you have a rather unpopular position as I mentioned before, because you are kind of guardian, and so people may not understand that you are as you say humanitarian and genuinely interested in these people and their survival.
RT: This is what makes safety a sales job in many respects, so that you sell them on the idea. They don't resent being told to do what is proper, even
24

 RALPH
THUL # 1
though they don't want to do it. If they understand why, they'll do it more readily. So this is part of communication and part of selling of safety, so that they will accept these things normally and not resent and reject them.
CE: You have a very good knowledge of the cities and the work that's done here, and if you don't mind I would like to ask you some questions about the community and community planning and the housing.
[Interruption] What is the cost of the housing to employees?
RT: We have some houses that rent for as little as $16 a month I believe. These are houses that actually started out as tent floors and then had walls ratted to (them to] make a one-room affair. Some of them are now as large as three bedroom houses. $16.50 is the lowest rent that we charge now. When we put in a
water heater so as to pay for that, then we raised the rent all the way to $17.50. The most expensive that I'm aware of right now I think is $48 a month. Now unfortunately we don't have natural gas piped into the housing, so our gas bills are a little
higher than the average, but--
CE: Where does the gas come from?
RT: They have bottled gas brought in large tanks that
25

 RALPH THUL # 1
serve each block and goes through a meter. But it's not natural gas and is more expensive. Some smaller houses will cost as much as $25 a month to heat, whereas with natural gas it probably would be 10 or 15 dollars at the most.
Talk about the other utilities.
CE:
RT: Well, of course, water and irrigation water in
unlimited quantity is furnished by the company. Our electrical power rate is about average for the United States.
CE: R.E.A.?
RT: R.E.A., yes. As you've seen, our service is
interrupted probably a dozen times during the summertimes because the power lines that come in here come across the top of the canyon walls and are subject to being hit by lightning. The power outages pose a problem particularly in the mill, but the people are frequently late to work if this happens at night, and all their clocks are electric clocks too. Another problem that we have sometimes in communicating, and this happened to my wife because a child was late for school--was that the Navajos didn't understand the Daylight Savings Time and didn't set their clock right, and she went over to this house where the Navajos live, which incidentally
26

 RALPH

was very clean. She had so much trouble that she
finally just went over and set their clock for them. It happened that he was on swing shift and he was ready to go to work whenever the fellow that gave him a ride came by, and he didn't pay any attention to time.
CE: It might be important to state right now that your wife is a schoolteacher.
RT: Yes, she had this kindergarten child that was just exactly an hour late for a day or two, and finally decided that they didn't have their clock set right and they didn't have any other children in school. So it was quite an interesting experience for her. I mentioned that the house was quite clean. We had some women in this area that wouldn't put their wash out on the line the same time that some of the Navajos do, because the Navajos' wash always looked much cleaner than theirs. One of them, and it's quite rare that they have a white pickup, but one of them had a
white pickup, and I'm sure they washed it twice a
week, always spotless.
CE: Where do the Navajos live?
RT: The Navajos that work in the local mines live in the
company housing here in town, but for our mine down in the Egnar/Dove Creek area, quite a number of them
27

 RALPH THUL # 1
have a community all their own of shacks behind the mine.
CE: I'm sure you are familiar with the reiations in the school between the Caucasians and the ~ndians. Would you like to comment on that?
RT: I think that's one of the advantages of a community of this type. The children grow up together and they don't realize there is a difference. I had to chase some young school age children out of our scrap yard a quarter of the way up the hill. Three of them were Navajos and two of them were white boys and they were just as happy as could be playing together.
CE: What about a language problem?
RT: If they have lived in this area for some time, there
isn't really too much of a language barrier. Where we have a problem is at the kindergarten level. A lot of them haven't heard very much English, and a lot of them have lived on the reservation. If they go to school on the reservation they learn English, but they are not usually as far along as our public schools are. Another thing that's most unusual, and one reason that we don't have very many Navajos in the mill is that one of the requirements is a high school diploma or its equivalency, and we also give a mechanical aptitude test because we have to have
28

 RALPH THUL #1
people--you saw the summer hire that had to be able to learn the job in three days and then take it over
for a man that was going on vacation. We don't ever expect to have a man come in and work just as a laborer. He's always expected to be able to go out into any department and learn the job in three days and be able to perform that job. This is important, especially for the younger people, because they have to have something that says, "I've just got to have a
job. I'd be glad just to dig ditches all the rest of my life here." This isn't very realistic. The Navajos have a very small percentage of their people that complete high school. But if they do complete high school they usually do well in the things that they do. The boy that we sat next to at the boarding house, I mentioned that he had a year of college, and I'm hoping that we will go ahead and complete an engineering degree. We had two boys that applied several summers ago and we didn't have any jobs at that time. But they had taken some drafting courses and their work was beautiful. Some of the penmanship that these Navajo men have is the most beautiful
writing in the world.
CE: What do you know about this boy? Tell me about his
background and where he went to school. 29

 RALPH THUL # 1
RT: Well, he went to school on the reservation, but I
think he also went to a public high school in New Mexico. I'm not real sure. Then he went to Fort Lewis, at Durango for a full year, and as with many people his funds ran short. He started working, and once he was working he decided he needed a pickup and plans--! think he will go back this fall. He's worked a full year now, and this summer will round out two summers, and I'm sure he's saved some so that he will be able to go to school.
CE: Can we go back to the community planning and housing? Are the houses modern generally?
RT: Yes, most of the older houses just have rough floors and some of them aren't insulated. But all the more recently built houses are well-insulated with hardwood floors, and some of them have had a fourth bedroom added for large families. The houses are adequate. Many people would like a fireplace or something of this type to make the house different.
At one time every house had to have the same color roof. This has been varied. Some of the houses, in the blocks that are frame houses, have been painted different colors to give it some variety. The company paints the exterior of the house and they provide enough paint to paint the interior about every year
30

 RALPH
THUL # 1
or two. They don't paint the interior as they do on some government installations. The one problem is that people sometimes come up with quite unusual combinations that are hard to cover. We try to hold
all our paints to pastel for this reason. One house next door to us at one time had one purple and three green walls, and the one two doors down had a kitchen ceiling that was black, just stove black. I didn't notice this until I'd been in the house two or three times, after somebody had told me this, because every time I went in the house it was a plumbing problem and I wasn't thinking about the ceiling.
CE: Are you a plumber too?
RT: No, I fill in as the personnel manager when he's on
vacation or out of town, and housing is one of his--I
don't thiP-k it would be wrong to say--headaches. CE: Sure.
RT: The things that seem very important to people such as a door latch that isn't working or a dripping faucet, when they're repeated over and over, time after time, become rather monotonous and they're things that you know are going to happen. Some people will take care
of their house just as if it were their own. But we have the extreme example where one lady would call if her doorknob was loose, expecting a carpenter to come
31

 RALPH THUL #1
over and take care of that. Many women in town would do it themselves not even expecting their husbands to do it. We had one woman that built her own shed and it's beautiful. This shows up too in our community efforts. We started a park at different times and people worked together to make swing sets and this type of thing, but they're not maintained or appreciated. Where a town is maintained by the company, people take the attitude that everything should be done for them. Not all of the people, but a portion of the people will have this attitude.
CE: Do you think that most of them do?
RT: No. I think this is a minority most definitely. For
instance we have--and this is a thing that in other cities is becoming quite a problem and has become a problem for us, in that we had to get better maintenance up. We have garbage pickup twice a week. This certainly makes it a more desireable place to live than having---?--- serve for quite a long time. But we have to put this in a pit and cover it over and we have to be sure that no water from that pit can get to the river to contaminate it. We contract the garbage to be hauled, and the man has a regular
garbage collecting truck, but we provided the pit. People will haul their own trash and limbs to that
32

 RALPH THUL #1
pit. As you probably noticed all through this part of the country, quite a number have pickup trucks and will do their own things like this. But again we'll have people though that will call in and say, "Hey,
I've got a load of limbs over here. How about picking it up for me?"
Do you have someone who will do that?
CE:
RT: We do this, yes. We have people. As a matter of fact,
this summer we have two boys that are spending their entire summer work in the housing area. They sprayed the elm trees for beetles twice and they're cutting out all of the elms that are growing wild and beetles stay on them and are hard to get to. They keep the houses that aren't occupied, the bunkhouse, and the hospital. We maintain the hospital facility. We keep those yards watered and mowed. We have to irrigate our lawns, and this is a full-time job for a couple of days. These fellows have a full summer's job just working in the housing. At one time we had a man who did this. He even pruned trees. We also maintain the baseball park. We have to mow that out there. We have picnic facilities there and we dump those garbage cans and clean up the pop bottles and things after
the softball games. The ball park is probably used four nights a week during the summertime. The pool
33

 RALPH THUL # 1
has a standard summer membership for children of a dollar and a half, adults $3, single swim is 15 cents or a quarter for adults. The lifeguard is well trained, and our safety standards there are quite good. It's a well-controlled chlorinated pool that will compete with any in the country. It's an Olympic size type pool. It can have swimming meets, has standard boards, three meter diving boards.
All company maintained again?
CE:
RT: Yes. It's run by the--and there is a concession stand
there, just like the drugstore, the filling station, and the tavern are run by a contractor in the boarding house, but the same contractor runs the pool. But the company does all of the maintenance that's required. They keep it clean and this type of thing, but we for instance fill the sand filter, change the chlorine models and this type of thing.
CE: Going back to the houses, what type of construction is most common? Brick, wood--?
RT: All of the houses are wood. This varies from almost like cardboard, seletex being nailed directly into the two by fours and some type of interior like
plywood on the inside and rough log facing on the outside to asbestos shape covering on some of the houses. One group of the houses is a standard two
34

 RALPH THUL #1
bedroom, prefab type built on a concrete slab which is not too desireable from the standpoint of women that have a tendency to get varicose veins, which airline stewardesses are quite prone to these days,
or should children get strep throat easier playing on colder concrete floors than they do normal wooden floors. None of them have basements as such, although several people have dug basements. All the larger houses are heated by gas. The smaller houses, some of the people have stokers and some kerosene, but the houses that rent for $16.50 for instance don't have any central heating. They're all heated by stoves. But the ones that have been built since '43 essentially are modern houses with central heating.
CE: Who qualifies for these houses?
RT: After a company employee has been here 2O days and
they are sure that he's going to be a permanent employee, he will be furnished with some type of housing. Now at one time we couldn't do this soon. Then naturally his family is going to grow and he will be assigned a larger house as the time with the company increases and his job responsibility increases. We have most of the people in adequate housing. At one time we didn't have enough three
bedroom houses for people that had boys and girls. 35

 RALPH
THUL # 1
We have added on to a number of these houses over the years so that there are quite a few more three bedroom houses, and there are several four bedroom houses. The more important your job is the more
likely that the house will be of better quality, although there is no reason not to find when we go through the houses that we'll have millhands living right next door to the metallurgist or the plant superintendent or something of this type.
CE: Do you think that these company dwellers represent a particular type of people?
RT: I don't think they do. I think they're about the same characteristic of the people that work in the mill that don't live in the company houses, as far as the type. They're just attracted here because there's a job here. One of the real advantages is that you don't build up an equity on a house until you're ready to retire. For instance, we have two people that retired this summer, and one of them tore down a
building so that he could build a house. And another
one--
CE: The company would let them do that here?
RT: No, he didn't built it here, he built it in Montrose
where he's retiring. The second one is renting a house. Part of the past advantage of having low
36

 RALPH
THUL # 1
retirement income was that you probabJ.y would have you house paid for at this time and have rent written off as far as an expense is concerned. Another thing is that the longer you stay here, the more costly it's going to be to try to buy a house. In other words, a house that was $2o,000 ten years ago is already forty-five now. The other thing that happens is that the people will take the money that is saved from rent and buy a car or--
Travel Europe as you have. How many times?
Well, I wasn't going to put that on the record. But I think people will justify what they want to do really.
What's important to them.
What's important to them.
Rent, lease, what do you do.
I guess I would say that as long as you have a job here in Uravan with the company that you've got a lease. There's nothing particularly signed. I've handled dozens of these and I don't even know what I've signed to say--that I'll take reasonable care of
CE: RT:
CE: RT: CE: RT:
the house and this sort of thing. But I think you don't get as good care on the average of a house the company owns that you do that even if somebody was renting it from another individual, because they look
37

 RALPH
THUL # 1
at the company as a big rich uncle, and he should do things for you and we haven't over the years, even though the housing costs have gone up, haven't ever raised any of the rent since the first costs were established. Which really isn't realistic, but it's a form of employee relations, and to raise everybody's rent would be quite disturbing. So it isn't done.
CE: You mentioned a library and some library services earlier.
RT: We have a number of people that utilize the library quite effectively, and we have for the town a very good and continually expanding library which is usually open about 3 evenings or afternoons of the week. This is independent of the school library. Then the bookmobile comes in every two weeks. It has quite a variety of books. Then either the bookmobile or we can write to the Grand Junction library and get any specific book that you want. The variety in the library is very good all the way from technical to
good fiction. The library board makes an effort each month to bring in a special group of books, whether it be on bottle hunting or some craft or something of this type in addition to the books that they have readily available. They make up a display about this to get people interested. Incidentally, that's one of
38

 RALPH
THUL # 1
the hobbies in the area, bottle hunting, digging up old dumps and finding bottles that have changed color or bottles that have been made in a mold of one or two parts or made in a wooden mold. And of course, rock collecting, arrowhead hunting, and just the plain game hunting and fishing and shooting. We've got several expert riflemen in the area. There is on the opposite side of the building which houses the
library, which is our recreation hall, a target range for shooting. The recreation hall has the two 35mm projectors set up so that it can show a continuous film just as a regular movie. We use these at Christmas time and usually have a Christmas party where we give out a bag of mixed candy, nuts, and a little toy and have Santa Claus for the younger children. Too many of them recognized me the year I did it. We usually have Laurel and Hardy or a Lassie movie or something of this type. At one time we did this in the Slickrock area, carted everything down there. But now we just give them a larger basket and
don't have a regular family movie.
CE: There are definite boundaries noticeable here, aren't
there? This is a canyon in which this town is set.
RT: Yes. We have room for a little bit of expansion possibly in adding houses, if it should ever need to
39

 RALPH
THUL # 1
be done, although it probably wouldn't need to be, closer to the river, farther out toward the high branch. The early pictures showed a large portion of the housing area as ranch land, and we've just gradually encroached upon that. For instance, for the swimming pool and the trailer court below it, when I came here it was an alfalfa field. The Club Ranch was somewhat productive at that time.
CE: As a ranch.
RT: As a ranch. We raised some hay and maintained the
orchard, and as a part of the contract, the mill pumped water out there for them to use to keep their crops growing. We used the same line to lay our pipeline in to carry the effluent out to the Club Ranch. We put one pond up above the existing ranch house to see if these ponds were going to work and really hoped that a number of us didn't have to take the ranch, because I think Lavender wrote the book while he was living there or these portions of it and this gave, I suppose, some nostalgic feeling about losing it.
CE: You're talking about One Man's West now.
RT: Yes. The thing that has been done mostly in recent years has been more notoriety than good history as
far as anything that has been written about Uravan. 40

 RALPH THUL # 1
So we certainly welcome anything that we develop from this type of a--I'd say a really concentrated study.
CE: The flat tops. I told you I talked -with Germaine Steele who grew up here, and she mentioned having lived in a flat top. This was the first place she lived. These are apartments.
RT: There are 5 to 7 units only divided by a normal wall, so it was difficult to conceal any arguments from your neighbors.
CE: They're no longer in use?
RT: They are used to a limited degree now. Some of them
are being torn down. Before they were torn down a number of them had been converted so that there were no single bedrooms; some of them have very nice living rooms and some of them were really beautifully done. Ruth Quackenbush's sister, Iza Carpenter had one that was one of the nicest homes in town. One of the other fellows put up an 8' board fence around his limited yard and had quite a bit of privacy. This was nice. Flat tops have such a high turnover because they're not a desireable place and they are higher rent because we furnish stoves and water heaters and everything and they're crowded, so they're costly to maintain and they weren't needed. In the days when
that was the only housing available it wasn't too 41

 RALPH THUL # 1
desireable because you had your neighbors right up on the other side of each wall from you in most cases.
CE:
RT:
[whistle]
I'm sure this is getting onto the tape, and I think it would be nice if you explained what that whistle's about.
When the whistle blows three times as you can well see from the tape recorder, we're out of power. The whistle that just sounded indicates that power has been restored and has been restored long enough that they can start starting up equipment in the mill. If they were to put in all on the line at one time or if the power came on real quickly and they didn't have a lot of it turned off, that would blow all the fuses.
Again it has to be started up a little bit at a time. CE: Who's responsible for fixing it? Company employees? RT: No, the power outages that are occurring now are due
to electrical storms between us and the generator
station, and the R.E.A. is out there.
CE: You have a boardinghouse for men who don't have
families here, or bunk houses.
RT: Yes, they are some just two beds and a chiffonnier.
Then we have one where a number of people have lived and worked here for quite a few years have one that's quite nicely fixed up. Most of the ones where they
42

 RALPH THUL #1
just have the two beds and a chiffonnier are for contractors or people that are here for a short time in the summer. The ones that are here on a more permanent basis have more or less a staff house as we call it, fixed up. Also we have quite a number of our mining people that live in Grand Junction. They have rooms over here in the staff house. Then we have a guest house; for instance, when the doctor came and his wife wasn't here he stayed there. We have-- somebody like Bob Beverly would be down here for two or three days; he would stay overnight at the guest house. We don't have any motel or hotel closer than seventeen miles away. So the guest house is sort of a necessary thing for the company. Also this happened quite often when we had people coming out from Oak Ridge. The furniture wouldn't be here for ten or twelve days and they would live in the guest houses. We 1ived there for one night while we were getting settled, when we came.
CE: Is there a community spirit, do you think?
RT: I think that as far as athletics is concerned there's certainly definitely a community spirit. I think it carries through. We have more boys on the football team for instance and the basketball teams than the percentage of Uravan students in the high school
43

 RALPH THUL #1
would represent.
CE: They go to high school at Nucla, don't they?
RT: They go to high school at Nucla. They go to junior
high school now for the last three or four years,
seventh, eighth, and ninth grade at Naturita.
CE: Oh, I didn't know that.
RT: This has just been in the last few years. For
instance the twirling girls were with the exception of one girl all from Uravan several years ago. I counted one of the plays where there were twelve people in the play. Seven of them were from Uravan. This is probably less than a third of the total high school population. There's a big disadvantage in that anything that has to be done after hours means that the kids have to drive back up there. The same thing is true of Paradox which is out--although it's a small community, it's out way from high school and their people have to go over there. Before the road to Paradox was paved it wasn't unusual for the people to board their children in town so that they could go to high school, rather than try to get them back and forth, up and down that road. The school system from the beginning through high school I think is quite adequate. I know even students from Grand Junction when they go to college don't have as much math
44

 RALPH
THUL # 1
background as they should have in some cases. We don't have calculus, for instance, in our high school, which is very desireable in this day and age. But most of the boys go ahead and catch up, and we have one boy across the street from us that has gone back to the Naval Academy for the second year. We have one boy that completed school here that was in
the first graduating class at the Air Force Academy. The mill foreman's son just recently graduated from the Missouri School of Mines and is working for the company in one of its Eastern Plants. So they do get a good enough background that they are prepared and equipped to go to. I would say these examples [rival] any schools in the country. As a matter of fact, we have one boy at Berkeley who finished and graduated this year. So they're equipped when they finish the school system to compete and place academically.
CE: How much influence do you think the company has over the schools?
RT: we usually have somebody from the company on the school board. I wasn't because my wife was a teacher. we loan them equipment. They use our ball park because it's better than theirs. We, I think, have a subtle influence rather than anything that we
specifically demand. The school board pretty well 45

 RALPH THUL #1
sets up what type of program they're going to have. We really don't have too much to say about it other than through our representative or things that we might suggest, but they aren't influenced by the company unduly, I am quite sure. We did have a flickering of community interest when they were going to hoist a very unpopular principal upon us a number of years ago. Dr. Ollenwood was starting to light his pipe and he was real excited about it anyhow, and he flipped his match and the head of it flew off. Somebody said, "Better to lose the head of the match than to lose your head in the argument."
CE: He was on the school board then, wasn't he?
RT: He had just been taken off of it. They had a reorganization. So at that time they had a school
board for this little school and for Nucla, Naturita. Now this is the West End, and Paradox, Nucla, Naturita and Uravan are all part of the same school system.
CE: Do you think the company recognizes the need for a good education?
RT: I am certainly sure they do, because of the number of people that they bring into this area for interviews and for jobs. This is certainly something that's important to people when they have a family, and most
46

 RALPH
CE:

THUL # 1
of them do.
Are many of your staff people professional people who require--?
There are professional people, and a number of them have wives who teach also.
Do these often end up being the teachers at the school? These wives I mean.
They usually do if they want to teach, yes, because there are always a couple of vacancies every year at the beginning of school.
How many teachers are there at the eight, seven-- what, six grades now?
There are six grades here now. I think there are six teachers and a principal. Then they bring in a--they have a couple of teachers' aides for a couple of classes that are large. They have a special education teacher, and I think a special education assistant and a music teacher that comes in.
Special education meaning?
For children that are lagging behind the other so far in their classes that they're not able to get anything out of it.
You imply then that the schools are the center of
CE: RT:
CE:
RT:
community life?
Only to the degree that the people here are oriented
47

 RALPH THUL #1
towards sports. They do have a lot of effect on community life. I think there're bowling. This forms a sort of a group. And I think there's a Pinochle club and various bridge clubs and this type of thing. One time we had duplicate bridge here every Friday night.
CE: How is that associated at the school now?
RT: Well, now that isn't associated with the school. I'm saying that I don't think the school_ is the main center. I think it's a passing center, although we had better attendance at the Uravan P.T.A. up in the last few years than any of the other schools. People were active in this area, but I don't think it's a
real big center of community life.
CE: What percent tax does the company pay to the county?
Do you have any idea?
RT: I don't know, and at the time we were putting up our
program at the county fair they were not inclined to show this, because they felt like it was maybe a show of power or something of this type. I don't think it was necessarily a secret, but I think they didn't want to have people feel that the company was a real
big contractor.
CE: But they did donate the land on which the school was
built.
48

 RALPH THUL # 1 RT: Y es.
CE:
RT: CE: RT: CE: RT:
And the school district then built the school. Is that right?
Y es.
In what school district is it? What's the name of it? R.E.2.
R.E.2?
R.E. for reorganized, I think, or something. They reorganized a number of the school districts in Colorado some time ago, and it makes sense from a human standpoint for instance to have this central office for high schools. They all run their own cafeteria, and this mean that they get government surplus food and then of course buy things at institutional lots. Gallon sizes and this. Just this year they started offering breakfast so that they could be sure that every child would have breakfast. Was this federally funded in some way?
This wasn't to my knowledge, although it could have been. They charged them I think a nickel or dime for
breakfast. What happened usually was that the children had breakfast at home and then went to school and ate for the novelty of it.
CE: RT:
CE: So they discontinued it?
RT: I think it will be permanently installed next year.
49

 RALPH THUL # 1
CE: You mentioned recruiting teachers. From where are
they recruited, other than the wives of employees? RT: The principal or the superintendent puts out adds I think in various--for instance, we had to recruit a district superintendent, and he came from New Mexico, so I'm sure that it's done through professional contacts. The teachers ' (are J the same, because a number of them have come up from Oklahoma and areas
like that. Our pay at one time was considerably above the average of the state, and the state ranks quite high.
CE: Would that be because this is an isolated area and it would make it more attractive?
RT: Yes. I'm sure that this was the reason it had to be done that way. You find that it isn't going to be very attractive to a young teacher just out of school if she doesn't have relatives right in the community, because there just isn't anything for young people to do.
CE: Do you attract young people, or generally are your teachers older people?
RT: Most of the teachers for this reason are older. We have had a few young people come in. But even in Nucla, Naturita, which is more this, the young people usually don't stay too long unless the--well, if
50

 RALPH THUL # 1
they're married, then this is fine. But to come here as single status, which is the case with most younger schoolteachers, it isn't very attractive.
But you don't question the qualifications of these people?
No, because we've got a selection, and they adhere to the level that is set by the state. In other words, the teacher has to renew her certificate I think every five years. To do this requires nine hours of
CE:
RT:
CE: RT:
CE: RT:
summer school during this five years. Also they have professional steps set up so that after you get your master's even you could go a little beyond that, but basically it is the breakdown between the ordinary degree and the master's.
Who provides the school employees housing?
We do that. We have--I should have mentioned that when we were talking about who 1ives in town. The school teachers live in the better houses in town. Better houses mean 30 or 40 dollars?
Yes. The school district owns one house which I think is where the ---?--- lived at one time out on the other end of town, and they have somebody from the high school live here too so that they can drive the bus from here every morning to take the high school students up, and that is usually a coach who brings
51

 RALPH THUL #1
the late bus back so that the boys that are out for sports have transportation. Which is one of the peeves that we have that we spend hundreds of dollars bussing for sports and debate and National Honor Society and clubs like this have to get along as best they can.
CE: That's been an inadequacy that people have coped with for a long time.
RT: Yes, but it seems more predominant here because people are so sports oriented.
CE: Do you think most of the children when they're grown do go on to a trade school or college, or do many of them go into the mines?
RT: I think that we're probably above the national average in the number that go on to higher education of some type. The main big reason being that there is limited employment in the area, and if they're going to pursue anything that requires technical training such as electronics if this is their interest, they will have to leave the area. They leave to get the training and usually don't come back, but a large
percentage of them do find ways to get.back.
CE: Many of these miners are transient, aren't they? They don't stay here for twenty years so that their children go through the entire school system, for
52

 RALPH THUL # 1 instance.
RT: We're getting more stability in our miners than the average community will have, I think. We never have had the number of so-called boomers that they have in hard rock mines. Partly because they screen them out. Most of the time we've been able to get experienced miners. You can look at the work history of a man and you can say, "Well, he's not going to be here long." Our mine turnover is higher than in the mill and our mill is higher than we'd like to see it. But here again part of the problem is the isolation of the community. If a man has a family and the whole family
isn't happy here, then he isn't going to be doing you
a good job anyhow.
CE: You said you hadn't been on the school board. Is
there an individual with whom I might be talking in
the next day or so who has been?
RT: You could talk to Ed Pennick who is the school board
member from Uravan. He's our chief geologist and he'11 probably be in my office or available just about anytime.
CE: Good. Regarding racial problems, you mentioned that there are quite a few Navajo Indians who are employed by contract miners and by the company. Do you think that racial problems exist?

I don't think they do other than the lack of communication. If the Navajo doesn't speak English or doesn't let you know he speaks English. Sometimes this can be a safety problem in the mine, but most of them will work with somebody that does speak well enough, and they know when you mean business and they frequently understand you when they don't let you know that they understand you. So I think there's no friction between any minority group and a so-called

majority group.
You have more Navajos than you do for instance Mexican-Americans?
In the Uravan area I don't think we do. Definitely in the Slickrock or in the Egnar area they have many more Navajos than they do Mexican-Americans.
Is there racial segregation in this community?
No.
You mentioned earlier that the Navajos may live-- They live anywhere that the housing is available to them. The same with the Spanish-American speaking.
So the company didn't make any definite plans for racial separation.
They never did, no.
Do you know what proportion of employees are Mexicans
or Indians'?

I don't know exactly. I would estimate about, including the Egnar area, about 20 to 25 percent.
Is it?
Y es.
Mr. Jones would probably have that statistic, wouldn't he?
He would have the exact--
A ---?--- maybe.
Y eah.
And there's no segregation in the schools or school activities as far as you can determine?
No, definitely not. There never has been in the time that I've been here and I'm sure even before that.
Do people separate along national lines, or isn't that a problem as it would be in the East, for
instance?
I think the Spanish-American people tend to have more Spanish-American friends and the Navajos more Navajo friends than they do--but I think it's because of the ease of communication and feeling more comfortable in
their own peer groups rather than there being any feeling, and their interests are probably more nearly the same.
But they ultimately work together?
Yes, and I don't think that there's any

differentiation made as far as the job they do or that they' re assigned to. If they' re gualified they can be foreman or they can be mechanics or anything. So there's never been a breakdown that there's [in theJ South of certain jobs being only for a certain group or race of people.

CLARE ENGLE IS THE INTERVIEWER. (TAPE #1. THIS IS PART OF THE UTAH URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT.]
CE: Mr. Thul, would you like to talk about the pollution problems that a town such as Uravan has as a result of the mill and specific problems that are unique to Uravan?
RT:
Yes, I think so. The ponds that you saw as you came in at the edge of town are required if we're going to keep the river clean because of the high acid content, the salts and the radioactive materials that are in them. We don't have any way of treating this economically so we must impound it. This is all mill waste. The material that we can treat and make acceptable for dumping in the river goes into the river without any discoloration or any change. This type of material that we have out here has to be given a special treatment.
And those were built as a result of what?
Partly as a result of change in process where we were using more acid and we had more radioactive contaminants that were not cleaned up by any process that we knew of well enough to go into the river, so
we just looked at the various methods we could to
CE: RT:
contain it and built the ponds.
CE: Who brought your attention to this?

 RALPH THUL # 1
RT: Well, I think we were as well versed in the product
we had there as anybody, because we were following the metallurgy changing the circuit and we knew what the requirements were and what they would be. We do continuous sampling of up the river, down the river, and then of everything that goes into the river. So we know whether we're getting anything through our circuit that could be harmful to the water quality.
CE: You said today that you were taking some of this effluent to the mines hoping that you could bury it there?
RT: Yes. This was one of several methods that we experimented with and explored. We hoped that we would be able to put this into a mine and it would seep away harmlessly back into the earth. Another method that we considered and spent some money on the research was drilling a deep well, which some of the other companies have done. This is meeting some resistance in other areas. I think that we are
probably as well or better off that we didn't do this, although the life of these ponds of questionable. The maintenance on them is probably simpler than the well would have been.
CE: Well, why didn't it work in the caves?
RT: The sandstone wasn't as permeable as we though it
58

 RALPH THUL # 1
was, and acid liquor didn't actually work on the sandstone to the extent that it opened up any channels of any size. It just stayed there just like a cistern actually.
Have you had any problems with smoke from the mill?
CE:
RT: We probably will be exceeding some of the limits
occasionally. The real problem I see is that it would be to a little degree a nuisance and not in any way harmful, because we have so much air dilution and we don't have any other industry that's putting smoke into the air. There are actually two fields of thought on this: one being that the air moves all over and if it gets there from any source that it's bad, but the thing that I think is most important is that the air quality be such that the people are not harmed in any way by it. We know that there are times that we don't operate things so that they meet every strict standard, especially as they will be set up, but we do most of the time keep everything under well enough that it's acceptable.
CE: You were talking about planting plants or seeds on the tailings.
RT: Especially in areas where there is considerable wind erosion this is desireable. Even when the tailing pile is in use, but as you noticed on our tailings
59

 RALPH
THUL # 1
there isn't any wind erosion, at least not yet. It's got enough material in it that it cements itself on the outside firmly enough that it isn't a problem. But once the tailings piles are abandoned or the mill
is not in use, then they most definitely have to be
covered and have a seat cover on them.
CE: Is there a law regarding that?
RT: This is an A.C. requirement, yes. They are having
trouble in their own area where they tried this mill that was abandoned in Monticello I believe. Where rodents got in and exposed the tailings again. So you definitely helped the ecology of the area, but then you make it attractive to animals and sometimes have to redo it.
CE: How much are people really concerned about that here? About radiation for instance?
RT: Well, I think every one that is knowledgeable about radiation is concerned to the degree that we do not want to create any environment that is in any wise harmful to anybody. We want to keep the quality of the air that might be contaminated in any way as high as possible. I think we just have to figure this into the cost of operation over the years. Just as a coal
mine, when they have to remove their overburden, put it back now so that the beauty of the land isn't
60

 RALPH
THUL # 1
obscured. The tailings pile would be the same category as this. The real harm that is done is through adverse publicity and people making wild guesses. The tailings problem in Durango is the point that is brought up. This is not a Carbide property, but we're certainly always aware of what's going on
in related fields to related companies. It isn't a pretty sight to be downtown there; there are dust problems, but from the radiation standpoint a person would drown in dust before they could be harmed enough by radioactivity in the material itself. So this is not a logical approach. It's an emotional approach that people will buy. This is the type of thing that is easier to sell than to just covering it up for the aesthetic beauty.
CE: Shouldn't the companies then such as Union Carbide that has such an active safety program and has a man who is considered an authority in the field of radiation and pollution control do counter public relations work so that this type of publicity is countered?
RT: Well, I think when you're affiliated with a company who supposedly has an ax to grind in this area, public relations work would have to be very subtle to get people to accept it. The statement about the
61

 RALPH
THUL # 1
tailings was made by an independent radiologist whose history of experience with radiation and radiation control goes back to the days when women were getting radium on the tips of their tongue and got contaminated, so he has a wide experience. He is not industry oriented; he is an independent source of information. I think somebody like that will be believed much more quickly than somebody that's associated with a company that supposedly has an ax to grind. I think this is the big disadvantage you have with persons in the company, even though they are an authority at making statements and then getting them accepted.
CE: How much has the federal government imposed its standards into Uravan?
RT: Well, they have checked to see that we have what they call a reasonably adequate slope on dikes and we have containment of everything so that there won't be any sudden release of tailings, either sand or liquid to the river. They have had consultants from the A.E.C. look at these and try to draw partly with our experience guidelines in developing ponds, in
developing piles so that they will not in any way be able to escape to the river. Their experience has been gained from other companies as well, but we have
62

 RALPH THUL # 1
done quite a bit of work in cooperation with them to be sure that we have good reliable systems for containing all of our wastes.
CE: What improvements in general have been made regarding ecology in Uravan?
RT: On an abandoned ---?--- tailings pile, we have covered it and done some limited planting. There will be I think a national takeover of vegetation, especially when we have as much moisture as we've had lately. By controlling our processes, we do not currently release anything that can be harmful to any of the vegetation, so there is a natural restorative process going on all the time from the days when the salt was added to the ore and the salt formed a sort of hydrochloric acid in the air and killed some of the trees.
CE: You said today that the reason that these tailings for instance are not buried is because there might be a future use for the ore that's left in them.
RT: Some of the tailings as we know from years past have had this history in that they were able to be used again. currently we don't think that they will be used again. But we have no way of knowing.
CE: Applied to uranium didn't they--initially there was no thought that uranium would have any use?
63

 RALPH THUL # 1
RT: Yes, hundreds of tons of uranium bearing tailings
have gone down the river as a result of feeling that there was no future use for them. Whether there is actually something in the tailing now that in another century will become important, we realiy have no way of knowing.
CE: Mr. Thul, is there anything you would iike to add to conclude this interview in regard to your work specifically?
RT: Some of the things that you were asking about would indicate that we are led by the government to do some of the measures, and I suppose to a limited degree this is true. But basically most of our standards and the things that we want to accomplish are more far reaching that actual government requirements. We are genuinely concerned with the health of the people,
with the environment that they have, that they live in. We are constantly trying to find ways to improve this so that we do have a community that is enjoying a high standard of air quality, a high standard of water quality as we can insure at this level. I think that we will continue for years and years to work
along this line even though we are rather isolated, because it's hard to tell in another century what the population of this area could be and what the needs
64

 RALPH THUL # 1
for the high standards of water purity and air in the total environment might be.
CE: Well, I want to thank you very much for the very fine cooperation you've given me today and for the hospitality. I really appreciate it. I had a very nice introduction to Uravan as a result of that. I hope that we'll have an opportunity to talk again.
RT: Thank you, it's been very enjoyable on my part. I hope that I have thought of the things as they came up that were of interest, and I'm sure that there are some that I've overlooked. Perhaps you will be able to add those at a later date.
CE: Thank you.
RT: Y ou're most welcome. CE: We will--
