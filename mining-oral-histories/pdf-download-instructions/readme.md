# PDF Download Links

Due to size limitations, we were unable to upload all the PDFs for this collection, however, we have included a list of URLs that can be used to download mining oral history PDFs directly.
You can use your own method for bulk downloading items, or a handy resource like [the sourcecaster](https://datapraxis.github.io/sourcecaster/) for getting web-based items through a list.
