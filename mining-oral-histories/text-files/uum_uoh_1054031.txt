And some- how it went off the track and went down on its side, and that handle, the switch that controls that bucket, somehow it went off the track and push against the rock.

Three years ago the guy from Montrose--he's a good miner,too, a Mexican guy, and he went to start on that, so I come andshow it to him three times---?--- get together with it. Then I went up to Window Rock. They wouldn't let me do it.Not even with him, huh?JA: No.KB.: Huh. Well, that's kind of hurting the tribe in a way, isn't it?Because if you--if you could prove that there was ore there, thenother people--other Navajos are going to go and stake claims. JA: Sure.KB.: And bring in more jobs for them. Are you aware of all the revenue and royalties that the VCA has paid to the Tribal Council from themines that they own on the reservation? JA: Y eah, they pay them.KB.: You think that's a good thing?JA: Uh huh.KB.: Uh, what do they do with the money? JA: You mean the tribe?KB: Yeah.
