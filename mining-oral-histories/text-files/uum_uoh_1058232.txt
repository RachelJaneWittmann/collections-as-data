 THIS IS AN INTERVIEW WITH J . THOMAS GREENE, CONDUCTED BY MITCH HADDARD IN THE KENNECOTT BUILDING, SALT LAKE CITY , UTAH ON JULY 23, 1970 AT 2:30 P.M. THIS IS PART OF THE ORAL HISTORY PROJECT BEING DONE BY THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH A ND C A L I F O R N I A S T A T E A T F U L L E R T O N ON T H E U R A N I U M I N D U S T R YI N THE COLORADO PLA TEAU.MH: Mr. Greene, as I stated in the pre-interview, the first thing I'd like to know is a little bit about yourself.JG: Well, I suppose you want to know something about my professional career.MH: Right.JG: Well, I went to the University of Utah as anundergraduate, and I got a B.A. degree in 1952 in the summer. That was in political science. The last quarter I started to take law classes also. I graduated from the University of Utah Law School at the end of 1954 and took the bar just before I graduated by special permission and was admitted to practice the first part of 1955. I was on the Order of the Coifu, a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and graduated from undergraduate school with high honors. I got interested in mining law as a Law Review project. I was a member of the Law Review staff all during my time as a student of the law. I wrote two or three articles, but one of them was on mining law. It took me through a review of the public land law, regulations and law, and things of that nature. It was at a time when the uranium boom was just
 J . THOMAS GREENE #1 blossoming.MH: You practice now in Salt Lake and you've been in Salt Lake since you graduated from law school?JG: That's right. When I graduated, I became a clerk for Judge J. Alan Crocket of the Supreme Court. I was engaged at that up there for about a year, but I was practicing on the side. I practiced alone for about a year and a half. I solicited all the judges in the state to see if they would appoint me to criminal cases, and I guess I tried about a hundred criminaljury cases. I had a couple of murder defenses. I think I got a total of twenty dollars renumeration and a lot of experience. I went down to the United States Attorney's office in 1957. I was there a couple of years as assistant U.S. attorney. I had the criminal desk. I came back as a partner of the predecessor of this law firm in the first part of 1959, and I've been practicing privately as a partner in this firm ever since. I've been active in bar work. I'm president of the Utah Bar now. For the pastfive years I have been a Utah State Bar Commissioner. I was chairman of the Young Lawyers Section of the Utah State Bar. I am a member of the Council of the American Bar Association in a section on natural resources. I've been on that council for several2
 J . THOMAS GREENE #1 years.MH: Now, in your articles you go through a general synopsis of mining law, of what details are actually involved, more or less in the property aspects of mining law. In the end you give a summary conclusion of where up to 1954 you thought the uranium industry was going to go. Just out of curiosity, do you think it has gone according to your prediction?JG: Well, let's see, let's find out what I predicted. Can you state that?MH: I think you stated that the laws were definitely vague in many areas and that a revision was definitely needed, and due to the Multiple Use Act, things would be slightly easier. But you're also predicting a boom in the future for the industry of uranium.JG: Well, so far as the law is concerned, I think it's apparent that there has been a drastic reconsideration of the mining laws. The Public Land Law Review Commission has come forth recently with its report. I think, though, there has been a greatdesire to maintain the basic structure of the mining laws. So far as the uranium industry, there has been kind of a little flurry recently again in uranium work. I don't think it's dead by any means. I think3
 J . THOMAS GREENE #1as long as the government is involved in world affairs, we'll have a uranium industry, and they are a lot of domestic uses for uranium, too, so it's still alive.MH: When you said that there is a recent flurry, is this the concept of revitalizing the shell? Are large companies like Standard Oil or different oil companies getting interested in uranium as a mineral for exploitation?JG: Yes, I think not only in the securities field but in the actual mining field there has been a revitalization, re-look at old uranium mines. I'm aware of some that have become revitalized, another look at it, more actual mining.MH: Is the legal aspects of uranium mining easier now that the laws have been slightly straightened out? Mention has often been made of this Public Law 250; Public Law 589 I think is the other one, but--JG: Public Law 585.MH: Public Law 585. Have these served to expedite mattersin regard to uranium mining, claiming, et cetera?JG: Well, yes, because of the pre-existing conflict between oil leases and any mining claims, those laws were passed. I think they were passed, Public Law 250 particularly, as a stop-gap measure to make it4
 J . THOMAS GREENE #1possible to use the same land.MH: This is the Multiple Use Act, correct?JG: That was the predecessor of the Multiple Use Act,Public Law 250. The Multiple Use Act is 585. I think that has facilitated the presence of both uranium and oil people on the same land and made what used to be a legal jungle, pretty clear situation now.MH: I have some questions in regards to your article, if you don't mind. One, you mentioned in your article the aspect of penny stocks, or the presence of uranium stocks. Would you explain to me some of the legal problems that the rash of penny stocks caused.JG: Well, I don't think it's unique, that is, the uranium aspect is unique as compared with some other minimum issue type stock situations that have occurred from time to time in the history of this area and in the history of the country. Mining in general has always had penny stocks. Many states have a law that permits the floating of securities based upon property on anaffidavit of value that is set forth by the incorporators, and that's unique for mining as compared with other kinds of corporations. I thinkwhen you get stock issued on that kind of a basis, which was the case in a lot of the uranium issues, and then get it set at a low enough figure, there's a5
  J .THOMAS GREENE #1chance for a good deal of overreaching on the part of those who might be trying to sell the stock of distribute it, and things of that nature. Recently there has been a revival of some of these old shells under what appears to be a contrived or inflated market arrangement, resurrecting these old shells and making the prices go up many hundreds of times beyond what they ever were.MH: Do these shells still have to be under the auspices of a company or a business which has been sanctioned by the S. E. C.? They have to be val id stocks, don't they?JG: Well, yes. Of course, the S.E.C. would be strictly interstate commerce issues, and I presume that most of these are.MH: In the paper which you wrote, you stated that both you and a Mr. Kimball, I guess it was you stated that Utah's Securities Act violated due process. I remember you stated that it leaves a discrepancy regarding due process. This was in regard to these penny stocks. Could you explain to me how the law was vague in that area so that it didn't give a person the rights which they were guaranteed.JG: You're asking me to remember something that I'm really not sure about. I do remember that Ed Kimball,6
 J .THOMAS GREENE #1who is a professor now at Wisconsin--and incidentally he is in Salt Lake this summer studying. He and I together did a paper for the University of Utah Law School and it was on the Utah Securities Act. I believe that subsequent articles have been writtenabout that act. I can't remember the language but there were some provisions of it, it seemed to me that were very broad and vague. I believe that's what we were talking about on due process. There might have been other aspects, I'm thinking maybe of the rule--they had a couple of regulations that were not in the law that were rule-of-thumb things, which would say what a public offering was and how many people could become involved in obtaining stockwithout the Utah Securities Commission regarding that as something covered by the act.So it wasn't actually in the books?Right.It was just a rule of thumb?The difference between a private and a public offering became a matter of vagueness in terms of administrative handling. That might have been one of the things we were talking about. I think it was.I have several questions, general questions in regardto claiming and locating a claim. This is the aspect 7MH: JG: MH: JG:MH:
  J .THOMAS GREENE #1of the public domain versus the leased lands. Now this has been an area in which Utah and the federal law both are quire vague, correct? I mean they were confused for a long time until the Multiple Use Act came about. What were some of the legal problems in this area?W ell, I don't think that the M ultiple Use Act particularly cleared up how you stake a mining claim or what discovery is or those problems. All it did was to make more certain the status of lands upon which the claims were filed.JG:MH: So then basically the criteria for filing a claim is still the Utah Code itself--Section Forty of the Utah Code which states about markers having to be--JG: Yes. I don't remember the sections, but the basic mining law of 1872 which was a federal statute governs mining claims on the public domain, and then state statutes can refine that and add things to it. In Utah we have added some refinements to it. In some states there is a necessity for a discovery pit dug. That isn't true in Utah, but the markers anddiscovery monuments and things of that nature are set forth in Utah law. But I don't think there is a great deal of ambiguity on that, although there have been a lot of cases on the situations like having a8
 J . THOMAS GREENE #1discovery after you have filed your notice of location, and things of that nature.MH: But wasn't there also a lot of conflict? Utah law allows thirty days, correct? I mean, you stake your monument and everything, and you have thirty days. During those thirty days, weren't there many people who overclaim or overlapped claims? There were disputes in that legally, correct?JG: Well, I think there have been a lot of disputes that way. The theory of it is pretty plain, though, that if you have a valid discovery and if you put up your markers, you have thirty days which will relate back to the time that you posted your discovery notice on the claim. I don't know of a case that would go against that general principle of law.MH: Okay. I have also a question regarding when the A.E.C. came into the picture. This was a period when they were offering a guaranteed market, correct, for vanadium and uranium? They agreed to survey and drill claims for miners. Am I right in the assumption that the A.E.C. would drill the claims for the miner to find out, if there was a valid claim on it. Weren't there several legal problems involved in that? I'mthinking of the case of Rommel (?) versus Bailey (?), where there was a discrepancy over whether or not9
 J .THOMAS GREENE #1somebody actually come on your claim and drill it.JG: You mean the A. E. C. would come on a claim without permission?MH: JG:Yes, I don't know if this is--Well, I don't know. I"m not acquainted with what you're talking about directly, but I think there is a problem in initiating rights on a claim by trespass, whether or not those rights would be valid. There are several problems. But, of course, you are aware that there is a doctrine in mining law that permits you to actually trespass in order to complete your discovery monuments and make your markers in order to put up your posts.MH: I don't know. I'm not familiar with that now. You mean, they actually allow you to overlap into somebody else's claim so as to complete your marker? For marker purpose, yes, so thatá you'll have parallel end lines. For instance, in the matter of extralateral rights, if you have an irregular shaped claim and in order to establish yourself with parallel end lines, it becomes necessary to enter an adjacent claim in order to put up your marker; you'reJG:MH:permitted to do it for that purpose.Is this part of the legal dispute over whether or not they could actually establish an apex of a claim?10
 J . THOMAS GREENE #1JG: Well, it's part of the apex law, and in terms of whatdirection and how your extralateral rights or apex rights would be measured. Now uranium is interesting in regard to extralateral rights.MH: Because of its formation, you mean?JG: It is, of course, a lode-type deposit, and it hasbeen located sometimes as a placer. Of course, that's a substantial problem; whether you locate something as a placer or as a lode because if you guess wrong, you may have an invalid location. But it seems clear that all lode-type deposits do not have extralateral rights, and most uranium claims are blanket-type deposits. It has been argued in some of them that they are, they do carry extralateral rights. I don't think any case has every gone up to any Supreme Court on it though.MH: This is in the discrepancy over--for example, a lode claim is fifteen hundred by sixty by six hundred, correct? This allowed along the vein?JG: That's right.MH: Now what is the actual filing of a placer claim? It'snot the same type of boundaries, is it?JG: I'm trying to think. It is different in boundaries. MH: Are the claims basically the same size if it'sclaimed one as placer or as a lode? 11
 J . JG:THOMAS GREENE #1It seems to me that they are different. For some reason that I can't think of right now. But the difference is the character of the deposit. And when you say locate fifteen hundred by six hundred feet along the vein, what if there isn't a vein? What if it's just a blanket-type deposit like most uranium claims are? Is that a valid lode location? The law does speak of location along the vein. Well, the answer to that, I think, clearly is that it can be a valid lode location.MH: This brings to mind another question then, legally whether or not uranium is considered to be met alliferous?JG: I think it isn't.MH: You think that it isn't?JG: That's correct.MH: But is it handled under the law the same as a hard-rock mineral?JG: Yes, I think it usually is. But as I say, some of thepeople have located them as a placer. I think it has most often been located as a lode. And the law doesn't say that it needs to be metalliferous, does it?MH: No. There's just a fine line, you know, of 12
 J .THOMAS GREENE # 1controversy over whether or not it really is. Several people have questioned that fact, and this is what I was wondering. It seems like, as you stated again in an article, just remembering, that when the uranium boom more or less came, it became a prime resource; that many of the laws that dealt with mining or with uranium itself were antiquated. They weren't really ready to cope with the boom they had on their hands.JG: That's right. The main problem, as I see it, was first the conflict between oil and hard rock in terms of obtaining rights in the public domain; secondly, the fact that uranium didn't seem to fit exactly as either a lode or a placer; and thirdly, was the problem of discovery. When you discover uranium, it was done by geiger counters very often. Now, the mining law is written in such a way that it contemplates an actual outcropping of visible, discernible kind of deposit. It is within two walls, a hanging wall and a foot wall with a country rock,and the usual mining terms, and vein, and lodes, and that just isn't what we find with uranium. You find it in depths. You find it discovered by a geiger counter. Is that a valid discovery? Does that comply with the mining law? Mining law wasn't written contemplating this kind of a scientific type of13
  J .THOMAS GREENE #1discovery. So that became an immediate problem. Geiger counters were being sold all over the West, and everybody had one and that is truly the way they would get hot on a lead of something, and it didn't comply with the mining law. Then the form of the deposit wasn't quite right. I think this emergency legislation kind of solved the status of the land between the oil and the hard-rock conflict.MH: Isn't it true also that when the boom was on with these geiger counters and everything, there was really a fever around this area, uranium fever?JG: Oh yes.MH: Wasn't it also true that there were book out on howto claim your property and how to miner it and different things, and sometimes these book were wrong on their information?JG: Well, there are all kinds of weird book and publications out, and a lot of it was spurious, a lot of it was erroneous. One of them that I thought wasn't erroneous was the one they asked me to write at the University of Utah--I think it was the Department of Geology. I wrote them a little pamphlet on how to stake a uranium claim, and I summarized the law. That became one of their publication, and Ithink a few of those were sold--not too many. I think 14
 J .THOMAS GREENE #1one thing I said there--I remember very few things about that article that I wrote--but one thing, one footnote I do remember is where I indicated that uranium burger were being eaten with relish, and they were actually called uranium burgers. Everything was uranium oriented. There were stores and signs, and you just had to use that word. It was a magic word. It was fantastic. There were all kinds of underwritings and all kinds of stock issues with weird names. I remember one of them was Uranus and we used to say, "Up Uranus." That was speaking of the stock market, you see. There were other weird names, one of them was Copper Blossom. I don't know what that had to do with uranium, but--Moab King, Moab Queen. A lot of money changed hands, a lot of little investment clubs. I had one at the law school. I got several law professors involved in it, about ten of us. We called is Legales. That all it was, it was penny uranium stock. You'd put in ten dollars a month and buy these crazy penny uranium stocks.That was another really big problem: these fraudulent companies. That also goes along with the question that I asked about eh fraudulent books too. All of those presented legal problem. If they gave improper, erroneous information, they were subject to fraud,MH:15
 J . THOMAS GREENE #1 correct?JG: Oh sure, yes. I guess that's the philosophy of the Securities Act, that you can sell anything, as long as you tell the truth, make a full disclosure. There weren't full disclosures because they didn't know much, and there were some misleading things done, no doubt about it.MH: So this again goes back to that statement that really, when it all started, they were just caught flatflooted, as far as the law goes, dealing with uranium and a mining boom of this magnitude.JG: Yes, there had been mining stock boom of a penny nature, I believe, in the area before. I think the securities law was found to be wanting even then. But the real inadequacies of the laws that I had in mind were the mining laws, although there were deficiencies in the securities and the Blue Skies Laws, no doubt about that. I think one of theprofessors at the U. wrote a Law Review article on the inadequacies of the Utah Securities Act shortly after this occurred, and it was a follow-up to what Kimball and I did. I believe it was Wally Bennett, as a matter of fact.MH: Professor Bennett?JG: Yes. And my recollection is that there were some16
 J . THOMAS GREENE #1substantial changes made in the Securities Act. Of course, what Kimball and I did was strictly the work of a couple of students and it was just a ripple in the steam at the time.MH: My next question goes farther on. There came a large section of legal activity dealing with anti-trust. This was in the vanadium era when the two companies, V.C.A. and Union Carbide, controlled most of the industry. But then after that, after cases were brought against them, a lot of legislation took place, I guess, save-face-type legislation or however it might be termed. I was wondering if the uranium laws today are fairly clear cut or are there stillvery gray areas dealing with uranium law?JG: When you say uranium law, I'm not sure.MH: Or mining law, I guess I should have said.JG: The same problems of still telling what a discoveryis; the distinction between lode and placer still exists. There is another problem of real substance that I have written about in a couple of subsequent articles in mining journals, and that is dower rights. I'm sure that you understand that an unpatented mining claim has been heralded by the Supreme Court of the United States as property in the fullest sense of that term. It's something that you17
  J .THOMAS GREENE #1can devise and bequeath. It's something you can convey, something that can be inherited. It's something that can be owned. It's subject to being defeasance if you don't keep up your assessment work. But, having those characteristics, are dower rights attached to it. Now the Supreme Court of the United States in a case called Black versus Alcorn, as I remember, said no, but the Utah dower statute is broad, and yet I'm of the opinion that a wife does have a dower right in a mining claim, in unpatented mining claim. That could screw up a lot of mining titled and cause a whole lot of problems if it's right. It's a theory of mine. I haven't ever seen it tested out, but it could vary from state to state,depending on what the state statute say on dowerrights.MH: It could be tested then? I mean legally there isstill a lot of area where a case could be brought inconcerning dower rights?JG: Why, yes. I sure think so. You bet. And that u.s.Supreme Court case came up from Montana, as I remember it, which has a little different wording in its statute. But dower rights is an interesting problem that is related peculiarly to the nature ofmining claims of unpatented mining claims. 18
 J . MH:THOMAS GREENE #1Now this aspect of patenting a mining claim, I have a question about that. When a man is seeking a patent to a claim, he must first clear up all previous claims or all contests that come to that claim before he can achieve his patent? Is that right? Everything has to be cleared up in a pre-hearing type ofsituation before he could receive a patent for hisclaim?JG: Well, that's right. He files his application forpatent and then that creates not only a necessity to clear up any adverse claims that might be asserted by other mining claimants, but it initiates an investigation by the Department of the Interior into the validity of that claim. So if you're not sure about your discovery, for instance, and you file an application for a patent, it might result in an invalidation of your mining claim. And it might result in an investigation as to the adequacy of themarking and the bona fideness of the whole situation. MH: So in a way, you're kind of taking a chance when youfile a patent? If you claim's not really legitimate? JG: Well, that's right. And then, of course, if you do get your patent, you feel you've taken away the ultimate title of the government, so there is a good reason to do it. There has been some recent cases19
  J .THOMAS GREENE #1that seem to go in the other direction in terms of what an unpatented mining claim is, emphasizing the rights of the government and de-emphasizing the right of the locator, while the early U.S. Supreme Court cases didn't really make a distinction in character between an unpatented mining claim and other property rights. But there were a couple of recent cases thatI think have been decreed by Howard (?) Grey, for instance, a mining lawyer in Nevada, and some other in recent publications as being sort of a step backward from the dignity of mining location.Which cases are these that you're referring to? Do you remember a decision then?I've written about them in the Title Six of American Mining Law. I've got several notes detailing these cases.So then this case that you're looking up, this is a recent case, correct?Yes. There are a couple of cases that I'm thinking of. One of them is the Coleman case. Maybe you'veheard of that.The Coleman case? No, I'm not familiar with it.MH:JG:MH:JG:MH:JG: It's one that got a lot of people in the miningindustry all shook up.MH: But did it deal with location and rights?20
 J . JG:MH: JG:THOMAS GREENE #1Coleman versus the United States. I'm just looking at the Ninth Circuit note on it. But I know that it went up to the Supreme Court of the United States.Is it Coleman versus the United States.Coleman versus the United states. Another one was the Best case, I believe. Best versus Humble Placer Mining Company. That was a 1963 case, 371 U.S. 334.It held the administrative determination of the validity of mining claims as appropriate, an administrative ruling.So it gave the government it was a ruling toward the federal government rather than toward the individual miner?Yes, and the Coleman case, The United States versus Colemanr looks like that's 390 U.S. 599. That's 1968. That had to do with the marketability standard, with reference to the validity of unpatented mining claims as distinguished from the Prudent Man Test. So it seemed to be enunciating the different rules relative to discovery and validity of discovery.So a change in trend then is what you're getting at? Y es.Theses are two cases which turn around, more or less, everything which they started before?MH:JG:MH: JG: MH:JG: Yes, this is a definite trend. 21
 J . MH:JG:THOMAS GREENE #1Couldn't that really mess up the legal aspects of mining law if the trends of the court turn around and favor big business and government again?Well, I think it's a definite step back and away from a small mining operation and particularly small mining locators who want to say that anything that a prudent man would do as to how a discovery should be regarded. The strict holding of that case applies to quartzite stone which the Secretary of the Interior had found could not be marketed at a profit. And there it becomes a distinction between metallic and non-metallic minerals. I though maybe that's what you were getting at when you said metalliferous as it applied to the marketability test, for determining the validity of discovery.Uranium is not considered metalliferous, is it, on marketability?No, I don't think so.Now when I was saying metalliferous, I was stating-- Speaking of uranium particularly?MH:JG:MH:JG:MH: Right. I was thinking also in terms of--in earlieryears wasn't uranium classified as a hard-rock mineral, more or less? You know, in a similar category with gold, silver, copper other types under the law?22
 J . JG:MH:THOMAS GREENE #1I don't know what law actually categorizes any minerals into those categories, but I think it was popularly regarded that way.The question I had was in regard to the Multiple Use Act. Was there a legal flurry or legal dispute over-- if you had a claim that, say, you filed a uranium claim, and a great store of oil or shale or some other mineral was discovered on it, would your claim still be valid even if you filed for uranium? It would be now, wouldn't it still be valid even if you filed for uranium? It would be now wouldn't it under the Multiple Use Act, but would it have been earlier? If I understand your question, it would be valid now because of the Multiple Use ACt.Right. But before the act, it would not have beenvalid, correct?That's right.This is an area that was extremely confusing to me when I researched it.On year. When the 1920 Oil Act went into effect, right up until, from that period of time until 1939, mining location located on that land where there had been oil leases or were valuable for oil leases were invalid, just invalid.They wouldn't even let them go on? 23JG:MH:JG: MH:JG:MH:
  J . JG:THOMAS GREENE #1That's right. They would be legally invalid because it was regarded by the Department of the Interior that the classification from one purpose was exclusive and antagonistic toward mining from one purpose was exclusive and antagonistic toward mining claims, and vice versa. If there were pre-existing mining claims, oil leases couldn't be issued.So in present day then, when you file a claim for either, say, mining or oil or something, in essence you file for the mineral rights of that claim, no matter what that mineral is. Is that correct to say? I mean like if you file a uranium claim today, you resurrected an old claim, and you happened to find another type of mineral on that claim as well as your uranium, then you would have rights to both minerals?MH:JG: That's right.MH: So then a man could get doubly rich, whereas beforehe could lose everything? You know, at one time he could have lost the whole thing, now he can keep it all.JG: Well, that's true only in the context of that conflict with old lands. But actually before the Multiple Use Act was passed and later the Surface Resources Act, if you did have a valid mining claim, you not only got what you found, such as silver, you24
 J . THOMAS GREENE #1got everything, the whole fee title. And you had the surface and the undersurface as well. You had complete title to the whole thing. That's not possibly nowadays because of the Surface Resources Act, you don't get surface r i ghts and your other multiple uses conflict.MH: So the fee title was the important thing then? If you could get the whole thing?JG: Right. If you had a valid claim, you had everything. But in the context of what you're talking about, you might have nothing if you happen to be on the wrong ground.MH: Just kind of as a concluding question, do you feel that with emphasis today on conservation and ecology, and many of the newer things regarding the air, environment, etcetera, it could possibly cause a lot of legal discomforts to the uranium industry, or to the mining industry and mining law as a whole regarding safety factors of environmental factors that mining brings about? Is there a chance that this could become an area of legal dispute?JG: Well, sure. There are always problems of that nature. There are zoning ordinances and uses. We have a client that has a lot of mining claims up in Shasta County, California, and the count y commissioners25
 J .THOMAS GREENE #1there are anxious for that the beautiful tree be maintained, that there not be smoke emitted. With ecology and anti-pollution measures now, those might be brought up as being incompatible with traditional mining operations. You're talking not about the establishment of rights, you're talking about the exploitation of the mineral when you're talking about problems in that regard. It's true that there could be conflict by reason of some of the more exploitation type of operation because it hasn't accommodated itself to the neat underground mining that has been possible to some other minerals. It's a "get in and get out" thing. There have been scars onthe earth and that type of thing could be very objectionable.Thank you.MH:26
